Officials said measles cases in west Texas and New Mexico now number about 300 and that two people have died — the first deaths from the disease in the United State since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/10/measles-is-spreading-are-you-protected/"&gt;Measles is spreading. Are you protected?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the risk of exposure to measles remains low in the Bay Area. The safest way to fight it is to get a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination shot if you’re 12 months to 3 years old, and to get two of them if you’re older than 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, but it is preventable with the MMR vaccine,” San Francisco Health Officer Dr. Susan Philip said in a statement. “If children in your family are not fully vaccinated, or if you did not have measles as a child, please get the vaccine for the best protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said California has reported five measles cases and that they all developed after international travel. They said there is no evidence that those cases are connected to the ones in New Mexico or Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious sickness and even death. It spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes and can linger in the air for several hours. Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and pink eye, followed by a rash. Health officials said children under 5 years old and adults over 20, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems are at greatest risk&lt;/p&gt;

The cases were reported on March 14, and an investigation is underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the individuals were in public settings while contagious, potentially exposing others to the virus. The following locations have been identified as possible exposure sites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 27, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kohl's&lt;/strong&gt; (12405 E 96th St N, Owasso) | 1:30 - 5:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldi&lt;/strong&gt; (9259 N Owasso Expressway, Owasso) | 4:20 - 7:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walmart Supercenter&lt;/strong&gt; (12101 E 96th St N, Owasso) | 5:15 - 8:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/strong&gt; (12905 E 96th St N, Owasso) | 7:00 - 9:21 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprouts Farmers Market&lt;/strong&gt; (9601 N 133rd E Ave, Owasso) | 7:30 - 10:02 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 2, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li data-list="bullet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowe’s Home Improvement&lt;/strong&gt; (1746 S Lynn Riggs Blvd, Claremore) | 7:00 - 9:27 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials urge anyone who visited these locations during the listed times and is unvaccinated, unsure of their vaccine status, or concerned about exposure to &lt;a href="https://redcap.health.ok.gov/surveys/?s=474CYE3F9F"&gt;complete this form&lt;/a&gt;. Health officials will provide further guidance between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those exposed who are not immune should avoid public settings for 21 days from their exposure date. Individuals experiencing flu-like symptoms, fever, or a new rash and who visited these locations should self-isolate and contact their healthcare provider before seeking medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSDH Epidemiologist-on-Call can be reached at 405-426-8710 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed these cases are linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreak and not the two cases announced on March 11. All four probable cases in Oklahoma involved unvaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per state law, measles is an immediately notifiable disease. Health care providers, laboratories, and hospitals must report suspected or confirmed cases to the OSDH immediately at 405-426-8710, available 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSDH is working with the Tulsa Health Department on this investigation and will provide updates at &lt;a href="https://Oklahoma.gov/health/measles"&gt;Oklahoma.gov/health/measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm897x4hk006n2cnt1riyebdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raw cheese made with milk from dairy cattle infected with bird flu can harbor infectious virus for months and may be a risk to public health, according to a new study from researchers at Cornell University that was funded by the US Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000j2e6bap9lbrwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raw milk cheeses are those made with milk that hasn’t been heat-treated, or pasteurized, to kill germs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000k2e6b7iyiwzwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although federal law prohibits the sale of raw milk across state lines, sales of raw milk cheese are legal nationwide as long as it’s aged at least 60 days before landing on store shelves. This requirement, which has been in place since 1949, is thought to cut the risk of contamination, since it allows development of natural acids and enzymes, which were believed to kill off pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000l2e6br53sknd0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study shows that this aging process may not inactivate the H5N1 virus, however, and it underscores the risk of consuming raw or undercooked foods during the bird flu outbreak, which continues to infect dairy cattle, poultry and a growing number of other animal species.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000m2e6bvy1g3py9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The same group of researchers previously found that H5N1 virus remained infectious in refrigerated raw milk for up to eight weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000n2e6b92yvm61q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Diego Diel, who led the study, says he thinks the virus may be so stable in milk and cheese because it’s protected by the complex matrix of molecules around it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000o2e6bi0zn9p46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The protein and fat content in the cheese and milk provide a good environment for the virus to survive at refrigeration temperature,” said Diel, an associate professor of virology at Cornell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000p2e6bc33z24f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, has said food doesn’t pose a bird flu risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000q2e6ba2tf7i4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The disease is not passed through food, so you cannot get it – as far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or milk or meat from an infected animal,” Kennedy told Fox News in an interview that aired Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000r2e6bi221cmn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s only partly true. Cats and other animals have been infected by raw cow’s milk and raw pet food, and there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;three confirmed human infections&lt;/a&gt; in which investigators were unable to determine the source of the person’s exposure to the H5N1 virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89ai78u001w2e6bcz3khi8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been no confirmed reports of people getting sick from eating or drinking bird-flu contaminated foods, including raw milk cheese, but dairy workers have been infected by getting splashed with raw milk in their faces or eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000t2e6blud14bzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s still not entirely clear whether humans can be infected by eating or drinking contaminated food, Diel said, noting that his study wasn’t really designed to answer that question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000u2e6bi9c830a3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I do think it is possible. There is a risk of infection,” he said. “It obviously depends on the dose, how much of that contaminated product is ingested.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000w2e6bc913s4r5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may also depend on the strain of virus in the milk or cheese. Diel and his team tested the stability of the B3.13 virus, which originally infected cattle in the US in March 2024. B3.13 has caused only mild disease in people. However, a new strain, D1.1, which has been associated with some severe human cases, has also crossed into cattle, further increasing the risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000x2e6box7wrn0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the study, the researchers made mini cheeses with milk they spiked with H5N1 virus. They made these cheeses at three pH levels: 6.6, 5.8 and the most acidic formula, 5.0.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89bm2oz00033b6m2gedax3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then tested the cheeses over time to see whether any virus capable of infecting cells remained. They injected samples into fertilized chicken eggs, considered the gold standard test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000y2e6bc6dx771i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of the virus remained high for the first seven days after the cheese was made and then dropped a bit in the cheeses produced at pH levels 6.6 and 5.8. But importantly, the virus remained infectious for the full two-month aging period, showing that it was remarkably stable in the cheese over a long period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000z2e6b3yarcva9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those results were confirmed by some real-world examples. The researchers tested samples of raw milk cheese from a farm that had inadvertently produced them with milk from cows infected with bird flu. These findings also showed that levels of virus stayed high and remained infectious over the full two months of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00102e6buwstdlfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our study demonstrates that HPAI H5N1 virus exhibits remarkable stability throughout the cheese making process,” the authors wrote in their &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.643009v1.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, posted ahead of peer review Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899og6k001e2e6bte2l62lq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the study suggested that making raw milk cheese more acidic may kill the virus and make the cheese safer to eat. No live virus was detected in the cheese produced at the lowest pH, 5.0. Prior studies have also shown that common pasteurization methods inactivate the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00112e6b26esg4cd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said the new study was consistent with tests of the stability of the virus in milk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00122e6b2u8vr23i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have also observed that milk can change the pH needed to inactivate the virus,” said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University, who has been studying the transmission of H5N1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00132e6bcu3mdlor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We and others have repeatedly observed that milk will prevent the degradation of the virus on surfaces, and it increases the pH stability, such that a much lower pH than normal is needed to inactivate the virus,” said Lakdawala, who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00142e6bjigre058@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA posted the findings of the study Friday along with preliminary results from its own ongoing sampling study of raw cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00152e6bawarb8zo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA sampling study, which was announced in December, has tested 110 cheese samples taken from store shelves across the country. So far, 96 of those samples were negative by polymerase chain reaction testing, or PCR, which detects live virus as well as inactive viral particles, indicating that those cheeses probably weren’t made with contaminated milk. The results from the remaining 14 samples are pending, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00162e6bpknhlkb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA is continuing to work with Federal and state partners to address the ongoing outbreak of HPAI A (H5N1) in dairy cattle.  The FDA has sampled a total of 464 pasteurized dairy products, including milk cheese butter and ice cream, all were negative for viable H5N1.  In addition, multiple research studies have confirmed that pasteurization inactivates the virus,” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle" target="_blank"&gt;the statement&lt;/a&gt; said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89anxin001z2e6brk1j3mkr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, experts say the study is a good reminder of the importance of surveillance – and of not consuming raw milk products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00172e6bb75aqn9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is another reason we should push to ensure there is no bird flu in milk products and only consume pasteurized dairy products,” Lakdawala said.

High blood levels of molecules called acylcarnitines, markers of aging metabolism, were linked to faster cognitive decline and greater Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, lifestyle choices like plant-based diets and regular exercise can effectively lower these molecules, reducing bioenergetic age and potentially delaying Alzheimer’s onset. This bioenergetic approach could help identify individuals at risk earlier and provide personalized strategies to maintain brain health without relying solely on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bioenergetic Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; High acylcarnitine levels indicate an older bioenergetic age, significantly linked to Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy living, including diet and exercise, can lower bioenergetic age, potentially offering protective benefits similar to Alzheimer’s medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; About 30% of study participants with genetic risks but favorable bioenergetic profiles may especially benefit from lifestyle interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person’s “bioenergetic age”—or how youthfully their cells generate energy—might be a key indicator of whether they’re at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, new research from Weill Cornell Medicine shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Feb. 24 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, suggests healthy living can turn back the bioenergetic clock for some people, helping them fend off Alzheimer’s as effectively as a new drug called lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108144"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman, a clock and fresh foods." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The benefit is on par with the Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s quite big because it means some people can lower their risk without the uncertain side effects of current treatments,” said senior author Dr. Jan Krumsiek, associate professor of physiology and biophysics and computational genomics in the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. The study’s first author, Dr. Matthias Arnold, is head of the computational neurobiology team at Helmholtz Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings bring us a step closer to solving a long-standing puzzle. One of the early warning signs of Alzheimer’s is that brain cells start losing their ability to produce and use energy efficiently, such as metabolizing glucose (sugar). But some people don’t show disease symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This delay between abnormalities in energy pathways and the onset of symptomatic disease suggests there is a “bioenergetic capacity” that provides a buffer for these individuals. Their bodies and brains are better at keeping energy levels up even when problems start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these cases, people can be unusually healthy when we look at their cognition,” said Dr. Krumsiek, who is also a member of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine. “They make it to old age without the kind of declines that usually creep in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could the researchers identify individuals with this beneficial higher bioenergetic capacity and help those without it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Tool to Predict Risk of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krumsiek and his colleagues turned to a group of molecules called acylcarnitines, which are associated with declining cognition and breaking down or metabolizing fats and proteins for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test if high acylcarnitine levels in the blood could predict who’s at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, the researchers used data from a large-scale study called the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating,” Dr. Krumsiek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dividing research participants into groups based on their specific acylcarnitine levels highlighted people with more severe Alzheimer’s disease and others with fewer symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led the researchers to define a bioenergetic clock based on acylcarnitines—how old a person’s metabolism acts, compared to actual age. Higher bioenergetic age is linked to higher acylcarnitine levels, worsened Alzheimer’s pathology, cognitive decline and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also quantified cognitive decline using a common test called the mini-mental state examination, on which a score below 24 out of 30 points indicates impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that people with low acylcarnitine levels to begin with declined more slowly, losing about 0.5 points less per year than people with high acylcarnitine levels. The benefit is on par with the Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some degree, a person’s bioenergetic clock ticks forward at a rate determined by their genetics, but having a healthy lifestyle—for example, eating a plant-based diet and exercising —can help keep acylcarnitine levels low, which means a younger bioenergetic age, Dr. Krumsiek explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They went on to identify a subgroup of participants, about 30% of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with older bioenergetic age but favorable genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals may benefit more from early lifestyle interventions designed to decrease their bioenergetic age and potentially delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Dr. Krumsiek hopes to home in on the lifestyle interventions most effective for lowering bioenergetic age. For example, eating a low-carb diet may help maintain metabolic health, but just how low would carbohydrate consumption have to be for a person to see benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also points to an inexpensive, rapid test that could determine a person’s acylcarnitine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fortunate that these blood tests—originally developed to identify metabolic and mitochondrial disorders in newborns—can also help assess a person’s bioenergetic age,” Dr. Krumsiek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can repurpose this technology for older adults, that could provide a way to start personalized treatment earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this bioenergetic age and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7113100145414145311c14155f121e031f141d1d5f141504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Prempeh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Barbara Prempeh – Weill Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57032-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Jan Krumsiek et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a systemic “bioenergetic capacity”, the individual ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker presentations of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be achieved using existing clinical assays.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:44:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5jcEJueTBrSDdiX2h3d2Y5NlcxZEJKMTBEQjJVZzU5QnplTm9ndU9WQm92NjIyTG00YkNEU0oyNDJkLTlmYmtxR3NpaEhpZUNobDhCcE9VYjVqcDB3TnVORmUtVXctVGo4aUVBOEllVE0</guid></item><item><title>US measles cases reach 5-year high; 15 states report cases, Texas outbreak grows - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNeTA1X29qdV83SWt6UUdZNW44OUI0NFBNa1FqZ0RWaExSUmU0R2lCOG1oUlVfbUhvWnNoTlh6cm5nOTl2bmdHZU1tMjZhNWE0Z2FSVTFSSzROVDRUM3d0dXY3MkxLcTdWc3BYOUc1N0I5WVZBS0tXU3VIbmppZVpiN3JPM3FfellwdFduMjRMbWdSTFNZVDBMbkN6amVYbzQ0ZWJYSTYzZ28zNzdtRjBPbTl2UUlGOHkwVUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;The US has now recorded over 300 measles cases just three months into 2025, exceeding the yearly case counts for all years after 2019. The bulk of this year's cases are from an outbreak that erupted in an undervaccinated county in West Texas in late January, which has since spread to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-spills-into-third-state-as-cases-reach-258/"&gt;New Mexico and Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the afternoon of March 14, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas reports 259 cases&lt;/a&gt; across 11 counties, 34 hospitalizations, and one death, which occurred in an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl. &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico reports 35 cases&lt;/a&gt; across two counties, two hospitalizations, and one death. That death occurred in an unvaccinated adult who did not seek medical treatment and tested positive for the virus posthumously. The cause of death is still under investigation. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Oklahoma reports two probable cases&lt;/a&gt; linked to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, 12 other states have reported at least one confirmed measles case since the start of the year: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this year has seen three measles outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 13, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;301 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, which do not include 36 new cases reported today in Texas and two in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Measles is back”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, when health officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;victoriously declared measles eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; thanks to concerted vaccination campaigns, only three other years have had higher tallies of measles cases. In 2014, the country saw 667 measles cases. In 2018, there were 381 cases. And in 2019—&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/were-embarrassed-us-health-experts-chagrined-by-measles-resurgence/"&gt;when the country was on the verge of losing its elimination status&lt;/a&gt;—there was a startling 1,274 cases, largely driven by massive outbreaks in New York. Measles is considered eliminated if there is no continuous spread in the country over the course of at least 12 months. (This is not to be confused with "eradication," which is defined as "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm"&gt;permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence&lt;/a&gt;" of an infectious disease. Smallpox and rinderpest are the only pathogens humans have eradicated.)&lt;/p&gt;

In preclinical mouse models, terpenes such as geraniol and linalool significantly reduced chronic pain, providing promising alternatives to opioid medications and avoiding THC’s psychoactive side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terpenes appear to act through the adenosine A2a receptor, indicating a potential sedative mechanism.

Geraniol provided the most significant level of pain relief, followed by linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With fibromyalgia, there isn’t much understanding of what the pain state is, and there are not a lot of great options for treating it,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that terpenes may be a viable treatment option for fibromyalgia pain, which could potentially have a large impact and make a difference for an under-treated population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder that affects up to 5% of the world’s population, according to research published in Healthcare (Basel) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health estimates about 4 million U.S. adults have fibromyalgia, which affects women more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-surgical pain straddles the line between acute pain and chronic pain. It is usually short in duration, but it also involves physiological changes such as increased inflammation and sensitization of the body’s pain system that contribute to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Opioids do a good job controlling post-surgical pain, but they can cause constipation that can increase the chances of post-surgical complications such as adhesions,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are always looking for better options, and this study suggests that terpenes could be a novel therapeutic for post-operative pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, approximately 310 million major surgeries are performed each year, according to 2020 research published in the International Journal of Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research that is being done by Dr. Streicher’s lab on terpenes and their potential to help those who suffer from chronic pain demonstrates the importance of basic research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are hundreds of unique chemicals that plants make, including the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis&lt;/em&gt; plant, that are undiscovered,” said Todd Vanderah, PhD, director of the Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction at the U of A Health Sciences and professor and head of the Department of Pharmacology at the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Nature is incredible at making unique chemical structures, and many of these chemicals are unknowns when it comes to their abilities to aid in human health, diseases and disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A great current example is medication semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, which has a chemical structure that was isolated not from a plant, but from an animal that is prevalent in the Southwest, the Gila monster. These discoveries from natural products through research such as Dr. Streicher’s can result in very useful medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also demonstrated that the mechanism of action of terpenes on post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain was the same as in previous studies. Its action through the adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor – a receptor that caffeine targets and blocks – suggests a sedative effect that could be the subject of future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher’s co-authors were Caleb Seekins, who worked in Streicher’s lab as an undergraduate biochemistry student and is now pursuing a medical degree at the College of Medicine – Tucson; Alyssa Welborn, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2024; and Abigail Schwarz, who finished her doctorate in Streicher’s lab in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health under award no.

Our lab found that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene relieve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy via Adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests terpenes as potential non-opioid, non-cannabinoid therapeutics. In this study, we investigated post-operative and fibromyalgia pain, expanding potential terpene applications to different pain types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female CD-1 mice had their baseline mechanical sensitivity measured via von Frey filaments and underwent either paw incision surgery or reserpine-induced fibromyalgia (0.32 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;sc&lt;/em&gt;). After pain was established, the mice received 200 mg/kg &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt; of a terpene, and their mechanical sensitivity was measured over three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the potential mechanism of action, mice were given the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist istradefylline (3.2 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt;) 10 min before terpene, with mechanical sensitivity measured after. Hot plate pain testing was performed as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpene treatment caused time-dependent elevation of the mechanical thresholds of the mice from both pain models, strongest for geraniol, then linalool or α-humulene, indicating that these four terpenes are anti-nociceptive in post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretreatment with istradefylline blocked antinociception, suggesting the terpenes act via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R in these pain models. Terpenes had no effect on hot plate latencies, ruling out non-specific motor effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene may be a viable medication for post-operative and fibromyalgia pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mechanism of action via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R furthers our knowledge of its importance in pain processing and as a target of terpene drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:20:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1fYnh2RG1XR29lSlpnenhBQ0I2a245Y1lkRjdhOUM3ZjRMSVJsYl9GWFZvak5XWVJtNnpGcGdJem5lSEM2ekdSRXg4RjJzWEM2YUZOUGpTVFRXZDc4b3prRHo5emRYS1AyYVh4emFoY19aVGJGbWlEajU0WQ</guid></item><item><title>Dr. Oz says probiotic supplements have wide-ranging health benefits.

The unit houses older, medically dependent men in four-bed pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other inmates in two sections of the same unit have tested negative at this point, but the unit is still being kept under quarantine and those in the two sections are being treated. The department said restrictions on visits and volunteer services to the unit are expected to be lifted by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is being provided following guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes washing clothing and bedding in a disinfectant. The health department is also providing education about hygiene and preventing the spread of scabies to inmates and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scabies is an infestation from a mite that burrows into the upper level of a person's skin and lays eggs. It is typically spread by prolonged skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the health department said there has been ongoing issues with a skin rash, possibly caused by laundry soap, in multiple units at the prison that is not contagious. The rash makes it difficult to identify scabies cases without testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNQlFuT2F0T0JkLTlETS1PcFU0VmVHUFp5QmNyd3pabDZ0SFo3bzNfTXBKc2gySmhDdlB5QXg4czZsTThOVjBHaXpueWVlYTZvWDFvLV9YVnR4RG5xcExYX0VZY1J2bmZpYjUxeHZ4bWpEa2ZIQzRLR0pFUVlxSHBBMTdQeEE1RnVfeWV4eGM0MTVzZnhfaWhmMjdEVzhIblFyLU4tQmtlalJxRC14Qy15ZTBYOA</guid></item><item><title>Aging might not be enough to eliminate H5N1 viruses in raw-milk cheese - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNNTdoRlpMUEJWd25tYkxrMk1ibDV3TG1lZ25UcFRUMVZlbWVGSXVWb3hjM29xeGhidWZEOWtWem0yUnNOdG85cWdPdnNKVVIwMmRsT0JwdTJWa2RrcXA2QXp1dWJlOVdFSnk0MlEzMDhmajcydm9Palo3UEZBWDBzbkF3RjlJczdtZ2JFM1hmTDNsb0Y1SldrNk5vOW9BZlplaHNEMlNSeDl4ZUdnNHRHMzllYVEzbDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheeses made with raw milk are popular in the United States and the rest of the world, and the products are required to be aged for at least 60 days to inactivate bacterial pathogens. The fairly recent detection of H5N1 avian flu in dairy cattle, however, raises questions about whether the same process can inactive the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer appears to be no, in most instances, scientists from Cornell University reported today on &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.643009v1.full.pdf"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, a preprint server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the state of New York funded the study as part of efforts to assess the threat of H5N1 avian flu from potentially contaminated raw milk cheese. Separately, the FDA in December 2024 launched an effort to test nearly 300 60-day aged raw milk cheese samples, and today it provided an update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; today, the FDA said that, of 110 samples that have been collected so far, 96 were negative on polymerase chain reaction testing. Tests on 14 others are still in progress. No samples have yet to test positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study findings raise food safety concerns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Cornell study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, researchers made raw-milk cheese from raw milk spiked with H5N1 under different pH levels, ranging from 6.6 to 5.0—all in the acidic range. They also tested samples of raw milk cheddar cheese that was inadvertently produced with H5N1-contaminated raw milk after an outbreak in dairy cows on a farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cheese made with the spiked milk, tests show that infectious virus remained throughout the cheese-making process and for up to 60 days of aging at the 6.6- and 5.8-pH levels. The virus didn't survive at the 5.0-pH level, which is the most acidic, supporting earlier findings that influenza A viruses are sensitive to acidic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingestion of contaminated raw dairy products repeatedly may increase the probability of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators said their findings raise food safety concerns, not just for aged raw-milk cheese, but for other raw-milk products, especially given that the virus can persist for up to 56 days under refrigeration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the infectious dose of the virus to humans is not known, ingestion of contaminated raw dairy products repeatedly may increase the probability of infections," the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NYC probes infections in cats; USDA notes more poultry detections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other avian flu developments, the New York City Health Department today said it is investigating two cats in separate households that have H5 avian flu infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/press/2025/03142025-bird-flu-cats.pdf"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, officials didn't say how the cats might have been exposed. They urged people to avoid feeding pets raw food or raw milk and to prevent animals from roaming outdoors, where they may come into contact with wild birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials added that the risk to people remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported more H5N1 detections in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; in two states. They include two backyard flocks in different counties in Oklahoma and a live-poultry market in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A giant pouched rat’s sense of smell is so strong that they could conceivably detect half a drop of chlorine in a space the size of 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools, says APOPO’s head of training Cindy Fast, a behavioral neuroscientist who coaches the rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And while rats may be much-maligned in society, Carolina and her peers in East Africa have raised detection rates for TB—the leading cause of death worldwide by infectious disease—by &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apopo.org/what-we-do/detecting-tuberculosis/where-we-work/apopo-in-tanzania" target="_blank"&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; at local clinics, where patient samples undergo a smear test under a microscope that is, according to Agizew, usually only 20 to 40 percent accurate.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have unveiled the first real look at a mitochondrial protein strongly linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, revealing key details in how its malfunction might play a critical role in the disease's progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1096284"&gt;have known&lt;/a&gt; for more than two decades that mutations in the gene for a protein called PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) can trigger early-onset  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="154962" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, but the mechanisms at play have remained a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Australia used advanced imaging technology to not only determine the structure of PINK1, but to show how the protein attaches to cellular power houses and how they are activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154965" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154965" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ProteinDiagram.jpg" alt="Protein diagram" class="wp-image-154965 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ProteinDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ProteinDiagram-600x288.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154965" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;PINK1 works through a protein complex called TOM-VDAC. (Callegari et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant milestone for research into Parkinson's," &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/news/scientists-solve-decades-long-parkinsons-mystery/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; WEHI medical biologist David Komander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is incredible to finally see PINK1 and understand how it binds to mitochondria. Our structure reveals many new ways to change PINK1, essentially switching it on, which will be life-changing for people with Parkinson's."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PINK1 protein is an important maintenance worker in the body. In healthy mitochondria, the protein passes through the outer and inner membranes, where it sinks out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mitochondria that have broken down, the protein is forced to pause half way through, tagging the power house for deletion through a series of processes that release a chemical signal called ubiquitin. When mutations prevent PINK1 from doing its job, dysfunctional mitochondria aren't cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain cells are particularly energy hungry, making the replacement of inefficient power units vital in order to prevent the neurodegeneration that triggers conditions like Parkinson's disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the team used techniques including cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to study PINK1 and mitochondria close-up, finding their attachment is based on a specific protein complex called TOM-VDAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, but if treatments to repair the functionality of the protein can be developed, that may then give us a way of reducing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;the risk of Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; or slowing its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've seen human PINK1 docked to the surface of damaged mitochondria and it has uncovered a remarkable array of proteins that act as the docking site," &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/news/scientists-solve-decades-long-parkinsons-mystery/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Sylvie Callegari, from WEHI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also saw, for the first time, how mutations present in people with Parkinson's disease affect human PINK1."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's is a complex disease, with undoubtedly numerous contributing factors. Yet by identifying the mechanisms behind proteins like PINK1, researchers move closer to understanding what the many causes have in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu6445"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They also say they are unsure of that person's vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the patient returned home on February 27, first experienced symptoms on March 7, and the rash emerged on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the period of possible transmission is from March 3 to March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say they have identified two places where the public may have been exposed. They are the Emergency Room at Henry Ford Rochester on University Drive on both March 8 and March 10. The second location is the Kruse and Muir restaurant on Main in Rochester from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles virus stays active in the air for 2 hours after an infectious person leaves. Early symptoms you should be on the lookout for include fever, runny nose, and pink eye. If you are experiencing any of those symptoms, you should not seek treatment without calling the provider first so they can take appropriate precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related Video: Can adults get a measles shot if they don't know their childhood vaccine status?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know someone who seems to defy aging—people who look younger than their peers despite being the same age. What's their secret? Scientists at Osaka University (Japan) may have found a way to quantify this difference. By incorporating hormone (steroid) metabolism pathways into an AI-driven model, they have developed a new system to estimate a person's biological age, a measure of how well their body has aged, rather than just counting the years since birth.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Using just five drops of blood, this new method analyzes 22 key steroids and their interactions to provide a more precise health assessment. The team's breakthrough study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt2624" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, offers a potential step forward in personalized health management, allowing for earlier detection of age-related health risks and tailored interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the body's aging signature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging isn't just about the number of years we've lived—it's shaped by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Traditional methods for estimating biological age rely on broad biomarkers, such as DNA methylation or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/protein+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protein levels&lt;/a&gt;, but these approaches often overlook the intricate hormonal networks that regulate the body's internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our bodies rely on hormones to maintain homeostasis, so we thought, why not use these as key indicators of aging?" says Dr. Qiuyi Wang, co-first author of the study. To test this idea, the research team focused on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/steroid+hormones/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;steroid hormones&lt;/a&gt;, which play a crucial role in metabolism, immune function, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A new AI-powered model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team developed a deep neural network (DNN) model that incorporates steroid metabolism pathways, making it the first AI model to explicitly account for the interactions between different steroid molecules. Instead of looking at absolute steroid levels—which can vary widely between individuals—the model examines steroid ratios, providing a more personalized and accurate assessment of biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our approach reduces the noise caused by individual steroid level differences and allows the model to focus on meaningful patterns," explains Dr. Zi Wang, co-first and corresponding author of this work. The model was trained on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from hundreds of individuals, revealing that biological age differences tend to widen as people get older—an effect the researchers liken to a river widening as it flows downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key insights and implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the study's most striking findings involves cortisol, a steroid hormone commonly associated with stress. The researchers found that when cortisol levels doubled, biological age increased by approximately 1.5 times. This suggests that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; could accelerate aging at a biochemical level, reinforcing the importance of stress management in maintaining long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stress is often discussed in general terms, but our findings provide concrete evidence that it has a measurable impact on biological aging," says Professor Toshifumi Takao, a corresponding author and an expert in analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe this AI-powered biological age model could pave the way for more personalized health monitoring. Future applications may include early disease detection, customized wellness programs, and even lifestyle recommendations tailored to slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study represents a significant step forward, the team acknowledges that biological aging is a complex process influenced by many factors beyond hormones. "This is just the beginning," says Dr. Z. Wang. "By expanding our dataset and incorporating additional biological markers, we hope to refine the model further and unlock deeper insights into the mechanisms of aging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ongoing advancements in AI and biomedical research, the dream of accurately measuring—and even slowing—biological aging is becoming increasingly feasible. For now, though, the ability to assess one's "aging speed" with a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/simple+blood+test/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;simple blood test&lt;/a&gt; could mark a game-changing development in preventive health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative RNA splicing is like a movie editor cutting and rearranging scenes from the same footage to create different versions of a film. By selecting which scenes to keep and which to leave out, the editor can produce a drama, a comedy, or even a thriller—all from the same raw material. Similarly, cells splice RNA in different ways to produce a variety of proteins from a single gene, fine-tuning their function based on need. However, when cancer rewrites the script, this process goes awry, fueling tumor growth and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a recent study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56913-8" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in the Feb. 15 issue of &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, scientists from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and UConn Health not only show how cancer hijacks this tightly regulated splicing and rearranging of RNA but also introduce a potential therapeutic strategy that could slow or even shrink aggressive and hard-to-treat tumors. This discovery could transform how we treat aggressive cancers, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/triple-negative+breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tumors&lt;/a&gt;, where current treatment options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this work, led by Olga Anczuków, an associate professor at JAX and co-program leader at the NCI-designated JAX Cancer Center, are tiny genetic elements called poison exons, nature's own "off switch" for protein production. When these exons are included in an RNA message, they trigger its destruction before a protein can be made—preventing harmful cellular activity. In &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy cells&lt;/a&gt;, poison exons regulate the levels of key proteins, keeping the genetic machinery in check. But in cancer, this safety mechanism often fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anczuków and her team, including Nathan Leclair, an MD/Ph.D. graduate student at UConn Health and The Jackson Laboratory who spearheaded the research, and Mattia Brugiolo, a staff researcher who contributed his expertise, discovered that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; suppress poison &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exon/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;exon&lt;/a&gt; activity in a critical gene called TRA2β. As such, levels of TRA2β protein increase inside cancer cells, causing tumor proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team found a correlation between levels of poison exons and patient outcomes. "We've shown for the first time that low levels of poison exon inclusion in the TRA2β gene are associated with poor outcomes in many different cancer types, and especially in aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancers," said Anczuków. These include &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, brain tumors, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/ovarian+cancers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ovarian cancers&lt;/a&gt;, skin cancers, leukemias, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, Anczuków explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anczuków, Leclair, and Brugiolo then went on to see if they could increase the inclusion of the poison exon in the TRA2β gene and reactivate the kill switch. They found their answer in antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)—synthetic RNA fragments that can be designed to increase poison exon inclusion in specific ways. When introduced into cancer cells, ASOs effectively flipped the genetic switch, restoring the body's natural ability to degrade excess TRA2β RNA and inhibit tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that ASOs can rapidly boost poison exon inclusion, essentially tricking the cancer cell into turning off its own growth signals," said Leclair. "These poison exons work like a rheostat, quickly adjusting protein levels—and that could make ASOs a highly precise and effective therapy for aggressive cancers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when researchers completely removed TRA2β proteins using CRISPR gene editing, tumors continued to grow—suggesting that targeting the RNA rather than the protein could be a more effective approach. "This tells us that poison-exon-containing RNA doesn't just silence TRA2β," explained Anczuków. "It likely sequesters other RNA-binding proteins, creating an even more toxic environment for cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further studies will refine ASO-based therapies and explore their delivery to tumors. However, preliminary data suggest that ASOs are highly specific and do not interfere with normal cellular function, making them promising candidates for future cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

Kathy Hochul to temporarily shut down markets in the New York City metro area to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the wet markets reopened in mid-February, inspectors have found the virus in birds at &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seven more&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s roughly 70 wet markets, which remain open and serve thousands of customers weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture, which performs quarterly unannounced inspections and bird flu testing at the markets, said it may order another shutdown if clear evidence persists that bird flu is spreading in the live poultry business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have highlighted the city’s wet markets as environments where viruses spreading between animal species can mutate and potentially become more transmittable to humans. While there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html?cove-tab=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;70 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu spreading to humans nationwide since 2024 – including one fatality – none have been in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Jose Fernandez at La Granja market in West Harlem earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, New York City’s wet markets continue to sell thousands of birds a month, according to state data from 2023. One estimate from 2021 put the total at roughly 1 million live birds per month. Several customers interviewed for this story said they prefer the fresher, higher-quality meat from these markets, while others count on them for halal or other specific slaughter practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="streamfield-embed streamfield-embed-default streamfield-paragraph mb-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘The meat tastes completely different&lt;/b&gt;’&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Granja Live Poultry, an unassuming corner storefront in West Harlem next to an artisanal coffee roaster selling $7 espresso tonics, is quiet from the outside. But inside, cages packed with squawking chickens as well as turkeys, quails and even rabbits line the walls from floor to ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend an hour there and you’ll hear a half-dozen languages, including Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic and Bengali. Owner Jose Fernandez, who has run the store since 1999, said he gets just about every type of customer you can imagine – except one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have too many customers that are white people, because they don’t cook too much,” Fernandez said, laughing. “They eat in the restaurant, so their life is very different. In my house we cook every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;A price list at La Granja market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez, originally from the Dominican Republic, said his customers are mostly like him: people with roots in other countries who are used to eating chickens raised outside on a diet of corn, grass, and insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The meat tastes completely different from the meat you can buy at the supermarket or butcher,” Fernandez said in Spanish. “People who come here know the difference, the taste of real chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many of his customers follow halal or other dietary laws, Fernandez said, which require specific slaughter methods he can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said he sells about 4,000 chickens a week, he said, along with small numbers of game birds and rabbits. The corkboard walls of his tiny office at the front of the store are covered with supplier invoices and the business cards of various officials at the federal and state Departments of Agriculture. He said his store underwent regular unannounced inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the shop floor, staff regularly sweep and hose down the tile. Behind a counter in the back, birds are plucked and processed in about eight minutes, returning whole or in pieces, encased in plastic and resembling the chicken sold at the Whole Foods a few blocks east (though considerably cheaper at $3.20 per pound versus $4.49 per pound advertised at the Whole Foods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Customers examine the live birds at La Granja earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tania Cardenas, originally from Ecuador, recently picked up two chickens at La Granja – “The Farm,” in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re better this way,” Cardenas said in Spanish. “For my health, I prefer fresh. When they’re slaughtered here and I can see the blood drain, I know I’m eating something fresh that won’t make me sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the risks of shopping at wet markets outweigh any benefits. While properly cooked eggs and meat are safe to eat, a wide body of literature has identified such markets as high-risk sites for transmitting disease from animals to humans – most notably as &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2025-03-11/what-caused-covid-19-what-we-know-5-years-later" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a potential origin&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live poultry markets create ideal conditions for this “zoonotic” transmission, according to Ann Linder, associate director of policy and research at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Program and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Animal-Markets-and-Zoonotic-Disease-Risk-high-resolution.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; that examined disease transmission at wet markets in 15 countries, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birds from multiple farms are mixed together, increasing the risk that one may carry a pathogen, she said. Because they are packed into tight quarters, often in stressful conditions that weaken their immune systems, they become more vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the ongoing bird flu outbreak, which started in 2022 and picked up sharply again this year, is largely concentrated in major “factory farm” producers in the Midwest, that doesn’t guarantee that the city’s wet markets are safe, Linder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Owner Jose Fernandez says most of his customers shop at La Granja because they prefer the taste of fresh chicken, or they have dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a constant influx of new birds and new potential pathogens,” Linder said, referring to the fact that birds are sourced from multiple farms. She said wet markets are especially risky because customers examine the birds up close and the animals are slaughtered on site, potentially creating more avenues for transmission. Additionally, she said that because wet markets often operate in dense, residential neighborhoods in New York City, an outbreak that starts here could be especially hard to contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with more bird flu detections at the city’s wet markets since their reopening than before the initial shutdown, activists, city councilmembers, and even Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa are questioning why they remain open. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to bird flu, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States there have been 70 cases of bird flu detected in humans since the current outbreak began spiking again in 2024, with one fatality reported in Louisiana in January. For now, the disease does not appear to spread easily from animals to humans, but public health experts expressed concern that it will mutate to become more easily transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I literally don’t think there’s anything any market could do to actually be shut down,” said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights organization New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birnkrant has been documenting conditions at some of the city’s wet markets for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds,” Birnkrant said of a store in Queens that she visited on Tuesday. “Many we found with open wounds because the birds are cannibalizing each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantal Fernandez, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Health, said that while her agency provides guidance to workers on proper protective equipment and handling dead birds, they don’t have a specific program to educate consumers about the risks these markets pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarra Jagne, a professor of public and ecosystem health at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine who has studied Northeast U.S. bird markets extensively, said that strict regulations introduced in 2003 made the markets much safer, such as one mandating that different species be caged separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent cases of bird flu in markets are to be expected given the ongoing national outbreak, she said, but do not highlight an inherent problem with the markets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been to many, many of these markets, and the change from before is just enormous,” Jarra said, referring to the period before the 2003 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at La Granja, Fernandez said the state’s monitoring and detection program is sufficient for him and his customers to feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand surged after the weeklong shutdown before business normalized and then slowed a little, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not sure why. It could be the economy, he said. But most likely it’s the usual seasonal pattern – his customers often give up meat for Lent and Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUzVLaU05UTdxLW1YdHNrbHVUX0l2TEtOTkxuNXNIRExtQVBqUUpqNUpkelZvSVZnbXNWc28wQVhrM3FyYkFwT0VxeEt0eng2RzlWSVc5VERrWDZJd1pCSFNncFVlWEY3aTRVUllpclhJZVRucVNTcHZ0QXZkRWFnS1BKcjRtbm80ZHo4Ti04Nmc5T1JvYkZ4eUpjako2dWc</guid></item><item><title>Top nutrition expert shares the No. 1 mistake he sees in American diets - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVlHTTJScjRrOTBRcEVWa1Jlb202OUJtSmFRVWFmUXNFdFZiYm1BVkh6TXVTaEd1UGlQOThTbHhtVm1FenlpQlFMd1luSGxFU0FqcUpvcTlUSVA3YllzZGVXNko0RDJ6TEtHTGtMaUhSX0IxNk10MU5KYlRiUkpfODZZTnhDYzVBSzJQSzhkeEZrMzN1UXVSTjZ5T0c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-fac7c12f-7 ifTevn"&gt;&lt;img alt="photo of Tim Spector." data-content-placement="primary_image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="impression-element" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=75 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=75 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=75 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=75 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=75 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=75 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=75 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;p data-cy="caption" class="sc-13b6974d-9 dKtuAn"&gt;“We’re often failing in nutrition to think about…what does your plate look like,” gut health expert and epidemiologist Tim Spector says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-cy="credit" class="sc-13b6974d-10 hbPqHz"&gt;Mike Marsland—Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVlHTTJScjRrOTBRcEVWa1Jlb202OUJtSmFRVWFmUXNFdFZiYm1BVkh6TXVTaEd1UGlQOThTbHhtVm1FenlpQlFMd1luSGxFU0FqcUpvcTlUSVA3YllzZGVXNko0RDJ6TEtHTGtMaUhSX0IxNk10MU5KYlRiUkpfODZZTnhDYzVBSzJQSzhkeEZrMzN1UXVSTjZ5T0c</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Finally Solve the Case of Egypt’s ‘Pregnant Mummy’—And It’s Not What We Expected - Indian Defence Review</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNM2NLdmJXbTBRaHVmZTY0RGIwbktpQmFuVldvS1cyNzA5ajBZMzFPTzU0TThyZGVVbzM0ZGl0VmJUMjc1LUk3TERidGpfTlNRb0ZTc0JqZFpOemhLdnh0bWdEV1h0UXBoWm9MSTR4UUxkRFZHUTZ3R0FDWTRtNmhGWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study has put an end to a four-year-long scientific debate regarding the “Mysterious Lady,” an ancient Egyptian mummy originally thought to be pregnant and suffering from cancer. First discovered in Luxor and housed in Poland since 1826, this mummy was long misidentified as a male priest until a 2021 analysis suggested it was a young woman carrying a fetus. The same study also raised suspicions of nasopharyngeal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, a new examination by an international team of 14 researchers has debunked both claims, revealing that what was believed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process, and that there is no concrete evidence of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440321001746" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this latest analysis meticulously reexamined over 1,300 CT scan images of the mummy, offering a far more precise understanding of its condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mistaken Pregnancy: Embalming Materials, Not a Fetus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, researchers from the Warsaw Mummy Project made a groundbreaking claim: the mummy of the &lt;strong&gt;Mysterious Lady &lt;/strong&gt;contained a fetus between 6.5 and 7.5 months old. They based this assertion on CT scans that showed a cluster of materials inside the woman’s abdomen. Unable to find distinct fetal bones, they hypothesized that the acidity of the mother’s womb had dissolved the skeleton, essentially “pickling” the fetus over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This claim was controversial from the start. Several specialists expressed skepticism, questioning whether it was even possible for fetal bones to degrade under such conditions. The new study firmly refutes the earlier interpretation, showing that the abdominal mass was nothing more than embalming materials. In response to the initial claims, radiologist and mummy expert&lt;strong&gt; Sahar Saleem &lt;/strong&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Live Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to “identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further disprove the original hypothesis, the new team emphasized a key fact: while acidity can dissolve bones under certain conditions, embalming fluid would have neutralized the necessary chemical processes, making it scientifically implausible for the fetus to simply vanish. The supposed fetal remains turned out to be four separate bundles of embalming materials, likely placed inside the mummy’s abdomen as part of the preservation process, a common ancient &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/archaeologists-suggests-ancient-egyptians-built-pyramids-with-an-ancient-high-tech-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="74443"&gt;Egyptian funerary practice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kownacki)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;No Evidence of Cancer: Skull Damage Explained&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the pregnancy claim, the 2021 study also suggested that the Mysterious Lady suffered from &lt;strong&gt;nasopharyngeal cancer&lt;/strong&gt;, based on irregularities in her skull. This was another startling revelation, as it would have been one of the earliest known cases of cancer identified in an Egyptian mummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, the latest research shows that these skull deformations were most likely caused by the embalming process itself, rather than disease. The removal of &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/researchers-have-deciphered-the-death-wave-in-the-brain/" data-type="post" data-id="70741"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;, a standard part of mummification, often involved breaking through the skull to extract soft tissue. This process could easily account for the structural damage seen in the CT scans. None of the 14 experts involved in the latest study could find clear signs of cancerous growth, leading them to conclude that the previous interpretation was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This misdiagnosis highlights a wider challenge in mummy studies—distinguishing between post-mortem damage, embalming artifacts, and actual disease. While cancer has been identified in other mummies, scientists must be cautious in making such determinations, especially when relying solely on imaging rather than direct tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Importance of Reevaluating Mummy Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resolution of this debate is more than just a correction of scientific misunderstanding. It serves as a cautionary tale about the challenges of interpreting ancient remains. Mummified bodies undergo significant post-mortem changes due to embalming, environmental conditions, and centuries of decay. As a result, distinguishing biological realities from preservation techniques requires extremely detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The intense public interest in the “pregnant mummy” case underscores how sensational claims can spread quickly, even before they are fully confirmed. The Warsaw Mummy Project’s findings were widely reported as a groundbreaking discovery, only for subsequent research to dismantle their conclusions. While their work was based on legitimate scientific inquiry, the study demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary verification in mummy research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest team of researchers concluded that this case should “resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer.” Going forward, they recommend shifting focus to broader questions, such as maternal health in ancient Egypt, rather than isolated cases that might be misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

She said she was also experiencing dizziness, blurred vision, and a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Three women were found dead in the above hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in San Pedro on February 22.

She spent the next three hours seated in a chair by an open window before she was finally able to walk uninhibited again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five days after returning home to California, Jane says she is still struggling with headaches, a cough, brain-fog, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said that one of her friends on the trip has also been suffering from recurring migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the symptoms described by Jane are textbook side effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after reading a report by DailyMail.com earlier this week about Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths possibly being &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14487175/american-women-dead-belize-dramatic-twist-new-theory.html"&gt;caused by carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning that Jane connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It all started to make perfect sense because I was completely out of it, and I did not feel right,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Every morning after that, I felt like I was in a fog. And I still don’t feel right now, everything feels off.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane is seeking medical treatment and plans to reach out to Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy to report her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends on the trip was told by embassy officials that initial tests found some rooms at the hotel contained ‘high levels of carbon monoxide.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy have not returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review on Royal Kahal’s Trip Advisor page, dated March 1, complains of ‘critical safety concerns’ during a visit to the resort in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had a wonderful stay at Royal Kahal Beach Resort from February 17th-21st. The staff was exceptional - [the] front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, bartenders, and beach staff went above and beyond. The beauty of San Pedro, Belize, and the warmth of its people made this trip unforgettable,’ wrote user Naquana H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, I cannot, in good faith, rate the hotel highly due to serious safety concerns. On February 18th, our carbon monoxide detector went off with levels above 400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite informing the front desk, the staff seemed unfamiliar with the issue. Maintenance suggested turning off the gas, but the CO levels remained dangerously high. We were left feeling uneasy. The next morning, a friend reported dizziness, which we now suspect was from CO exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While the hotel is beautiful, the lack of CO detectors is concerning. I urge management to address this for the safety of future guests.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The women's families paid tribute to each of them in a heartfelt statement on Monday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A review posted on Trip Advisor just over a week ago complained of carbon monoxide exposure and 'critical' safety concerns at Royal Kahal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it remains to be seen whether Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, Jane said she’s furious the hotel lured her into a potentially dangerous situation with false promises of guaranteed safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her heart breaks for the women’s families and feels remarkably lucky to have avoided any serious harm herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They told us everything was safe, and we believed them. We had no reason not to,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I can’t get the girls and their families off my mind. It’s heartbreaking. But it’s also frightening knowing the same thing could’ve happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Who knows what would’ve happened if I was left to sleep in my room for another few hours, or if when I fell on the ground I couldn’t get up and nobody came to check on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just so sad those girls weren’t afforded the same luck.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said she realized all was not well at Royal Kahal almost immediately after she and her friends arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she says the staff were incredibly welcoming and the property was serene, there were signs plastered all over saying the hotel would be conducting smoke detector tests the following day between 9 am and 3 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Then all the weird stuff started happening,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next morning at 9 am, Jane said maids let themselves into her room and asked her if she was ready for house cleaning after she’d just emerged from the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she thought it odd at the time, what really stands out to Jane now is the fact that Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar had been dead for more than a day before hotel staff raised the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They were in our rooms every single morning,’ Jane said. ‘So I don’t know if they changed their policy after [the three women died] or if they knew more Americans were coming to make sure nobody else got sick - I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just found that really odd.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane left the hotel that morning and didn’t hear any alarm tests being carried out before she left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she returned, she found a worker with a ladder inside who was removing all of the smoke detectors from her room and her friend’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worker left the smoke detectors on the counter. One of Jane's friends called the front desk to ask whether they should reinstall them but were told ‘no’ and instructed to leave them on the counter where they remained for the rest of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on Wednesday March 5th and for the majority of the 6th, the gas and hot water were switched off. The gas was cut off for a second time on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane claims they were offered no explanation for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just find it incredibly odd that it was switched off twice when we were there,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a text message from the U.S. Embassy on March 7th, the last night of their trip, that really unnerved Jane and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the text message urged them to call ‘ASAP.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A male friend of Jane's called and was told that it was in ‘their best interest to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay for the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Embassy official didn’t elaborate any further, according to Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane and her group returned to the hotel to find several individuals wearing suits standing in the lobby of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the individuals, who Jane believes was Royal Kahal’s general manager, informed them the hotel would be shutting down for the week - but they had the option to stay for their final night if they felt safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fresh off a sunset cruise and with nowhere else to go at such short notice, Jane and her friends reluctantly stayed and flew back to the U.S. the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends called the U.S. Embassy after returning home and was allegedly informed that several of the hotel’s rooms were found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is so frightening because, I mean, this is happening within days of three people dying,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When that happened, they should have closed the hotel immediately. We never should’ve been allowed to stay there, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They fed us all this bulls**t about it being safe, but they didn’t even know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I want to make sure that hotel never opens its doors again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A second autopsy is currently being carried out on each of the women back in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Royal Kahal Beach Resort is a luxury hotel on Ambergris Caye, located in San Pedro, Belize (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar's remains were transported back to the U.S. earlier this month, where a second autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in their home state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The examinations are not expected to be completed for another month. However, a source close to one of the girls’ families told DailyMail.com earlier this week that a preliminary report indicated signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source further stated that investigators have discovered other non-fatal incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Royal Kahal and have made contact with at least one other American victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Royal Kahal, Belize Commissioner Williams, and Belize Fire Chief Colin Gillett have all been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gillett previously told Belizean media that carbon monoxide poisoning had been ruled out following an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson representing the families of Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar declined to comment, sharing only that the bereaved were eagerly awaiting the results of the state Medical Examiner’s second autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Massachusetts confirmed they have custody of the women’s remains but declined to share further details, with a spokesperson saying only that the 'cause and manner of death for the descendents remains pending.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Monday, the women’s families shared their first public statements about their deaths, calling them mysterious and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is with unimaginable pain and heartbreak that we share the devastating news of the passing of Kaoutar Naqqad, Imane Mallah, Wafae El Arar, each a beloved light in the world lost too soon,’ began the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families and all who loved these women are shattered, struggling to comprehend this profound and sudden loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An individual tribute was then paid to each of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallah was remembered as a ‘beacon of kindness’ who ‘embraced life wholeheartedly’; Naqqad was the light of her family’s life ‘whose kindness and warmth touched everyone she met’; and El Arar was ‘honest, kind, and deeply devoted to the people she loved’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their families added: ‘The circumstances surrounding this tragedy remain unclear and suspicious, and we are seeking answers to understand what happened in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We urge the authorities in Belize and in the United States to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation so that we may find the truth and justice for Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received during this heartbreaking time. We ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this profound sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace.

The gas was cut off for a second time on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane claims they were offered no explanation for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just find it incredibly odd that it was switched off twice when we were there,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a text message from the U.S. Embassy on March 7th, the last night of their trip, that really unnerved Jane and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the text message urged them to call ‘ASAP.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A male friend of Jane's called and was told that it was in ‘their best interest to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay for the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Embassy official didn’t elaborate any further, according to Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane and her group returned to the hotel to find several individuals wearing suits standing in the lobby of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the individuals, who Jane believes was Royal Kahal’s general manager, informed them the hotel would be shutting down for the week - but they had the option to stay for their final night if they felt safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fresh off a sunset cruise and with nowhere else to go at such short notice, Jane and her friends reluctantly stayed and flew back to the U.S. the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends called the U.S. Embassy after returning home and was allegedly informed that several of the hotel’s rooms were found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is so frightening because, I mean, this is happening within days of three people dying,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When that happened, they should have closed the hotel immediately. We never should’ve been allowed to stay there, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They fed us all this bulls**t about it being safe, but they didn’t even know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I want to make sure that hotel never opens its doors again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A second autopsy is currently being carried out on each of the women back in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Royal Kahal Beach Resort is a luxury hotel on Ambergris Caye, located in San Pedro, Belize (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar's remains were transported back to the U.S. earlier this month, where a second autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in their home state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The examinations are not expected to be completed for another month. However, a source close to one of the girls’ families told DailyMail.com earlier this week that a preliminary report indicated signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source further stated that investigators have discovered other non-fatal incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Royal Kahal and have made contact with at least one other American victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Royal Kahal, Belize Commissioner Williams, and Belize Fire Chief Colin Gillett have all been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gillett previously told Belizean media that carbon monoxide poisoning had been ruled out following an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson representing the families of Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar declined to comment, sharing only that the bereaved were eagerly awaiting the results of the state Medical Examiner’s second autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Massachusetts confirmed they have custody of the women’s remains but declined to share further details, with a spokesperson saying only that the 'cause and manner of death for the descendents remains pending.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Monday, the women’s families shared their first public statements about their deaths, calling them mysterious and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is with unimaginable pain and heartbreak that we share the devastating news of the passing of Kaoutar Naqqad, Imane Mallah, Wafae El Arar, each a beloved light in the world lost too soon,’ began the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families and all who loved these women are shattered, struggling to comprehend this profound and sudden loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An individual tribute was then paid to each of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallah was remembered as a ‘beacon of kindness’ who ‘embraced life wholeheartedly’; Naqqad was the light of her family’s life ‘whose kindness and warmth touched everyone she met’; and El Arar was ‘honest, kind, and deeply devoted to the people she loved’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their families added: ‘The circumstances surrounding this tragedy remain unclear and suspicious, and we are seeking answers to understand what happened in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We urge the authorities in Belize and in the United States to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation so that we may find the truth and justice for Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received during this heartbreaking time. We ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this profound sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace.

Five years ago, at age 46, just as the other big “C” was hitting the United States, I found a lump in my breast. I was reminded of this last month when I had my bi-yearly scans, which showed (thankfully) I’m still cancer-free. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five years is a big deal in cancer terms because if you make it that long without any recurrence, the chances of it coming back drop significantly. When I announced this news to a group of friends, it was met with encouraging sentiments and applause. I was touched but not surprised. I knew that “C” was the one I could talk about; it was the other one I couldn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned this lesson early on, in the spring of 2021, sitting at a barbecue. After surgery and treatments, I had been quarantined in my house for almost a year, and this was one of my first social outings. Perched on an outdoor sofa, I listened to two women beside me talk about how the virus had affected their children’s sports schedules and how boring their social lives had been during the last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Enough is enough,” one of them said with so much conviction you’d think she was a lawyer trying a case. “The whole thing was a bunch of bullshit!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I excused myself, went to the bathroom, sat on a closed toilet seat, and cried. Had we just had the same year? It felt like they must have been living in some kind of parallel universe. Did they not understand what it was like in the hospital? How could they want to just go on with their lives without at least acknowledging the depth of what had just happened to the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memories from those early days of COVID haunted me: the sidewalk outside the hospital where I sobbed as I hugged my husband goodbye on the day of my surgery. The terror in every set of eyes I met once inside. The empty hallways. The workers in full PPE. The way the nurses would do their best &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to touch me. The patient who was rolled past me in a hospital bed with a plastic hood over his head. The caution tape. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the doctor said, “If you get the virus, we won’t be able to treat you.” How I scrubbed my skin raw each time I returned home. How I laid awake night after night, wondering if tomorrow would be the day I’d catch the virus and die. How I needed a good mask, but there were none to buy and watched protesters on the news raging against having to wear one at all. How the government said not to panic, but more people got sick and died. And how the president said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZgJZgFZbU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="“Just stay calm.

The consensus seemed to be that we, as a society, needed to move on from COVID as fast as possible without looking back — no time for reflection, no time for empathy, no time for remembrance. And for the most part, we did just that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were indications this may not have been the best plan — after the pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cases of depression and anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d325d0e4b0e72dd7fee7df" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cases of depression and anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; rose significantly.

This thing that happened was in my DNA now whether I wanted it to be or not. And although I could see the attraction to put the blinders on, I just couldn’t seem to keep them up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The empty hospital where the author received treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It started with anxiety attacks in crowded places. It moved on to ruminating over the slightest changes in my body — a tickle in my throat, a headache, a sneeze. The COVID and the cancer were enmeshed in my mind, so much so that a part of me believed if I succumbed to the first, the other would surely follow. My thoughts, which before the pandemic, had been filled with things like work assignments, my own kid’s game schedules and social plans, were overtaken by an all-consuming fear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when friends asked, “How are you doing?” I always replied, “Good,” because that is what I should’ve been, even if I wasn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logic told me if I acted like the person I was in March of 2020, I would become her again. So, I said yes when I got invitations, even though I wanted to say no. I smiled through cocktail parties and work events. I told myself: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is what people do, and the more you do it, the easier it will get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I took the subway, went to the theater, traveled, and said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If all these other people are doing it, it must be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even when, amid those things, I did get a mild case of COVID and recovered, the anxiety remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The aftermath of a traumatic event can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and problems with emotional regulation (such as irritability and anger). I was experiencing almost all of those things and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew I couldn’t suppress them any longer, so I began therapy. Week after week, I told my story, and as I did, the worry finally began to fade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned that a common coping mechanism when people experience trauma is a detachment from thoughts and feelings. And as I grasped how this was true in relation to myself, I started to wonder: Is that what we, as a society, have done as well? After enduring one period of isolation, did we forgo grieving collectively in the aftermath to avoid feeling things that were too hard to hold? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, I live very much the way I did before COVID and cancer, but at times, I still feel my body tensing around crowds and unpredictable situations. And although I now have the tools to manage these moments, I wonder if they will ever go away. Just as having cancer has forever changed me, COVID did, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am not the same person I was before March of 2020, and neither are you. Whether we like it or not, we have all been changed by the other big “C.” Our COVID stories matter — whether they be from a first grader who missed their little league season, a teenager who had to do school online from the confines of their bedroom, a frontline worker, a grandparent who went a year without a hug, a once healthy adult who now suffers from long COVID, or one of the millions of people who lost a loved one. These experiences shaped us into the people we are today, they are a part of us now. To say those truths out loud is to know we were never alone, even when we were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping well is vital for energy and good health — but getting the right amount of different stages of sleep can make all the difference. Among the various sleep stages, two of the most well-known are REM sleep and deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is closely associated with cognition and emotions (not to mention vivid dreams). Meanwhile, deep sleep is crucial for immune function, physical restoration, and general well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need different amounts of each, and cycling through all of the sleep stages, including light sleep (also known as NREM 1 and NREM 2) is important to wake up feeling your best and promote good health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, we’re diving into all things REM sleep vs deep sleep for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-awareness-week-2025" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-awareness-week-2025"&gt;Sleep Awareness Week 2025&lt;/a&gt; — including what happens during each stage, when they occur, how much of each we need. Plus, we'll offer our top tips on how to get more of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-rem-sleep-3"&gt;What is REM sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is a stage of sleep defined by rapid eye movement. Per a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219315155" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219315155" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020 review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, REM sleep “is a behavioral state, a brain state, a dream state, and a paradoxical state,” which highlights its status as perhaps the most unique sleep stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s typically classified as its own category compared to NREM sleep (aka non-REM sleep), the latter of which has three stages that include light sleep and deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During REM sleep, your brain is almost as active as when you’re awake, says &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.doctorrajd.com/" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.doctorrajd.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Raj Dasgupta, MD, FACP, FCCP, FAASM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical advisor for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sleepopolis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a quadruple board certified physician in internal medicine, pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-deep-sleep-3"&gt;What is deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep is also known as slow-wave sleep, as your brain waves notably slow down to prompt significant rest and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deep sleep is the most physically restorative stage,” says Dr Dasgupta, underscoring its importance to not only help you wake up feeling refreshed but also support overall health and vitality over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Since it’s such a deep state, waking up from it can leave you feeling groggy,” he adds. Moreover, if you don’t get enough deep sleep, you may feel foggy and fatigued the next day — even if you logged the requisite &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need"&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 to 9 hours of sleep per night&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that most adults need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-what-do-they-both-do"&gt;&lt;span&gt;REM sleep vs Deep sleep: What do they both do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stages are equally as important for us to wake up feeling rested and restored, ready for another day ahead. However, each take on very different roles to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-rem-sleep-3"&gt;The role of REM sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“REM sleep is when most vivid dreaming happens,” says Dr Dasgupta. “Your voluntary muscles stay paralyzed so you don’t act out dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: You can dream during other stages of sleep, but those dreams may be more fragmented and easier to forget upon waking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“REM sleep is key for memory, learning, and emotional processing,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-deep-sleep-3"&gt;The role of deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep — also called the N3 stage of NREM sleep — is arguably the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-many-sleep-stages-are-there-and-which-is-the-best" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-many-sleep-stages-are-there-and-which-is-the-best"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most important sleep stage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During deep sleep, your brain waves slow way down, your body repairs itself, and your immune system gets a boost,” Dr Dasgupta shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is also when growth hormones are released,” he adds. This means deep sleep is essential for physical recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-when-do-they-occur"&gt;&lt;span&gt;REM sleep vs Deep sleep: When do they occur?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cycle through different sleep stages throughout the night, with REM sleep occurring about 90 minutes after you fall asleep,” Dr Dasgupta explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first REM period is usually short, while subsequent REM stages gradually lengthen as you approach the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your first REM stage may be only a few minutes in length while the final REM stage &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;can last up to an hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, deep sleep happens mostly in the first half of the night, says Dr Dasgupta. Since we need enough deep sleep to feel rested — not to mention facilitate major repair and restoration of the brain and body — it makes sense we 'bank' it as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-how-much-do-we-need"&gt;&lt;span&gt; REM sleep vs Deep sleep: How much do we need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-rem-sleep-do-we-need-3"&gt;How much REM sleep do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, REM typically accounts for around 25% of all sleep, or about 90 to 120 minutes per night. However, this requirement varies on a range of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Age, genetics, stress levels, and lifestyle all play a role,” Dr Dasgupta shares, each of which will dictate whether you need more or less REM sleep to feel and function your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep habits, alcohol, and an inconsistent schedule can throw things off, making it harder to get the right balance of sleep stages,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-deep-sleep-do-we-need-3"&gt;How much deep sleep do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might sound surprising due to deep sleep’s major influence on restoration, immunity, and brain health, but we actually need less of this sleep stage compared to REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most adults need about 1 to 2 hours of deep sleep per night,” says Dr Dasgupta, “but this isn’t an exact science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, deep sleep decreases with age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the ideal amount of deep sleep for you — as well as how much you’ll typically get — will vary on a host of factors such as your age, health conditions, medications, and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, deep sleep decreases with age,” he adds, so you naturally might log less of it in older adulthood than you did in your 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up, with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841578/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841578/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; that deep sleep (among other elements of sleep architecture) decreased up until the age of 60, when it appeared to plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-rem-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more REM sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can’t exactly train yourself to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep"&gt;get more REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are a number of lifestyle tips and tricks you can adopt to achieve more high-quality sleep on the whole, and thus increase likelihood of getting more REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="keep-a-regular-sleep-schedule-3"&gt;Keep a regular sleep schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want better sleep, consistency is key,” says Dr Dasgupta. As such, sticking to a regular sleep schedule is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it may be to cave into a late-night TV binging session or sleep in when you get the chance, inconsistent sleep and wake times are one of the biggest instigators getting in the way of solid rest each and every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Waking up at the same time each morning — even if you had a poor night’s rest prior — is wise since it’ll encourage sleepiness come bedtime, thus helping you bounce back to your regular sleeping window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoid-caffeine-and-alcohol-3"&gt;Avoid caffeine and alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dasgutpa also advises limiting caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evening. However, it’ll be in your best interest scaling back caffeine earlier in the day — with research suggesting at least &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 hours before bedtime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to avoid sleep disruptions, though this will also vary based on your sensitivity to caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount will also impact your REM sleep. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024173/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024173/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of healthy men published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biological Rhythms&lt;/em&gt; in 2021 found that participants who had 150 milligrams of caffeine three times daily over 10 days experienced delays in REM sleep, as well as greater difficulty waking up and feeling sleepy when they did, compared to a group that underwent caffeine withdrawal, and a placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, alcohol &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/healthu/2023/06/14/heres-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/healthu/2023/06/14/heres-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduces the amount of REM sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you get — not to mention contributes to nighttime awakenings and lowers your overall sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="manage-stress-and-anxiety-3"&gt;Manage stress and anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and anxiety are likely to get in the way of achieving a good night’s rest and a healthy balance of sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that when experimental stressors were applied in studies, REM sleep, deep sleep and sleep efficiency were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that major stressors may increase REM sleep but reduce deep sleep. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3317042/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3317042/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;REM rebound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is when we spend more time in REM sleep, may help mental recovery; however, losing deep sleep in the process will be disadvantageous for your energy levels, physical restoration, and long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Dr Dasgupta advises managing stress through your preferred relaxation techniques — be it reading, meditating, listening to music, doing gentle yoga, or another method — if worry and rumination lead you to have trouble falling asleep or feel poorly rested upon waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-deep-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more deep sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the case with REM sleep, you can’t will yourself to boost the amount of deep sleep you get every night.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list takeaway-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown fat, unlike white fat, burns calories and can boost exercise performance by improving blood flow to muscles during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mice with enhanced brown fat lived 20% longer and showed 30% better exercise performance, with the benefits transferable through tissue transplantation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rutgers researchers are developing a drug that could activate brown fat in humans, potentially helping people maintain physical fitness as they age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. —&lt;/strong&gt; The next breakthrough in anti-aging medicine might come from a surprising source: fat. But not just any fat—brown fat, a special type that burns energy rather than storing it. Researchers at Rutgers University are developing a pill that could boost this beneficial tissue’s activity, after discovering its remarkable effects on exercise capacity and lifespan in mice. Their work suggests that activating brown fat could be the key to staying physically fit as we age, with a drug potentially available for testing within a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research paper published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/206179/text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brown fat&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just for keeping us warm—it actively contributes to better exercise performance and potentially extends our healthy years. The paper, authored by Dorothy E. Vatner, Jie Zhang, and Stephen F. Vatner from Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, offers a fresh perspective on fat tissue and its surprising connections to exercise capacity and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Exercise capacity diminishes as you get older, and to have a technique that could enhance exercise performance would be very beneficial for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthful aging&lt;/a&gt;,” said Stephen Vatner, university professor and director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute in the medical school’s Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine and senior author of the study, in a statement. “This mouse model performs exercise better than their normal littermates.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-fat-is-created-equal"&gt;Not All Fat Is Created Equal&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people think of fat as something to lose, but brown fat, (also known as brown adipose tissue) &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brown-fat-protects-from-chronic-illnesses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;works differently&lt;/a&gt; from the white fat we typically try to shed. This special tissue burns calories rather than storing them, generating heat through a process called thermogenesis. While scientists have known about brown fat’s heat-producing abilities for decades, the connection between the tissue and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exercise performance&lt;/a&gt; represents a fascinating new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Rutgers team has been studying a particular genetic model—mice lacking a protein called regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14)—that exhibit dramatically &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cutting-calories-slow-cell-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extended lifespans&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced exercise performance. Their research found that these long-lived mice have more potent brown fat, which appears to be directly responsible for their impressive physical abilities and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The color difference between white and brown fat isn’t just cosmetic. Brown fat cells contain numerous mitochondria—cellular power plants that give these cells their distinctive brown color. These mitochondria are packed with a protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which allows them to generate heat instead of the usual cellular energy currency, ATP. This metabolic flexibility makes brown fat uniquely positioned to influence whole-body energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impressive-results-from-brown-fat-transplantation"&gt;Impressive Results From Brown Fat Transplantation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ most compelling evidence comes from transplantation experiments. When they transplanted brown fat from the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice into normal mice, the recipients experienced dramatically enhanced exercise performance within just three days. In contrast, normal mice receiving brown fat transplants from other normal mice also showed improvement—but only after eight weeks. This suggests that the brown fat from the long-lived mice possesses unique properties that can rapidly boost exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists say that the transplanted brown fat increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the legs during exercise, promoting better oxygen and nutrient delivery to working muscles. It also stimulated the formation of new blood vessels and increased the density of existing ones. In essence, the brown fat was helping to build a more efficient circulatory system for delivering fuel during physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice produced unusually high amounts of active brown fat and showed about 30% better exercise performance than normal mice, both in speed and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/muscles-exercise-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;time to exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, several pathways appear to be activated by the enhanced brown fat, including SIRT3 (a longevity-associated protein), MEK/ERK signaling, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These pathways collectively improve mitochondrial function, reduce &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/oxidative-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, and enhance blood flow—all critical factors for exercise performance and potentially for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-better-with-brown-fat"&gt;Aging Better With Brown Fat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection to aging becomes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-cup-of-coffee-activates-calorie-burning-brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;even more apparent&lt;/a&gt; when examining the physical appearance of the genetically modified mice. Normal mice show typical signs of aging—&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/gray-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;graying fur,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hair-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, and general body atrophy—but the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice maintain a more youthful appearance well into old age. Even at advanced ages, they maintain a healthier appearance, avoiding the typical signs of aging that appear in normal elderly mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modified mice live &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/flexibility-key-to-longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;about 20% longer&lt;/a&gt; than normal mice, with females living longer than males – similar to the pattern seen in humans. While the paper doesn’t explore the gender difference in depth, it raises intriguing questions about sex hormones and their potential interaction with brown adipose tissue function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical applications extend far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-home-gyms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the gym&lt;/a&gt;. If brown fat truly has the protective effects suggested by this research, it could become a therapeutic target for preventing or treating a host of age-related conditions. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are all mentioned as potential conditions that might respond to brown fat-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With all the medical advances, aging and longevity have increased in humans, but unfortunately, healthful aging hasn’t,” Vatner said. “There are a lot of diseases associated with aging – obesity, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, cancer – and what we have to do is find new drugs based on models of healthful aging.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-lab-to-real-life"&gt;From Lab to Real Life&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than develop a treatment that addresses aging broadly, which poses regulatory challenges, Vatner said his team plans to test for specific benefits such as improved exercise capacity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This approach builds on their previous success in developing a drug based on a different mouse healthful longevity model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with some people to develop this agent, and hopefully, in another year or so, we’ll have a drug that we can test,” Vatner said. He added that most people would prefer to increase brown fat levels by taking pills rather than ice baths and is optimistic about translating the newest finding into an effective medication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wondering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/off-switch-brown-fat-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how to activate&lt;/a&gt; their own brown fat now, current science suggests that cold exposure is one of the most effective natural stimulants. When we’re cold, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, which binds to receptors on brown fat cells and activates UCP1-mediated heat production. In the meantime, techniques such as deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat naturally. Studies have found such efforts to produce short-term benefits that range from enhanced immune system function to improved metabolic health, but Vatner said none of the studies have run long enough to find any effect on healthful aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the path from these mouse studies to human applications remains uncertain, but study authors are hopeful that a brown fat-activating drug is in reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically modified mouse lacking the regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14 knockout mice), which they compared to normal mice. To determine if brown fat was responsible for the benefits they observed, the team performed transplantation experiments, surgically moving brown fat from RGS14 KO mice into normal mice, then testing the recipients’ exercise performance on specialized treadmills. They measured hind limb blood flow using imaging techniques and examined tissue samples for signs of new blood vessel formation. The team also analyzed molecular markers to identify the specific cellular pathways involved in the effects of brown fat on exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-and-limitations"&gt;Results and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice lived about 20% longer than normal mice and showed approximately 30% better exercise performance. When brown fat from these mice was transplanted into normal mice, the recipients experienced enhanced exercise capacity within just three days, compared to the eight weeks needed for normal mice receiving brown fat from other normal mice. The improved performance came with increased blood flow to the hind limbs and higher density of blood vessels in the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the study has limitations. Mouse models don’t always translate directly to human physiology, and the transplantation approach isn’t directly applicable as a human intervention. The paper also notes inconsistent findings in the field regarding the effects of exercise on brown fat, suggesting complex relationships that may vary based on intensity, duration, and individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;

It produces butyrate, a sign of gut fermentation that suggests good digestion and nutrient absorption, Segata explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"It’s probably producing short-chain fatty acids, which are supposed to be positive modulators of immunity,” Segata adds. Still, he says that “strong data” is needed to learn more about what this actually does for your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;What he does know is that there’s a solid link between coffee consumption and the presence of &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;. Segata and fellow researchers actually fed coffee to  &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus &lt;/em&gt;that was growing in petri dishes and found it made the bacteria grow faster. “It’s clear that the coffee was stimulating it,” Segata says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This stimulation is possibly due to metabolites in the coffee. Plus, it's “probably not the caffeine, because decaf had a similar effect," Segata adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-get--l-asaccharolyticus-from-other-foods" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get  &lt;em&gt;L.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt; from other foods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As of now, this bacterium is just linked to coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, aronia berries contain chlorogenic acid and polyphenols like coffee, so they may have a similar effect, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danbee Kim" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert, weight loss surgeon, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “Other foods high in chlorogenic acid—such as blueberries, apples, and pears—might also support the growth of this gut bacteria, though more research is needed to confirm this,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-coffee-do-i-need-to-drink-to-reap-the-gut-benefits" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much coffee do I need to drink to reap the gut benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Having a cup or two of coffee a day promotes the growth of &lt;em&gt;L.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;, Segata says. But he points out that “heavy” coffee drinkers, who have three or more coffees a day, have up to 10 times more of the bacteria in their gut compared to people who don’t drink coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-any-negative-impacts-of-coffee-on-gut-health" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any negative impacts of coffee on gut health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few to keep in mind. The biggest potential drawback is that it could raise your risk of acid reflux, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rudolph Bedford" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Rudolph Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“It also increases gastrointestinal mobility and can potentially cause diarrhea,” he says. But, overall, Bedford says that coffee is considered a relatively safe drink for people, provided they don’t overdo it on the caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

They urged New Yorkers not to feed their pets raw food or raw milk and to avoid letting them roam outside where they could encounter wild birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk that bird flu presents to New Yorkers remains low, the health department said. Human-to-human transmission of the avian influenza virus remains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt; and has not occurred during the current outbreak in the United States, which began in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is possible for someone to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-humans.html#:~:text=Other%20animals%20infected%20with%20avian,or%20mouth%2C%20or%20is%20inhaled." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;contract bird&lt;/a&gt; flu from an animal if they come into contact with the animal’s organs, blood or other bodily fluids, including milk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2022, 70 people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. and one has died, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov.

            Three months into 2025, the United States has surpassed the total number of measles cases in the country for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3f2s000d3b6muukucs34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So far in 2025, there have been at least 308 measles cases reported in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024, there were 285 measles cases. The high numbers are driven by a large outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3gdi000i3b6m47ifgdpy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the years since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 measles cases reported each year. There have been an average of about 8 outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But the worst outbreaks each year typically stay under 50 cases. 2025 is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year that an outbreak has led to more than 200 cases. The others were the Disneyland outbreak that started in 2014 and 2019 when a nearly year-long outbreak in New York came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death – a school-aged child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico said last week they are investigating the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles. The Lea County resident had not sought out health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Voepel after three confirmed cases of Hepatitis C (HCV) infections were directly linked to her interventional pain management clinic in Melbourne, Florida. That number has now risen to at least 12 infected patients. The investigation, conducted by the Florida Department of Health, revealed serious infection control failures and widespread medical safety violations at the facility, located at 4015 N. Harbor City Boulevard, Melbourne, FL 32935. Although only three infections have been officially confirmed through genetic testing, health officials warn that many more patients may have been exposed due to unsafe practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article provides a detailed breakdown of the investigation’s findings, the specific violations that led to the outbreak, and the severe risks faced by current and former patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health, in collaboration with local authorities, launched an investigation after identifying a cluster of Hepatitis C cases among patients with no traditional risk factors, all of whom had been treated at Dr. Voepel’s clinic. The report’s findings detail the scope of the exposure, the confirmed infections, and the ongoing risk to hundreds of patients. Here’s a detailed look at the key findings and information provided from victims:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="td-a-ad id_inline_ad1 id_ad_content-horiz-left"&gt;&lt;span class="td-adspot-title"&gt;- Advertisement -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://forms.gle/dNCjQksBSdTo3rHs9"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img/https://thespacecoastrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ADVERTISE-WITH-THE-SPACE-COAST-ROCKET-Canvas-Banner-1000-x-250-px.png"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" data-src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img/https://thespacecoastrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ADVERTISE-WITH-THE-SPACE-COAST-ROCKET-Canvas-Banner-1000-x-250-px.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings from the Official Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health, in coordination with local health authorities, launched an investigation after three patients—identified as Patient H.S., Patient A.H., and Patient H.F.—were diagnosed with a rare strain of Hepatitis C. The only common factor among these patients was that they had all undergone pain management procedures at Dr. Voepel’s clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials conducted an unannounced inspection on March 7, 2025, uncovering extensive violations that posed an immediate threat to public health. Below are the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="td-a-ad id_inline_ad2 id_ad_content-horiz-left"&gt;&lt;span class="td-adspot-title"&gt;- Advertisement -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://myway.glossgenius.com/"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img/https://thespacecoastrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.31.53-PM.png"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" data-src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img/https://thespacecoastrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-9.31.53-PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmed Infections &amp;amp; Potential Exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three patients&lt;/strong&gt; have been confirmed to have Hepatitis C through &lt;strong&gt;molecular testing&lt;/strong&gt; that linked their infections to the clinic. A total of 12 patients have been confirmed since then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exact number of additional &lt;strong&gt;potentially exposed patients remains unknown&lt;/strong&gt; due to &lt;strong&gt;incomplete and inconsistent medical records&lt;/strong&gt;. But information from former staff and other publicly available information estimates that potentially 400 patients may have been exposed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exposure period identified in the report &lt;strong&gt;spans from March 2024 to February 2025&lt;/strong&gt; (not March 2023, as previously believed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infection Control Violations &amp;amp; Dangerous Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Failure to Maintain Proper Sterilization of Medical Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;autoclave machine used for sterilizing surgical instruments&lt;/strong&gt; was &lt;strong&gt;not properly verified&lt;/strong&gt; for effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spore testing, required &lt;strong&gt;every seven days&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure proper sterilization, &lt;strong&gt;was not conducted&lt;/strong&gt; in compliance with CDC guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inspectors found &lt;strong&gt;reusable medical equipment wrapped in discolored, non-sterile gauze&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Reuse of Single-Use Medical Supplies &amp;amp; Improper Needle Disposal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;single-use bag of saline&lt;/strong&gt; was improperly &lt;strong&gt;used for multiple patients&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Used needles&lt;/strong&gt; were found &lt;strong&gt;outside of the sharps disposal container&lt;/strong&gt;, creating a &lt;strong&gt;major contamination hazard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several medication vials were being used as &lt;strong&gt;multi-dose vials&lt;/strong&gt;, but &lt;strong&gt;lacked required labeling&lt;/strong&gt; of open and expiration dates, violating safety protocols.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Expired &amp;amp; Contaminated Medical Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The clinic’s crash cart, meant for emergency life-saving situations, contained expired medications and equipment, including defibrillator pads that expired in July 2024.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The operating room and recovery beds were covered in foam tubing that could not be properly cleaned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patient monitoring electrodes contained visible hair and dirt, raising concerns about cross-contamination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Lack of Hygiene &amp;amp; Handwashing Facilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sink inside the facility was cluttered with items, making proper handwashing impossible for staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No dedicated handwashing station was available for surgical team members to sterilize their hands before procedures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Lack of Risk Management &amp;amp; Oversight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The facility’s Policy and Procedures Manual had not been updated since January 2024, despite requirements for annual review.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No active risk management program was in place, and required quarterly reviews had not been conducted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An unregistered staff member, Lisa Stebben, was found assisting in the operating room without being listed on the clinic’s official registration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate Consequences &amp;amp; License Restriction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 12, 2025, the Florida Department of Health issued an Emergency Restriction Order (ERO) against Dr. Voepel’s medical license, preventing her from:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performing any procedures involving intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acting as the Designated Physician for any registered office surgery facility in Florida.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;state surgeon general cited Dr. Voepel’s failure&lt;/strong&gt; to comply with infection control standards as an &lt;strong&gt;immediate and serious danger&lt;/strong&gt; to public health, warranting swift action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Department Warning: Get Tested Immediately&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge any patient who received treatment at Dr. Voepel’s clinic between March 2024 and February 2025 to get tested for Hepatitis C immediately. The virus can remain asymptomatic for years, making early detection critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ongoing Investigation &amp;amp; Potential Criminal Liability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health is continuing to investigate whether additional patients have been infected and if criminal charges should be pursued against Dr. Voepel. Given the severity of the violations, further disciplinary action beyond the emergency restriction of her license is likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: A Shocking Breach of Medical Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report paint a disturbing picture of negligence and systemic failures at Dr. Voepel’s clinic. Three confirmed Hepatitis C infections and the potential exposure of countless more patients underscore the critical importance of strict infection control in medical practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. Voepel’s license has been restricted, the long-term effects of this outbreak remain unknown, and more patients could still be at risk. This case serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of medical negligence and the need for rigorous oversight to protect public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Patients Should Do Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were treated at Dr. Voepel’s clinic between March 2024 and February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, schedule a &lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis C screening&lt;/strong&gt; with your healthcare provider immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any concerns or symptoms to the Florida Department of Health at (850) 245-4444.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay updated on this case as additional legal actions may follow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a developing story.

Pictured above is virologist Shi Zhengli, known as 'Batwoman' for her work on coronaviruses in Wuhan. Some suggest that the Covid pandemic was triggered by a leak from her laboratory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'To find out more, we plan to conduct experiments in Hong Kong during the current year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MERS is a contagious respiratory illness spread from animals to humans and from human to human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and vomiting, and can be fatal in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two patients in the US have ever tested positive for MERS — both in May 2014 — and each case was linked to travel from the Middle East. There is no vaccine against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worldwide, the virus has triggered 2,613 cases and 943 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the research, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.70173?logout=true"&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took 423 oral and rectal swabs from 15 species of bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab analyses revealed the seven coronavirus strains were genetically different to any known pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The viruses were found in the velvety free-tailed bat and great fruit-eating bat, which both live across South America and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Defending the paper, virologist Dr Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, who was also involved in the research, said: 'Bats are important viral reservoirs and should thereofre be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This monitoring helps identify circulating viruses and risks of transmission to other animals, and even to humans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14421599/coronavirus-potential-cause-pandemic-discovered-china.html"&gt;three weeks&lt;/a&gt; after scientists in China revealed they had discovered yet another coronavirus that could spread to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scenes eerily reminiscent of the beginnings of the Covid pandemic, researchers at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology detected the new strain living within bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is strikingly similar to the pandemic virus, sparking fears that history could repeat itself just two years after the worst was declared over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Update:  since the public meeting of the vaccine advisory committee was cancelled, representatives of the CDC, FDA, and Department of Defense (!) met in closed session to decide to use the WHO selections of which strains to use for this fall's flu vaccines.  So there will be vaccines, RFKJr can take a hike. He probably does less damage when he's away hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traveler came through LAX airport on March 5 in the evening, and is now a confirmed measles case.  They also visited a nail salon and a grocery store while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Europe had  32,265 measles cases, the vast majority of them in Romania. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/la-county-reports-first-measles-case-2025-lax-traveler-cases-confirmed-philadelphia-ny" target="_blank"&gt;More than 27,000 of them&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the great majority were unvaccinated. Ten Europeans died of measles in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-years-pandemic-world-poorly.html" target="_blank"&gt;We aren't ready for the next pandemic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH cancelled dozens of studies into vaccine hesitancy and ways to increase vaccine uptake.  Because they want us to get sick, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/nih-cuts-research-grants-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-vaccine-studies-next-target" target="_blank"&gt;Not enough Rs in GRRRRRRR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The termination letter seen by&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;said their awards "no longer effectuates agency priorities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Michigan counties have now found chronic wasting disease in farmed deer.  It was first noted in wild deer in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings challenge traditional assumptions about exercise and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Jyväskylä examined how long-term physical activity affects mortality and whether it can counteract genetic risks for disease. The team also explored role of exercise in biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts analyzed 22,750 Finnish twins born before 1958. Their leisure-time &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-reduces-the-risk-of-brain-diseases-by-up-to-54-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; was assessed in 1975, 1981, and 1990. The researchers followed up on mortality data through the end of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moderate-activity-yields-maximum-benefits"&gt;Moderate activity yields maximum benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified four activity groups: sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active. Over 30 years, the biggest difference was found between the sedentary and moderately active groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderately active individuals had a 7% lower mortality risk. However, those in the highly active group did not show additional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strength-training-may-be-the-best-exercise-for-insomnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, more physical activity correlated with lower mortality. However, in the long run, highly active individuals had no advantage over those who were sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An underlying pre-disease state can limit physical activity and ultimately lead to death, not the lack of exercise itself,” said Professor Elina Sillanpää from the Faculty of Sports and Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can bias the association between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and mortality in the short term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-guidelines-and-mortality-risk"&gt;Exercise guidelines and mortality risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts also evaluated whether following World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) physical activity guidelines influenced mortality and genetic disease risk. The WHO recommends 150–300 minutes of moderate or 75–150 minutes of vigorous activity weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study showed that meeting these guidelines did not lower mortality risk. Even twins who followed the recommendations for 15 years showed no significant difference in mortality rates compared to their less active siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widely observed favorable association between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and mortality are based on observational studies that are prone to bias from different sources,” noted postdoctoral researcher Laura Joensuu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our studies, we aimed to account for various sources of biases, and combined with the long follow-up period, we could not confirm that adhering to physical activity guidelines mitigates genetic cardiovascular disease risk or causally reduces mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-and-biological-aging"&gt;Exercise and biological aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a subset of twins, the researchers analyzed biological aging using epigenetic clocks. These clocks estimate biological aging based on chemical markers that regulate gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a U-shaped pattern. Both the least and most active individuals experienced accelerated biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the association between leisure-time physical activity and biological aging was U-shaped: Biological aging was accelerated in those who exercised the least and the most,” said Sillanpää.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol use played a major role in the link between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-is-far-more-important-than-weight-for-living-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and biological aging. The study also examined genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease and blood pressure using polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-exercise-does-not-slow-aging"&gt;More exercise does not slow aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research challenges the widely held belief that more exercise always leads to a longer life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical activity is beneficial for overall health, its impact on longevity is more complicated than previously assumed. Moderate exercise appears to offer the best balance, while excessive activity does not necessarily add extra years to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also highlight the importance of considering other factors, such as lifestyle habits and genetic predisposition. Exercise alone may not be enough to overcome genetic risks. Other aspects of health, such as diet, stress management, and avoiding harmful habits, play a crucial role in aging and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may further clarify the relationship between physical activity and lifespan. In the meantime, individuals should aim for a balanced approach to exercise, focusing on overall well-being rather than just lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved researchers from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences and the Methodology Centre for Human Sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Jyväskylä&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans and other multicellular organisms, cells multiply. This defining feature allows embryos to grow into adulthood, and enables the healing of the many bumps, bruises and scrapes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Certain factors can cause cells to abandon this characteristic and enter a zombie-like state known as senescence where they persist but no longer divide to make new cells. Our bodies can remove these senescent cells that tend to pile up as we age. The older we get, however, the less efficient our immune systems become at doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to no longer growing and proliferating, the other hallmark of senescent cells is that they have this inflammatory program causing them to secrete inflammatory molecules," said Peter Adams, Ph.D., director and professor of the Cancer Genome and Epigenetics Program at Sanford Burnham Prebys and senior and co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells "running" this inflammatory program are considered to exhibit the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Too many cells with SASP secreting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+molecules/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+inflammation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body. This pervasive inflammation—called "inflammaging"—has been linked to many age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and collaborators across the country published findings in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57229-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing that the mitochondria powering our cells also control the ability of a DNA repair protein to suppress SASP, which may reduce or delay inflammaging.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The research team turned human cells senescent by exposing them to radiation and then used those cells to demonstrate that DNA fixer tumor protein p53 suppressed SASP and one of its triggering events, the formation of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fragments are bits of damaged DNA that have been spewed from the cells' nuclei into the gel-like cytoplasm that occupies the space in the cell between the outer membrane and central nucleus. The presence of DNA where it does not belong can trigger the immune system and contribute to SASP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists validated their findings in mice by treating them with a drug developed by cancer researchers to activate p53 as a way of suppressing tumors. In aged mice, the drug did not reduce the number of senescent cells but instead reversed the cellular signature that marks age-associated SASP, potentially stopping the inflammatory pollution that can lead to inflammaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the investigators discovered that senescent cells suffer from dysfunction in the mitochondria, serving as cells' primary source of energy. Stressed mitochondria can cause senescent cells to form CCF and dampen the expression of the gene carrying the blueprint for p53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Altogether, we've identified a cellular circuit capable of promoting DNA repair and genome integrity while suppressing the dangerous inflammatory feature of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/senescent+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;senescent cells&lt;/a&gt; that contribute to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/age-related+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;age-related diseases&lt;/a&gt;," said Karl Miller, Ph.D., staff scientist in the Adams lab at Sanford Burnham Prebys and lead and co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also have shown that this pathway can be modified by existing drugs in cultured cells and mice, so it may be possible to one day design a treatment that targets p53 to promote healthier aging."&lt;/p&gt;

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at £250 a month. He told us then that he felt "very fortunate" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that "it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone "off patent" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Each year, NHS England can make "discretionary" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at "the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes", and ministers would not intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Turner said he was "stunned" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has spent £20,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS £77 per pack per month - could not be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 14:30:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBsUXRGVy14Sk5jWkhic2xfQUMtN0Jfd2xSRW80aXRpeVFpM0RXVGZ4eHBXZmhBMHB3R3lwck5mWVFJcmZpVVFYYXNoMnBTdUZyRzFYbTJlNEFJd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1va2lJQi1mNG5ySU4tNEhXMUQ5eFlQeXlEQ05CSHpQVzVhaDI0QkFtSXVtcW1Bc21kYjVxRFF4S3V2eVBZWmNwbTgzRl85Vmgxb2lTM3ZEWTlMVThfdVk0</guid></item><item><title>Tragedy Story After After Doctors Send 10-Year-Old Maryland Girl Home From the Hospital - The Root</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNZlEwLXM0YTRxWWpPN1NUcjZxYjgtWDhuMU1xTDBQYkZ5U2VwT3pYM1htVjJsZ19SRjNJSHp6N3dtUmJmTjNOYmF6dnVianFDOTBMeG9GZmxDMHhrM256czZXOHVzLXRuWnZIR2pFZ2g3c1pBbnlZSnU5eVFJQmxWVzhBTzJtN29EazktTzNjUExiYTVh?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-r43lxo-1 cwnrYD"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;A Maryland family is mourning the&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kMzRIQ js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://www.theroot.com/the-nj-school-bus-aide-who-let-a-disabled-child-choke-t-1851769391",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.theroot.com/the-nj-school-bus-aide-who-let-a-disabled-child-choke-t-1851769391"&gt; tragic loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of a ten-year-old girl who they describe as the family’s light.

The longer-term &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/addiction-heavy-drinking"&gt;physical consequences of abusing alcohol&lt;/a&gt; — liver damage, jaundice, and cancer — have long been impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So why, in that case, has there been a widespread belief, even among many physicians, that moderate drinking might actually be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We can thank the so-called French paradox for this. In the early 1990s, French scientist &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51361649_Serge_Renaud_from_French_paradox_to_Cretan_miracle"&gt;Serge Renaud concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the French had low rates of cardiovascular disease despite their affinity for fatty foods like beef and cheese because they otherwise adhere to a healthy &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; — and because they consumed “moderate” amounts of red wine. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281#:~:text=Resveratrol%20in%20red%20wine,More%20research%20is%20needed."&gt;theorized that the antioxidants in red wine&lt;/a&gt; could play a role in reducing cholesterol, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Subsequent studies appeared to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193755"&gt;affirm the correlation&lt;/a&gt;, strengthening the belief among the general public about the benefits of red wine. But over the past decade, new studies and &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155"&gt;public health warnings&lt;/a&gt; have called that conventional wisdom into question, stating emphatically that no level of alcohol consumption could be considered safe — much less beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Alcohol after all, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health"&gt;absolutely is a toxin&lt;/a&gt;, and has long been recognized by experts, if not the broader public, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html"&gt;as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Since many people enjoy alcohol to some extent, says Timothy Naimi, director of the University of Victoria’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, “there’s been a far more relaxed scientific standard.” “We all love studies that show, ‘oh, sex makes us live longer, or coffee is good for us, or chocolate is good for us.’ There is this irresistible idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Science has clearly established that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html"&gt;excessive drinking is bad for you&lt;/a&gt;. But what remains confusing, especially with the steady stream of new studies that sometimes seem to contradict each other, is how bad moderate drinking is — and what “moderate” even means. Here’s what we actually know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="moderate-drinking-is-elusive-and-its-very-easy-to-drink-too-much" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Moderate” drinking is elusive — and it’s very easy to drink too much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the most important things to understand about drinking and its health effects is what amount of alcohol is actually considered to be excessive. It is &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/is-it-time-to-rethink-how-much-you-drink"&gt;a common trope&lt;/a&gt; among doctors and alcohol researchers that people misunderstand what moderate drinking means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“None of us like to think of ourselves as drinking to excess, right?” Naimi said. “Who among us wants to think of ourselves as immoderate? Of course, we’re all moderate drinkers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Diners in Paris.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Corbis/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even if we agree in colloquial terms that “one drink a night” is moderate, the details matter. Medical science has far more &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2024/12/americas-most-common-drug-problem-unhealthy-alcohol-use"&gt;precise definitions for what constitutes a “drink”&lt;/a&gt; than the average person pouring themselves a glass of Chablis. One 12-ounce can of 5-percent alcohol beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine with 12-percent alcohol, or a 1.5-ounce glass of 80-proof liquor are all what constitutes a “standard drink.” So when we pour an extra-large glass of wine at night, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; may consider it only one drink, but a doctor sees two or even three. The kind of beer or wine matters too: Your favorite 9 percent IPA is actually closer to two drinks than it is to one, according to medical definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People today are considered by the medical establishment to be heavy drinkers if, by these definitions, they consume more than 15 drinks in a week for men or more than eight drinks for women. (You are considered to have &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt; if you have tried to stop drinking in the past year but failed, have alcohol cravings, or believe drinking interferes with your life. It’s less about specific amounts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below that threshold, based on these scientific standards, you might consider yourself to be a so-called moderate drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This reflects a lot of progress in our understanding of problematic drinking. For centuries, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-conflicted-history-of-alcohol-in-western-civilization/"&gt;people have known that excessive drinking&lt;/a&gt; could damage the liver, cause long-term health problems, and lead to alcohol dependence. The US temperance movement of the 1800s and early 1900s sought to eradicate those personal and social harms and briefly succeeded in outlawing alcohol during the Prohibition era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, as the failure of Prohibition attests, drinking is deeply embedded in our society. Some popular historians like to say that &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/alcohol-caffeine-created-civilization"&gt;alcohol (along with caffeine) helped define human civilization&lt;/a&gt;. There may even be &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(24)00240-4"&gt;an evolutionary angle&lt;/a&gt;: Many animals consume alcohol (called ethanol when it is encountered naturally). Perhaps it’s because finding fruit with some fermented ethanol means you’re good at finding fruit, period — a natural advantage for survival. That is how deeply rooted our ancestral relationship to alcohol might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even today, one of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4211338/"&gt;scheduled around drinking&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;let’s go to happy hour&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;grab some drinks for the big game&lt;/em&gt;, for example. Given the seemingly implacability of social drinking, the focus for a long time has been trying to reduce the kind of habitual, excessive drinking that we have historically called alcoholism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And there was some progress made: Americans collectively report &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/03/10-facts-about-americans-and-alcohol-as-dry-january-begins/sr_2024-01-03_dry-january_05-png/"&gt;consuming less alcohol than they did&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s and ’80s. Today, an estimated 10 percent of Americans 12 and older are &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; as having alcohol use disorder, a number that has stayed fairly stable over the past decade. There is even evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/03/10-facts-about-americans-and-alcohol-as-dry-january-begins/sr_2024-01-03_dry-january_03-png/"&gt;younger people are drinking &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than millennials or Gen X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, however, alcohol-related deaths have been increasing, rising by &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-the-latest-alcohol-death-data-and-change-over-the-last-decade/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; from 2012 to 2022, even with a definition of alcohol-related deaths that is limited to liver disease, poisoning and accidents. The actual count, when considering deaths to which alcohol was at least a contributor, such as cancer in heavy drinkers, is more difficult to quantify but likely much higher. A 2024 estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the number at &lt;a href="/the-highlight/2023/11/6/23931877/alcohol-use-disorder-leading-cause-deaths-medication-therapy"&gt;178,000 deaths attributable to alcohol overuse&lt;/a&gt; annually in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These seemingly contradictory trends — stable rates of alcoholism, but increasing deaths — could be explained by a few things. For one, alcohol use disorder is likely underdiagnosed. Second, “heavy” drinkers may not be alcoholics, but they can still feel the negative health effects of their alcohol use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And then there is an issue that has been worrying doctors for years: &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/binge-drinking"&gt;binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;, usually defined as consuming four (for women) or five (for men) drinks in two hours or less. You may not necessarily be considered an alcoholic if you binge-drink; you may not even be a heavy drinker much of the time. But even more limited episodes of such intense drinking can do serious damages; the immediate risk is death from an accident or alcohol poisoning, but repeated binge drinking raises the risk of longer-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Put it all together and what’s become clear is that more people’s health is being put at risk by their alcohol use than was previously realized. And that means even people whose drinking is considered socially acceptable need to be aware of the threats it poses to their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="is-any-level-of-drinking-safe-or-even-beneficial" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Is any level of drinking safe or even beneficial?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Once you are having more than two drinks a day if you’re a man or one drink a day if you’re a woman, pretty much every researcher agrees that the health risks warrant trying to cut back. But the consensus fractures below that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If we imagine the conversation about alcohol’s health effects as a football field, the consensus covers 95 yards of the 100-yard field — almost all the way to the goal of general unanimity. We all agree heavy drinking is bad, but the fight remains on the issue — the remaining five yards — of whether &lt;em&gt;light &lt;/em&gt;drinking is truly bad and that is still being debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a quarter century after that conventional wisdom about red wine benefitting the human heart really took hold, a growing number of public health organizations and researchers started to aggressively dispute the idea that moderate alcohol consumption could be “safe” or beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“All of the arguing in the past 20 years has been around the health effects of very, very small amounts of alcohol,” Naimi said. “But I don’t think that other than small amounts of alcohol, there’s any question that alcohol consumption is a leading and preventable cause of health and social problems in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;One of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is scheduled around drinking.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One watershed moment was a 2017 publication from the American Society of Clinical Oncology that established that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112463/"&gt;even modest drinking could increase a person’s risk of developing cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The ASCO was alarmed by surveys that found only one in three Americans knew about the finding decades after medical literature had documented a link between, for example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3574368/"&gt;alcohol use and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And with its report, the group aimed to increase awareness among the public that alcohol is a carcinogen and advocate for specific policy strategies to try to reduce excessive alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5440363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, also published in 2017, examined prior research alleging positive cardiovascular effects from moderate alcohol consumption. This analysis, which Naimi co-authored, found possible statistical errors and other countervailing factors in the earlier studies that appeared to support the French paradox’s framework. For example, moderate wine drinkers tend to be more moderate in general, more active, and in better overall health — all of which could help explain their better health outcomes, without alcohol factoring into it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, some of the apparent abstainers studied in the various observational studies of alcohol use and health outcomes &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.15433#:~:text=The%20present%20research%20reaffirms%20previous,an%20alcohol%2Drelated%20health%20condition."&gt;may be former drinkers&lt;/a&gt; who could still feel the health effects years later, which would explain the finding that some moderate drinkers live longer than both non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. More recent studies with more rigorous statistical randomization reported that “alcohol consumption of all amounts was associated with increased cardiovascular risk,” with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/"&gt;risk increasing with every drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 2022, the World Health Organization took an even stronger position, stating that “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health#:~:text=The%20risks%20and%20harms%20associated,that%20does%20not%20affect%20health."&gt;no level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health&lt;/a&gt;” based on available evidence. As they put it, one’s risk appears to increase “from the first drop.” The board of scientists who advise the US government on diet guidelines, too, has advised that the guidance reduce the maximum recommended drinks for men from two to one daily, for example.

Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218856/"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that adhering to certain patterns — such as spacing your weekly allotment of drinks out over a few days and consuming them with a meal — may be beneficial.

We are mostly relying on observational data, not randomized controlled experiments, which could be compromised by all kinds of confounding factors. In an ideal world, you could compare two groups of people who are alike, except one drinks and the other doesn’t, for life. But in practice, that’s very difficult to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixj _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="industry-influence-has-shaped-our-ideas-about-alcohol-consumption" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry influence has shaped our ideas about alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our ability to make sense of all of the confusing science around drinking is further complicated by the influence of the alcohol industry, which airs advertising campaigns with messages like “drink responsibly” that reinforce the idea that a certain level of drinking can be responsible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;The industry also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/24/alcohol-tax-increases-stymied-by-industry-lobbyists-campaign-contributions/"&gt;lobbies lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to stymie any attempt to place new restrictions, requirements or taxes on them. One attempt to stand up a randomized alcohol study, which was to be overseen by Kenneth Mukamal of Harvard, was &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-end-funding-moderate-alcohol-cardiovascular-health-trial"&gt;shut down in 2018 because the alcohol industry&lt;/a&gt; had provided improper input on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of the researchers I spoke to acknowledged the challenge in substantiating alcohol’s effects, positive or negative, but again: Alcohol is a carcinogen; no one needs a randomized control trial to know that, it’s been the international consensus for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a reckoning with alcohol right now, which can leave people feeling unmoored.

Don’t pour too much wine in that glass. Maybe skip the 10 percent double IPA. In my own life, I have moderated my drinking by limiting myself to at most two nights per week and at most two drinks per night. I still get to enjoy my coveted Cabernet once in a while, but having some loose rules for myself has made it easier to reduce my intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The people who have one drink with dinner or two drinks with dinner, I think it’s exactly the right way to do it; that’s the right way to calibrate it,” Kenneth Mukamal, a Harvard doctor who authored several of the studies finding some cardiovascular benefits to moderate alcohol consumption, said. “You should have it with food. You should have it with friends and have it in a way that you’re naturally limited in how much you’re going to drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is also getting easier — and less awkward — to not drink at all if that’s your preference or you simply want to make a change.

&lt;p&gt;Although patients’ motor symptoms eased immediately after the three-month program, there didn’t appear to be a long-term effect on motor symptom severity, emphasizing a need for longer programs and/or further resources to help patients more effectively exercise on their own, the study’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2025.107777"&gt;Effect of an adapted physical activity program in Parkinson’s disease: A randomized controlled study (APA-Park)&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Parkinsonism and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/regular-exercise-eases-parkinsons-motor-symptoms-fatigue/"&gt;exercise can ease motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, yet Parkinson’s patients often struggle with exercising regularly. Physical limitations brought on by the disease can make some types of exercise difficult or impossible, and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like depression can interfere with motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapted physical activity, or APA, is a type of exercise program done under the supervision of a professional trainer who helps to tailor an exercise regimen to the person’s abilities, offering adjustments where needed. While APA might be more useful than unstructured exercise for Parkinson’s patients, there is limited data on its use in this population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Structured program vs free activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists in France conducted a study (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02816619?term=NCT02816619&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;NCT02816619&lt;/a&gt;) to explore the effects of APA in Parkinson’s, enrolling 44 participants with the condition. Half of them underwent a three-month APA program with one-hour sessions twice weekly, and the other half were instructed to freely practice physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of a three-month APA program combining moderate-intensity endurance training, muscle strengthening, and stretching on motor symptoms, body composition, heart and lung (cardiorespiratory) function and metabolic profiles in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardized assessments after three months showed that motor symptoms tended to ease slightly in patients who underwent APA, as shown by a statistically significant decrease in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 3 scores, which evaluate motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, patients who freely exercised experienced a worsening of motor symptoms. This distinction was consistent even after accounting for factors like treatments, disease duration, and the severity of motor symptoms before the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this randomized controlled study, we demonstrated that a 3-month APA program combining moderate-intensity endurance training, muscle reinforcement, and stretching led to a reduction of motor symptom severity immediately after the intervention … while in the same period of time [Parkinson’s] patients assigned to free practice of physical activity presented an increase of motor severity,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a follow-up six months after the APA program ended, however, motor symptom scores were similar for patients who’d done the program and for patients who’d exercised on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From our results, there is an immediate effect on [Parkinson’s] symptoms after the APA program, but no long-term benefit,” the researchers wrote. That suggests “the necessity to either pursue the program in the long run, which raises feasibility issues, or to offer after the initial program some means to help the patient pursue [physical activity] by himself over years, using remote support for example,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of body composition, metabolic profile, and cardiorespiratory function showed no differences between the APA group and the free-exercising group at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the study was limited by its small size, adding that additional research is needed to more fully assess the potential benefits and limitations of APA for Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Criteria may help guide treatment of dermatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have determined that dermatitis resulting from topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is distinct from eczema and is caused by an excess of an essential chemical compound in the body. Scientists from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identified treatments that could be studied in clinical trials for the condition based on their potential to lower levels of the chemical compound—called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), a form of vitamin B3. The findings were published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dermatitis is characterized by inflammation, itching, or burning sensations on the skin, and can result from various conditions including TSW and &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/eczema-atopic-dermatitis"&gt;eczema&lt;/a&gt;. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common cause of dermatitis and affects 10 to 30% of children and 2 to 10% of adults each year in the United States. Topical steroids—specifically glucocorticoids or topical corticosteroids—have long been used as a first-line treatment for dermatitis caused by eczema because the drugs are safe, effective, easy to apply, and considered well-tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people experience dermatitis after using topical steroids for prolonged periods of time and then stopping—a condition called TSW. Diagnosing and treating this condition is difficult because TSW is not well understood. Symptoms include skin redness, burning sensations, skin heat (thermal dysregulation), itching and peeling, which can even occur on parts of the body where topical steroids were not applied. As TSW and eczema have similar symptoms, it has been difficult to distinguish the two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand TSW, a team led by scientists in NIAID’s Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology evaluated a previous survey that included 1,889 adults with symptoms similar to eczema. By dividing the participants into those with self-reported TSW and those without, the researchers identified characteristics unique to TSW. The researchers then conducted a pilot study including 16 people with symptoms consistent with TSW, 10 people with eczema but no symptoms of TSW, and 11 people without skin disease. They found that people with TSW symptoms had elevated levels of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;in their blood serum and skin, while NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were within a typical range in people without TSW symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers subsequently used cultured skin cells and a mouse model to mimic TSW conditions. They found that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was produced in response to topical steroids and caused inflammation. The models suggested that administration of a drug that blocked the formation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;—called a mitochondrial complex I blockade—would improve TSW symptoms. In a pilot study to further assess this treatment strategy, the researchers evaluated subjective responses among study participants who used the mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs metformin, berberine, or both. After three to five months of use, most participants reported improvement in TSW symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists provisionally established criteria that can be used by health care providers to identify TSW in people. People who have stopped topical steroid treatment and meet the criteria may be diagnosed by practitioners as having TSW. The researchers suggest that patients identified as having TSW could be treated using the proposed mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this study may help practitioners identify TSW in patients and work towards developing safe and effective treatments. According to the researchers, more research is needed to determine whether all patients with TSW have an excess of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or if there are other features that define TSW. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria will help health care providers and researchers to better understand the prevalence of TSW and evaluate the effects of using topical steroids.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of their lives, humans and other animals typically learn to avoid situations and stimuli that are dangerous or are perceived as threatening. Past neuroscience studies have gathered evidence suggesting that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region that plays a key role in learning and decision-making, also contributes to these learned threat responses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) recently carried out a study aimed at better understanding how the gradual strengthening of neural connections during the brain's development influences changes in the threat responses of mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01890-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, revealed that there are critical transitions during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain development&lt;/a&gt; that alter how the mPFC interacts with the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two brain regions involved in threat-based and emotional learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study began when we noticed a key gap in our understanding of how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural circuits&lt;/a&gt; in the limbic system—the brain's emotion centers—develop," Laura DeNardo, senior author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "Dysfunction in these systems contributes to anxiety, mood, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt;, which often emerge during adolescence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past psychology research consistently showed that adverse experiences during childhood, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; or traumatic events, can increase the risk of developing various mental health disorders, including substance use, anxiety and mood disorders. Most studies exploring the contribution of early life adversity to these disorders, however, were conducted on adult populations.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"The neurodevelopmental links between early adversity and poor mental health in adolescence and adulthood are thus not well understood, especially at the level of synapses, cells, and circuits," said DeNardo. "To understand how risk factors like early life stress influence mental health, we require a basic understanding of the developmental sequences that shape the maturation of the limbic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This knowledge will provide a foundation for understanding how different forms of early life adversity—varying in nature, severity and timing—alter developmental trajectories in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/limbic+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;limbic system&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to distinct mental health disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their recent study, DeNardo and her colleagues set out to study the developing brain of mice using a variety of experimental techniques. First, they created a new behavioral assay (i.e., task), which is designed to model elevated risk-taking behavior in adolescent mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this assay, mice learned to avoid a signaled threat by stepping onto a safety platform," explained DeNardo. "We found that both juvenile and adolescent mice exhibited lower levels of threat avoidance compared to adults, consistent with what has been observed in humans."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers subsequently delivered molecules in the brain of mice using viral expression techniques. These molecules allowed them to track and manipulate the animals' neural activity as they were completing the behavioral task.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;They employed a technique called fiber photometry, which allows neuroscientists to monitor the activity of neurons in the brain of living animals. With this technique, they specifically measured activity in three main brain regions known to be linked with emotional regulation and fear-based learning, the PFC, NAc and BLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that in mPFC, cues that predicted an impending threat as well as safe locations were more strongly coded in adults," said DeNardo. "In contrast, behavior-associated activity patterns in the NAc and BLA were more similar between the age groups, suggesting that those regions develop faster. We then used optogenetics to precisely manipulate activity in top-down mPFC pathways during presentations of threat-predictive cues."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dialing the activity of neurons in these mPFC pathways up or down using optogenetic tools, the researchers observed distinctive relationships between activity in specific pathways and the avoidant behavior of animals in different age groups. In addition, they tried to better understand how mPFC pathways engage with specific cell types in the NAc and BLA at each stage of development, combining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/optogenetic+tools/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;optogenetic tools&lt;/a&gt; with immediate early gene staining (i.e., a method to mark neurons that were recently active).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Popular models of adolescent brain development suggested that weak prefrontal control of the NAc and BLA enable elevated risky behaviors in younger individuals," said DeNardo. "Then, progressive strengthening of top-down control eventually allows adult behavioral repertoires to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"By examining the development of mPFC top-down pathways with synaptic and cellular precision, and by directly comparing developmental timing in the mPFC-NAc and mPFC-BLA pathways, we discovered that while there is synaptic strengthening across development, some changes are punctuated rather than gradual."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings gathered by DeNardo and her colleagues suggest that even if synapses gradually become stronger as mice develop, they can also undergo sudden shifts. For example, they found that while mPFC-NAc synapses gradually increase in strength, the strength of mPFC-BLA synapses remains steady and this pathway only appears to undergo changes in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Moreover, mPFC pathways preferentially connect with different behaviorally relevant cell types in NAc and BLA in juvenile, adolescent and adult stages," said DeNardo. "As a result, mPFC pathways have distinct behavioral functions in each age group. Thus, we found that heterogenous timelines in the synaptic maturation of the two pathways shape behavioral repertoires, allowing individuals to be optimally adapted to age-specific challenges."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent study sheds new light on the intricate neural processes underpinning the learning of avoidant behaviors throughout development. In the future, they could pave the way for further research examining the adaptation of neural pathways linked to emotional learning in response to adverse life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are currently working on a new study investigating how early life stress impacts the development of the mPFC-BLA pathway and affects threat avoidance behavior in adolescence," added DeNardo.&lt;/p&gt;

So far this year, there have been more than &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/21/measles-cases/"&gt;250 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, compared to 285 cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the measles outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html?utm_campaign=SPOTREPS&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Cun0COYpVOlWGsNYFof9rVNPI3BOB4uZe66ZTd8EI1NT2WH7XFwJlbbxQ80c6KpwGQg6kaI-XWKd6YL9oOiP3_i_eKg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351798716&amp;amp;utm_content=351798716&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt; to spread&lt;/a&gt; and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people vaccinated for the disease will have lifelong protection, there are some instances when another dose is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Do you need a booster?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to know if you need a measles booster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best defense against measles is two doses of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine during childhood. With those, you are considered fully vaccinated for life and do not need a booster shot, even if there is an outbreak in your area. The two-dose regimen began in 1989.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may need another shot if you received the MMR vaccine between 1963 and 1968 because you may have received a “killed” measles vaccine used at the time, which is not adequate protection. The current vaccine is live, meaning it has a small, weakened dose of measles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, you likely had only one shot, which the CDC recommended at the time.  A single dose is about 93% effective against measles. If you are traveling to places with high rates of measles or lower vaccination rates than the U.S., you may want to get a second shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not need a booster shot if you were born before 1957 because you likely were infected in childhood and have presumed protection against measles.  “If you got measles as a child, you don’t need to worry, because that’s the best immunity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/find-a-doctor/detail/leslie-diaz-1750342689"&gt;Dr. Leslie Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist with Palm Beach Health Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public health experts recommend a booster if you work in healthcare or plan to travel to areas with outbreaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are immunocompromised or pregnant, you should not get a booster. There is a risk of the live virus crossing the placenta. However, pregnant women need to be extra cautious because contracting measles can cause congenital defects in an unborn baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Testing for measles immunity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone uncertain whether they have immunity to measles can take a blood test (also called a titer test) to measure antibodies against measles in your blood. You can get the test at most primary care offices, retail sites like &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/titers-and-immunity-testing"&gt;CVS Minute Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, or your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test is positive, you have immunity to the disease from a previous vaccination or an infection. Negative test results mean you have no immunity. Diaz says not to rely on the results entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the titer test is positive, you have some immunity, but it doesn’t quantify how much. It doesn’t say you have great or poor immunity, so if it is positive you can take some time, but you probably should still get the booster,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Anne Algie, a Lee County nurse, took the titer test earlier this week. “I will get the results and then make a decision whether I need the booster,” she said. “I will be 70 soon, and while in great health, I do have a few autoimmune diseases and a few other health issues in my history.  I want to be safe for myself and for the others in my community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Bartle, a Miami/Fort Lauderdale medical social worker, is scheduled for a measles titer test on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I received two doses of the vaccine over 30 years ago,” she said. “I’m getting a titer test to be careful. If my antibodies are okay, I won’t get a booster, if they are low I will.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartle said she is nervous about the side effects of a live attenuated vaccine. “But I would rather tough it out through mild symptoms than contract what is one of the most contagious viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says getting another dose is safe, even if you already have some immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk is really close to nothing,” Diaz said. “You may feel achy for a few days or have irritation at the injection site, the same side effects as with any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do have some measles immunity, you are more likely to have a milder illness, and less likely to spread the disease to many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local county health departments can help if you have immunizations recorded in the &lt;a href="https://flshotsusers.com/"&gt;Florida SHOTS&lt;/a&gt; system, which tracks immunization records for vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The symptoms of measles&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can spread quickly. On average, one infected person may infect about &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/28/measles-outbreak/"&gt;15 other people&lt;/a&gt;, according to Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease infects the respiratory tract before spreading throughout the body. Diaz said the symptoms come on 10 to 14 days after exposure. “It starts with typical viral stuff — cough, sore throat, runny nose. Then the rash appears along with red, itchy eyes known as conjunctivitis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the vaccine, it takes about two weeks to get the full benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all need to pay attention to the outbreaks and keep close surveillance,” Diaz said. “It still can get out of hand because it’s very contagious. You will need to decide when you need a booster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,  Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Fox News this week: “I’m a freedom-of-choice person” regarding vaccines. He also said the government is providing vitamin A to the measles outbreak-impacted areas in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say children with measles are at an increased risk of vitamin A deficiency and supplementation might reduce death, adding that the better choice is to prevent measles from happening in the first place through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun Sentinel health reporter Cindy Goodman can be reached at cgoodman@sunsentinel.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The change is the latest shift in how Vermont now views Covid as an &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/02/01/as-omicron-surge-eases-officials-look-to-a-future-of-endemic-covid-19/"&gt;“endemic” disease&lt;/a&gt;, more like the flu or other seasonal illnesses than a pandemic that stands as the forefront of public health priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-light-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-3 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c0213cbd22f6b8fbb5ef50a67f12df73"&gt;READ MORE&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermonters have gotten older, but has the state gotten wiser? Are officials better and more prepared to tackle public health crises as they arise? Or is Vermont primed to repeat a cycle of needless suffering and death?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy of Covid goes well beyond the impact of the virus itself. Covid has left Vermont with tools that could help address longtime public health challenges along with emerging threats — and with vulnerabilities in public trust and health systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Vermont Department of Health say that Covid was the most daunting challenge they have ever faced, but it left them with new tools and structures that they have implemented in their day-to-day work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also celebrated the state’s track record with the virus. Vermont has one of the lowest Covid death rates in the nation, behind only Hawaii and Puerto Rico, according to the &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_deaths-rate-total"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not how Anne Sosin sees it. A lecturer at Dartmouth College and health equity researcher, Sosin reflected on how Covid revealed disparities in Vermont society that continue to today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sosin said Covid has added to the “burden” of illnesses like flu and RSV on hospitals and health care workers in the winter months. It has also added a “large footprint” of disability, she said. While &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/05/12/3-years-into-the-pandemic-vermonters-are-still-getting-and-struggling-with-long-covid/"&gt;long Covid&lt;/a&gt; is the most well-known aftereffect of contracting Covid, experts are just beginning to understand how a Covid infection can cause &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/well/covid-long-term-health-damage.html"&gt;long-term health impacts&lt;/a&gt; on multiple body systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid has left Vermont — and the nation — with a lasting legacy of mistrust and misinformation, one that appears to be affecting public health response at a federal level, Sosin said. She said the measles outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;spreading in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has been fueled by vaccine skepticism that began long before the Covid pandemic, which then amplified it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re gonna see a lot of tragedies over the next few years,” Sosin said. “It’s going to get a lot worse before we, ultimately, recognize we have to rebuild.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Levine, the outgoing commissioner of the health department, echoed that concern in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While when compared to national data Vermont remains a leader in immunization – even with numbers I would not brag about – it worries me that the uptake on preventative measures like vaccination has declined so shortly after the pandemic reminded us why they are so necessary,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pandemic-era innovations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid has left a mark on how the health department is able to respond to other public health challenges, staff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those developments has been Covid wastewater surveillance, which allows state and local governments to measure virus levels in a community by taking samples at wastewater treatment plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater surveillance was done in academic institutions and for research purposes prior to Covid, but it really became a public health tool during Covid,” said Patsy Kelso, the state epidemiologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department’s public health lab is now gearing up to use wastewater surveillance to measure mpox, seasonal influenza and Candida auris, a hospital-related illness, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00562-0/abstract"&gt;scientific community is also investigating&lt;/a&gt; how to utilize mRNA vaccines, developed for Covid, on other infectious diseases like the flu as well. Antigen tests that can &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/at-home-combo-flu-covid-tests"&gt;detect both Covid and the flu&lt;/a&gt; are already on the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen Reid, then the state director of health surveillance, said the pandemic also revealed the need for the state department of health to work more closely with community groups that represent marginalized Vermonters. Covid had a disproportionate impact on &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/02/07/vermont-has-promised-equal-vaccine-access-for-people-of-color-will-it-be-enough/"&gt;Vermonters of color&lt;/a&gt;, older residents and &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/06/04/immunocompromised-vermonters-navigate-the-new-normal/"&gt;people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very first year of Covid really sort of laid bare what we’ve known for a long time, which is that health disparities have an impact on high-risk populations and underserved populations, and we saw that in Covid time and time again,” said Reid, who now leads the health department’s infectious disease division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont responded by targeting &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/03/17/state-officials-use-on-the-ground-outreach-to-promote-vaccination-among-vermonters-of-color/"&gt;vaccine outreach&lt;/a&gt; to those individuals, and some of that effort has changed the way that the health department continues to collaborate with marginalized communities. The health department just had its first “tabletop” exercise — an emergency-preparedness simulation — with community groups like Migrant Justice and Bridges to Health, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sosin also noted the importance of community organizations in responding to Covid in a different way. Early in the pandemic, local efforts like &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/03/10/virus-in-vermont-in-mutual-aid-groups-people-help-one-another/"&gt;mutual aid groups&lt;/a&gt; formed an integral part of helping to reach vulnerable Vermonters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-light-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-4 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c0213cbd22f6b8fbb5ef50a67f12df73"&gt;READ MORE&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early in the response that communities would … have a telephone tree, and they would see who was at risk, and they would shop for groceries (for those people),” she said. “We don’t sometimes think of that as public health, but those are the things that enable people to comply with public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic response at a state and federal level included a vast expansion of social programs that directly — and indirectly — affected people’s health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw the unprecedented use of housing policy as a tool for pandemic control” with the housing of unsheltered Vermonters in motels and the moratorium on evictions, Sosin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government expanded Medicaid eligibility, extended the Child Income Tax Credit and provided several stimulus payments. Those initiatives had a concrete &lt;a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/stimulus-payments-child-tax-credit-expansion-were-critical-parts-of-successful"&gt;impact on child poverty&lt;/a&gt; in the years they occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government also lifted restrictions on telehealth, which was beneficial to rural health access, she said. “Unfortunately,” she said, that &lt;a href="https://www.asha.org/news/2025/time-is-running-out-for-medicare-telehealth-coverage-and-addressing-part-b-cuts/?srsltid=AfmBOopAI3sM-570B4BIt01WREFZaQ9bH0GyrEyyMAg8a_Xmurl8zRhQ"&gt;flexibility is about to end&lt;/a&gt; unless the federal government extends it — one of many programs Sosin said was at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Emerging threats’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early months of 2025, President Donald Trump issued executive orders &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/"&gt;withdrawing the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and cutting foreign health aid. His administration announced &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-nih-medical-research-funding-cut-indirect-costs-e7629d0d45d141b2ac47c54550411aff"&gt;hundreds of millions of dollars of funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; to institutions conducting health research, something that has Sosin worried about the country’s ability to prepare for future health challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be able to generate evidence in real time in response to emerging threats. And research institutions play a critical role in that,” she said. “The existence of research infrastructure was critical to really understanding Covid-19 and to developing tools to respond to it” — from therapeutics to testing to vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those threats include bird flu or H5N1, which has infected poultry and dairy livestock nationwide and sickened humans, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;primarily farm workers&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. has also recently seen a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html"&gt;surge in measles cases&lt;/a&gt; led by an outbreak in western Texas. Experts have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/measles-outbreak-spread"&gt;linked the rise&lt;/a&gt; in measles to a decline in childhood vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been some conversation around (bird flu) and its pandemic threat potential. And to some extent, I think that that’s the wrong question,” she said. “The question is not about just the pathogen and what its trajectory will be, but rather, how prepared we are to respond as a state in the absence of the policy response and federal infrastructure? How are we going to do this without the federal resources coming our way?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She referenced newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has a long track record of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02603-5/fulltext"&gt;anti-vaccine activism&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has recently recommended &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html"&gt;unproven health supplements&lt;/a&gt; to treat measles while casting doubts on the safety of the measles vaccine amid a growing outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-light-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-5 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c0213cbd22f6b8fbb5ef50a67f12df73"&gt;READ MORE&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a large political economy that’s fueled the rise of RFK and other extreme figures,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sosin said the “abdication” of health response at the federal level has highlighted how important state leadership will be going forward. “The state needs to prepare for the vacuum of federal leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine — who declined to be interviewed by VTDigger on the Covid anniversary, citing travel plans in the days prior to his &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/02/07/vermont-health-commissioner-mark-levine-announces-his-retirement/"&gt;departure from his role at the health department&lt;/a&gt; — shared similar concerns about the federal government to Sosin in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The turbulence we are seeing in public health at the federal level only underscores the point that here in Vermont, we have to be willing to do what it takes to be good neighbors to each other and protect our communities,” Levine said via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His top takeaway: Vermont, get vaccinated. Despite the state’s initial progress on the vaccine, uptake for Covid and flu shots have fallen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that what we are seeing in our vaccination rates is a temporary setback, and that it will not take another dire public health emergency to find out if we have learned the right lessons,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story was wrong about the current job title of a public health official with the Vermont Department of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second story in a two-part series that looks back on the impact of Covid-19 in Vermont after five years. The first story, &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/03/14/new-technology-and-mistrust-is-legacy-of-covid-19-for-vermont-public-health/"&gt;“New technology, and mistrust, is legacy of Covid-19 for Vermont public health,” can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patsy Kelso, Vermont’s state epidemiologist, remembers hearing about Covid-19 for the first time through the “routine channels.” The Centers for Disease Control and other public health entities regularly share information about emerging infectious diseases, from mpox virus circulating worldwide to Ebola outbreaks in Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was nothing, at first, that suggested Covid would be the one to shut down the world. “It did take me by surprise, personally, how quickly things ramped up,” Kelso said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of Covid within the United States was so misunderstood that the focus of many experts was on preventing transmission from international travelers. In reality, the virus had been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=January%2030%2C%202020,of%20cases%20up%20to%20seven."&gt;spreading nationwide for months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont officials recommended hand washing and staying home when sick, but masking and social distancing were not yet on the horizon for the general public. In fact, only three days after Vermont’s first Covid case on March 7, 2020, hundreds of people attended a University of Vermont basketball game. At least &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/06/18/uvm-basketball-game-was-a-major-spreading-event-vtdigger-survey-finds/"&gt;20 confirmed Covid cases&lt;/a&gt; were later linked to the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the situation was quick to change. On March 15, 2020, Gov. Phil Scott ordered &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/03/15/scott-orders-schools-to-close/"&gt;K-12 schools to shut down&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Covid’s spread. A flurry of other closures followed, until Scott issued a blanket order on March 24: &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/03/24/stay-home-scott-orders-in-response-to-covid-19-outbreak-in-vermont/"&gt;“Stay home” and “stay safe.” &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid tracing in the state began with a whiteboard in Kelso’s office listing individual Vermonters’ initials and their test results. Then she had to bring in a second whiteboard. Then the entire office was sent home, and the department was forced to rapidly come up with a system for tracking hundreds of people and tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the testing side, Helen Reid, then director of health surveillance at the Vermont Department of Health, was scrambling to scale up Covid laboratory testing. Early shortages of basic testing equipment — pipette tips, plastic — hampered their progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was hard to anticipate the scale that this would go to,” said Reid, who now heads the department's infectious disease division. “So with every new piece of information, we were sort of pivoting and adjusting our approach, and doing it pretty quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with supplies, the department was in desperate need of more staff. Officials put out a call early on for “basically anyone in state government who had a microbiology degree,” Reid said. Still, she recalled working extremely long hours in the early weeks of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went from, I think it was, testing about 56 specimens a day in the early days of Covid, to our team testing 1,500 per day by the end of May, because we didn't really have a choice at that point,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the health department scrambled, state officials tallied the numbers. &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/04/02/state-models-shows-covid-19-caseload-peaking-in-mid-april-under-likely-scenario/"&gt;Early Covid press conferences&lt;/a&gt; featured charts of hospital capacity and the amount of need under “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. In those early months of the pandemic, Vermont did not come close to hitting its hospital capacity. In fact, cases ebbed into the spring and summer months, and the state reported zero deaths for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Sosin, a health equity researcher and lecturer at Dartmouth College, recalled Vermonters in that time beginning to talk about the state as an &lt;a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/programs/2021-01-21/it-was-a-pandemic-escape-community-in-1918-and-now"&gt;“escape community,”&lt;/a&gt; protected from Covid by its relative isolation and rurality. But she said she had reason to be skeptical since her research in health equity suggested rural areas can be uniquely vulnerable to illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people think about disease risk as “distances between houses and physical infrastructure,” but rural communities often have tight-knit bonds and anchor institutions like schools and employers that bring them together, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural areas also have more essential workers and fewer hospital beds and other health infrastructure. Yet she was sympathetic to those who wanted to return to their pre-pandemic lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of us want to alter our daily lives for months or years on end,” Sosin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccine goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination campaign in 2021 marked a new stage in the pandemic. After rolling out the vaccine to older and high-risk Vermonters, Scott announced that May a benchmark-based plan to reopen Vermont: If &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/05/21/scott-ill-lift-all-covid-restrictions-when-80-are-vaccinated/"&gt;80% of Vermonters get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, he said, he would lift major Covid restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Admittedly, this would be an ambitious goal for most,” he said at a press conference announcing the initiative. “And to be honest, most states won’t come close to reaching it. But I believe Vermont can show the country how it’s done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 14, 2021, &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/06/14/vermont-reopens-scott-lifts-restrictions-as-state-reaches-80-vaccination-goal/"&gt;the state hit that goal&lt;/a&gt;, and Scott followed through on his promise. Once again, Vermonters enjoyed a summer light on Covid limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont remains close to the top of the nation in its initial Covid vaccination rate, tied with three other states, &lt;a href="http://usafacts.org"&gt;according to USAfacts.org&lt;/a&gt;. Kelso praised the policy, saying that it helped limit deaths later in the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that was a strong policy that resulted in both large uptake of the vaccine, and also quickly, because Vermonters wanted things to reopen,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once again, the Covid ease was not to last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That summer, the more severe and infectious &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/13/what-vermonters-need-to-know-about-the-delta-variant/"&gt;Delta variant&lt;/a&gt; began circulating through Vermont. Cases and deaths surged in the fall. Then Omicron hit. The less severe, but extremely contagious, variant spread quickly nationwide. In Vermont, reported hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/01/14/vermont-reports-100-people-hospitalized-for-covid-and-2300-new-cases/"&gt;topped the state’s hospital bed capacity&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to take &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/02/04/did-vermont-hospitals-get-overwhelmed-during-omicron-surge/"&gt;emergency staffing measures&lt;/a&gt; for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott pushed forward with reopening despite the rise. Just as Omicron began to wane, he announced the &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/02/18/experts-weigh-scotts-decision-to-end-school-mask-mandate-guidance/"&gt;end of school mask mandates&lt;/a&gt;, citing the need for children to return to normalcy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Sosin remains critical of this policy. She said the state leadership early in the pandemic was “fast and effective,” but “lost discipline in responding to the pandemic in later stages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-light-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-3 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c0213cbd22f6b8fbb5ef50a67f12df73"&gt;READ MORE&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She argues that masking, tied with other Covid-concious policies, actually helped to keep schools open during the worst of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of us thought that we should shut the state down the way we did in March 2020,” she said. “We knew a lot more and had many more tools to respond to the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelso took a more positive view of the state’s response, but said the restrictions and regulations were a balance that had trade offs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide and public health policies in Vermont contributed to the state having the lowest death rate in the nation, she said, but there were downsides to some of them as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Limiting visitation in long-term care facilities, for example, really helped reduce introduction of the virus into a facility where it could then spread quickly and result in terrible outcomes, but that also had devastating impacts on individuals’ lives,” Kelso said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont might have had a comparatively low death rate, but that’s not how Sosin thinks when evaluating the state’s performance. “I never think about it in terms of Vermont versus Texas. I think about it in terms of lives that didn't need to be lost,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always think we measure this on our own terms, and we would not resort to lowest-common-denominator metrics in thinking about public health, or the preservation of human life,” Sosin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story was wrong about the current job title of a public health official with the Vermont Department of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;
