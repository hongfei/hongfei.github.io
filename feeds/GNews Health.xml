&lt;p&gt;“The research is also showing that if you have two groups of individuals, someone who has comorbid metabolic diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, versus somebody who doesn’t, and both of these individuals have dementia, the rates of progression of dementia in somebody who doesn’t have metabolic risk factors tend to be slower,” explained Fesharaki-Zadeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to make changes and corrections, he noted, whether you’re a young, seemingly healthy person, in your 80s or 90s, or someone who has already been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains are highly malleable, Fesharaki-Zadeh said. So if you decide to make healthy lifestyle changes at any point, your brain will respond and be healthier for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dementia-research-new-risk-factors-goog_l_69209634e4b06c13afa4a363" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7994329"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Health experts say 95% of people in a region must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity and stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without sustained attention, hard-fought gains can easily be lost," the WHO said. "Where children are unvaccinated, outbreaks occur. Based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) concluded that measles elimination is under threat, as the disease resurged in numerous countries that achieved, or were close to achieving, elimination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/more-than-150-unvaccinated-students-quarantined-in-south-carolina-measles-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:More than 150 unvaccinated students quarantined in South Carolina measles outbreak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;b&gt;More than 150 unvaccinated students quarantined in South Carolina measles outbreak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to advocate for the MMR vaccine as the most effective means to combat the deadly and highly contagious virus.

			&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus may increase stress levels by keeping the body that much closer to a fight-or-flight response to sound, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By carefully studying the facial expressions of people with &lt;span&gt;and without tinnitus&lt;/span&gt;, scientists have found a pattern of altered involuntary facial movements and pupil dilation associated with distress and threat assessment in those with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by cataloguing the facial movements of their tinnitus participants, the team of researchers, led by neuroscientist Daniel Polley of Mass General Brigham in the US, was even able to predict the severity of the ear-ringing condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tinnitus Is Somehow Linked to a Crucial Bodily Function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that people with debilitating chronic tinnitus experience heightened vigilance and react to normal, everyday sounds as though they were threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-tinnitus-facial-eye-biomarkers-could-unlock-testing-treatments"&gt;Polley says&lt;/a&gt;, "we directly observed a signature of tinnitus severity. When we began this study, we didn't know if sounds would elicit facial movements; so, to discover that these movements not only occur, but can provide the most informative measure to date of tinnitus distress, is quite surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is a condition in which a constant buzzing, clicking, or high-pitched ringing can be heard in one or both ears (but not by anyone else).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows what causes it, and it currently has no objective clinical biomarkers, since tinnitus is a purely subjective experience, like migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine if  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183755" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; severity were determined by giving patients a questionnaire – this is the state of affairs for some common neurological disorders like tinnitus," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-tinnitus-facial-eye-biomarkers-could-unlock-testing-treatments"&gt;Polley says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350162"&gt;difficult to diagnose&lt;/a&gt; and even more challenging to track over time. There is also no known cure, although some sufferers report symptom reductions or&lt;span&gt; better symptom management&lt;/span&gt; after trying &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/tinnitus"&gt;sound therapy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-202406053047"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007330"&gt;tinnitus retraining therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-and-what-to-do-about-it"&gt;Almost everyone&lt;/a&gt; will experience tinnitus at some point in their lives, but for most people, it will be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is when the condition lasts for at least six months, and it affects more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.2189"&gt;120 million people around the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also notoriously &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/14164-tinnitus"&gt;frustrating for patients&lt;/a&gt;, and treatment options are inconsistent, which can leave some people feeling dismissed or unsupported in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it's severe enough to disrupt sleep and interfere with daily activities, with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0um3YAzHJzA"&gt;strong links to depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any clue that can help doctors understand the condition may bring us closer to knowing its causes, which could then help with the development of new, more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human faces undergo a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microexpression"&gt;microexpressions&lt;/a&gt;: vanishingly brief, involuntary twitches that can reveal strong emotions, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, scientists have also made headway in using facial cues to diagnose the severity of conditions that lack clear clinical biomarkers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-melancholia-depression-can-be-diagnosed-by-facial-expression"&gt;severe depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polley and his team adopted a similar approach for studying tinnitus. They recruited 97 study participants – 47 with tinnitus or sound sensitivity, and 50 without – and made them listen to a range of sounds from a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1027-6"&gt;previously compiled database&lt;/a&gt; of emotionally evocative audio recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sounds all have assigned associations, from positive sounds such as soft music and laughter, through more neutral sounds such as background chatter, rustling paper, and kitchen sounds, to unpleasant sounds such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01643-0"&gt;screeching metal&lt;/a&gt;, sirens, and alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-could-be-our-brains-way-of-coping-with-nerve-damage"&gt;Tinnitus Could Be Our Brain's Way of Coping With Nerve Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While listening to these sounds, each participant had their facial expressions tracked, and their eyes recorded to look for signs of pupil dilation as the body shifts into threat assessment mode. Then, AI software was used to tease out tiny changes in facial expression that human eyes might miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control group of tinnitus-free participants tended to show microexpressions consistent with the emotional association of each sound: a slight smile for pleasant sounds, and a slight frown for unpleasant sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the tinnitus participants showed markedly reduced facial changes compared to the control group, regardless of how pleasant or unpleasant the sound was. Meanwhile, their pupils dilated extra wide for all sounds – again, no matter the category. The pupils of the control group dilated only for the most unpleasant, loudest sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these markers individually – the lack of facial expression and the exaggerated pupil response – enabled the scientists to gauge not just &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; or not a participant had tinnitus, but how severely they were impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popular idea in tinnitus research is that, in response to hearing loss, the brain &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-and-what-to-do-about-it"&gt;'turns up' its auditory pathways to compensate&lt;/a&gt; (although not all cases of tinnitus are associated with hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this proposed mechanism cannot predict the severity of the condition, suggesting it may be only part of the overall picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is likely to be a complex condition, with a wide range of causes and presentations. The work of Polley and his team fills in some of the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These biomarkers get to the root of the distress," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-tinnitus-facial-eye-biomarkers-could-unlock-testing-treatments"&gt;Polley says&lt;/a&gt;. "While imaging might show hyperactive brain regions in tinnitus patients, these biomarkers reveal body-wide threat evaluation systems that are operating outside of their normal range, leading to the distressful symptoms they experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp1934"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest mistake you’re making is choosing the wrong form of vitamin D supplement. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D3 is from animals, and it is the type you make from the sun, which is absorbed better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose an independently-tested supplement or add fatty fish and fortified foods to your diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might be doing everything right—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;taking a vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt;, drinking milk, eating salmon and soaking up midday rays.

Yet almost 25% of people in the United States are running low. Vitamin D plays far more roles in the body than you may realize.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

“While its claim to fame is often associated with the role it plays in protecting bone health through helping the body absorb calcium, that’s not all you need vitamin D for,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/elizabeth-shaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., RDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s also involved in communication in the body, muscle movement and immune health. In fact, you need vitamin D to help kick free radicals out of your body, like the common cold and flu, so you can stay healthy.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;When you look at vitamin D supplements options, you may notice two forms available: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. While both can help raise and maintain vitamin D levels, they come from different sources and your body utilizes them differently. Below we explore what sets the two apart. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin D2 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D2, also known by its scientific name ergocalciferol, comes primarily from plant-based sources. “Vitamin D2 is photosynthesized in plants, mushrooms and yeasts. In other words, mushrooms exposed to sunlight synthesize vitamin D2,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/wellness/authors/holli-ryan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holli Ryan, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both D2 and D3 must undergo two steps to become biologically active: first, conversion in the liver, then again in the kidney. However, once activated, research shows that vitamin D3 is more effective at raising and maintaining 25(OH)D levels, which is your blood serum vitamin D status. Vitamin D2 has structural differences that reduce its ability to bind to vitamin D-binding protein, and it also breaks down more quickly. Its shorter half-life means it doesn’t stay in your system as long either. Ultimately, making it the less-than-desirable option.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol, is found in animal-based foods such as salmon, tuna, herring, egg yolks, and cheese, as well as in fortified foods like dairy milk and orange juice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also the form your body naturally produces when you get some rays. “Vitamin D3 is closer to the form your body naturally makes from sunlight, so it’s more efficient at supporting and maintaining vitamin D levels,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bonnie-taub-dix-11796963" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the body can use both forms of vitamin D, studies show that vitamin D3 can raise blood levels of vitamin D higher and for longer than vitamin D2, says Shaw. In fact, guidelines indicate that vitamin D3 is approximately five times more potent at raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations, compared to D2.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With nearly 5% of the population at risk of vitamin D deficiency and another 18% with insufficient levels, maintaining adequate levels is a widespread problem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Vitamin D plays multiple critical roles in health, from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting strong bones&lt;/a&gt; to bolstering immune health to aiding with muscle movement. When levels run low, it may lead to weakened immunity, fatigue, or low mood. That’s why choosing the right form of vitamin D is so important.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few expert-backed tips to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help guide you&lt;/a&gt; towards picking up the right vitamin D supplement.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for independently tested brands&lt;/strong&gt;: Start by choosing a supplement verified by a trusted independent testing organization. “Labels from testing organizations, like NSF certified or USP, mean you know what’s on the label is in the bottle,” says Shaw. This helps ensure you’re choosing a safe, high-quality option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose D3:&lt;/strong&gt; Check that the supplement is in D3 form. “It should read ‘cholecalciferol’ if it has the D3 form,” Shaw points out.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find vegan-friendly D3&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re vegan, look for an algae-derived vitamin D3 supplement, since most D3 supplements are derived from lanolin (sheep’s wool), says Ryan. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a form you’ll take consistently: &lt;/strong&gt;Softgels and liquid drops are both good options;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;choose the form you’ll take most comfortably and consistently, advises Taub-Dix. And “check with your healthcare provider to determine what dose is right for you,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with fat in your diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Once you’ve found a tried and true supplement, don’t forget to pair it with fat. “Because vitamin D is fat-soluble, I always remind people to pair these foods with a source of healthy fat to support absorption,” says Shaw. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-ways-to-get-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Ways to Get Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to choosing the right vitamin D supplement, your diet, beverage choices and scheduling in sunshine time can help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost your vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dive into fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt;: Salmon, trout, sardines, herring and tuna are all &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the whole egg&lt;/strong&gt;: The yolk contains several nutrients, including vitamin D.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try wild or UVB-treated mushrooms:&lt;/strong&gt; Wild mushrooms naturally contain vitamin D2 and UVB-treated varieties can contain high amounts of vitamin D too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink milk: &lt;/strong&gt;Dairy milk is typically fortified with vitamin D. Plant-based milks may also be fortified - check the label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose fortified cereals: &lt;/strong&gt;Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contain added vitamin D. Look for it on the nutrition facts panel.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a glass of OJ&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking 100% fortified orange juice can give you not only vitamin D but also calcium. &lt;strong&gt;(2,5)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule sunlight time:&lt;/strong&gt; While sunlight is a free and natural way to get vitamin D, several variables can make it challenging to rely on alone. Age, skin pigmentation, geographical location, sunscreen use, body fat percentage and the season all affect how much vitamin D your skin produces, says Ryan. “Exposing your skin to UVB rays from the sunlight for around 15 minutes daily without sunscreen can be helpful, but be sure to avoid excessive sun exposure without protecting your skin”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Monitor your levels regularly with a blood test to ensure you are maintaining adequate vitamin D levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The number one mistake people make when taking vitamin D is choosing the wrong form. Experts recommend selecting a vitamin D3 supplement over D2 for maximum benefit and absorption. Research states vitamin D3 is five times more potent than vitamin D2, and more effective at raising and maintaining blood vitamin D levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When picking out a supplement, make sure it’s independently tested, contains the D3 form, and comes in either soft or drop form. Other ways to boost your vitamin D levels are by eating fatty fish, mushrooms or drinking fortified milk or orange juice. Aim for at least 15 minutes of sunlight exposure a day. And don’t forget to monitor your vitamin D levels annually, as vitamin D plays a role in whole-body health.

I didn’t ask about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 38, a neurologist told me I have degenerative disc disease in my cervical spine that is so bad it looked like I spent years wrangling a jackhammer on a construction site. As a suburban mom and college professor, what could I have possibly done in life to contribute to this condition? Carry a growing baby in the björn and a toddler on my hip as I ran in and out of Target? Lug my entire office in a tote bag from class to class across campus? It has never been clear. So it made sense that the acupuncturist assumed all of my neck pain radiated from the bulging discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I brought up with Jade, though, was my tumor site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was in college,” I told her, “I had a malignant tumor removed from the base of my skull.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea,” Jade said with surprise. “Did you have physical therapy?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, I didn’t. It was so long ago, and I was so young,” I explained. “The surgeon removed a chunk of my scalp and it wasn’t until 10 years later that I realized he had actually removed part of my occipital bone, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stood close behind me, giving me time and space to put two and two together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is it possible that I have simultaneous issues causing my pain and discomfort?” I asked. “Could my decades-old surgery have anything to do with the chronic throbs I always feel on both sides of my neck?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jade sat me at the edge of the table and turned my head right, then down, then left as she ran the tip of her pointer finger along each side of my hanging head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood rushed into my cheeks. I fumbled for an answer to her unexpected question. Hearing no audible objection from me, Jade tenderly parted my hair. Her thumbs pushed inside the lime-sized hole in my head, precisely tracing the suboccipital muscles to see where they had reattached themselves after my surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;This is the photo that the author submitted to accompany her melanoma community profile.

I shifted on the table. It was probably my surgical oncologist. Who even knows that skin graft is there? My family, of course, but who else? My hairdresser? She is probably the only one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engrossed by the sea foam color sunlit on the wavy glass of the window, I sat transfixed. The soft spa sounds of lapping waves and sea birds chirping circulated in the room as I half listened to Jade speak about the physical trauma to my head and neck and the surgical scar that has now been part of my body for more than half my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t until we uncover old trauma like this and begin to treat it that we can truly heal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Jade was clearly referring to my physical body, her words synonymously triggered thoughts about something else too — the scars she can’t see on the inside. It has finally dawned on me that, even after continuously interacting with the world and understanding how it has shaped me, I never truly realized that surviving cancer as a young adult could still have an enormous impact on my life decades later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for people to not realize how much previous traumas affect them? &lt;a href="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Trauma-infographic.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68fd1945e4b011e80886928d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Trauma-infographic.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;According to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, 70% of adults in the U.S. have experienced some type of traumatic event at least once in their lives. That’s 235.1 million people. Trauma, then, is more universal than we probably realize. And while some people do not remember traumatic or painful experiences from the past at all, many others work to understand the potential effects on their lives. But do these attempts to understand what they’ve been through automatically translate into true healing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of these efforts, emotions and thoughts we ignore or push down can still manifest physically, sometimes as tension, fatigue, or even illness. In other words, “your body expresses what your mind suppresses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/loroxburgh/reel/C7znvUzSqP7/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Lauren Roxburgh" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68fd1945e4b011e80886928d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/loroxburgh/reel/C7znvUzSqP7/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Lauren Roxburgh&lt;/a&gt;, international body alignment expert and wellness educator dubbed The Body Whisperer. And while repressed memories may not be readily accessible, they can sometimes resurface later in life, often triggered by specific cues or situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in my acupuncturist’s office, I was suddenly aware that I had been holding that broken girl deep inside of me for too long. I felt ready to reconnect with her, to write her back into my story. As the mother of four children around the same age as when I was diagnosed with cancer, I see pieces of her in them. Each of them are navigating all the challenges that come with new adulthood — finding your own identity, learning to navigate new and old relationships, and developing emotional and financial independence. All of that was happening for me back then, too. How did I manage a cancer diagnosis on top of everything else? How could the 19-year-old me have juggled those balls and not have expected one to drop? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, age 19, just a few weeks before her biopsy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Jennifer Young"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Jennifer Young&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rush of memories released as Jade carefully pushed the slender points of filiform into the narrows of my neck. I thought back to my 19-year-old self and realized she and I still have a lot in common. She had to borrow wisps of hair from behind her ears to bobby pin over the bald spot on the back of her head every time she twisted up her hair. I still do that. She had to carefully cover the pockmarks on her shoulders from the vaccine shots with just-long-enough capped sleeves. I do that, too. She always yanked at her swimsuit to cover the square skin graft scar on her left butt cheek. Guess what? It still shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how did it never occur to me until this moment that the emotional trauma I endured as a young adult was even bigger and brighter than every blemish on my body? And while I am grateful to now have nurturing practitioners to help ease my physical pain, I realized that every time I worked to cover up these imperfections so that no one can see them, I stashed those old painful feelings beneath metal hairpins and bathing suit bottoms at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desperate to put as much space as possible between my trauma and the rest of my life, I thought I had to erase that chapter entirely. How would it feel if instead I paid closer attention to the cues my body has been giving me and worked to acknowledge that heartbreak from long ago?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although today many people are better at recognizing the emotional and psychological impacts of trauma like cancer has, I believe there are many others like me who never gave themselves that grace. Psychiatrist and author &lt;a href="https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68fd1945e4b011e80886928d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, underscores this notion in his bestselling book “The Body Keeps the Score”: “... trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account.” Is releasing these trapped emotions the key to restoring balance and well-being? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems like a no-brainer that missing bone from the back of my head was one likely cause of upper body pain for all of these years. But having my very own ah-ha moment in the least expected time and place is not lost on me, and what Jade has been saying gets through: A textbook understanding of trauma is not enough. True healing will only come if I accept every scar and allow each version of myself to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My physical wounds healed long ago, of course, but I now understand that scars — both physical and emotional — are stories our bodies carry, even when we’d prefer them to stay untold. Old traumas heal, it seems, not when we hide our scars, but when we finally let them speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that moment at my acupuncturist’s office, I’ve started unpacking this chapter more intentionally — reflecting on it, writing about it, and having honest conversations I used to avoid. It’s helped. I even worked up the courage to submit a survivor profile to a melanoma community on Instagram — including a photo that showed the scar on the back of my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I almost hit delete a dozen times! But I didn’t, and the multitude of likes and messages I received connected me to others whose lives had been touched by cancer — and, unexpectedly, it felt like that 19-year-old version of me was connected to them too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healing isn’t about going back; it’s about bringing every part of myself forward. And for the first time in a long time, that feels possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband married after she reached five years in remission.

                &lt;p&gt;Grocery store shelves are stacked with convenient, protein-ified snacks, from bars to soda. But how much should you rely on them if you're trying to avoid ultra-processed foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-cut-upfs-shares-3-lessons-after-year-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, a sports nutritionist, the answer is simple: it's "very, very easy" to consume &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-enough-protein-without-skimping-on-fiber-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;enough protein&lt;/a&gt; without relying on UPFs, which are linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease when eaten in large amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support his daily hourlong workout routine, which combines endurance training on an assault bike and weightlifting, he aims to consume around &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/protein-mistakes-health-issues-hit-your-goals-without-wasting-money-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;0.7g of protein&lt;/a&gt; per pound of body weight each day. Hobson said this is enough to build muscle, feel full, and fuel himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He used to turn to protein bars and shakes, which are typically ultra-processed, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ultra-processed-foods-impact-your-body-calories-weight-gain-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cut down on UPFs &lt;/a&gt;two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson shared how he hits his protein targets without eating UPFs, but stressed he is mindful of being overly restrictive. He does this by following the&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-follows-80-20-rule-diet-protein-fiber-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt; 80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;: eating whole, unprocessed foods most of the time, and whatever he's craving for the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still have a glass of wine. If I want a bit of chocolate, I will. If I want to have a pizza, I will," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson added that it's important not to obsess over single nutrients, such as protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you do that, then chances are you are missing out on other stuff," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f5b64409-1ca2-4daa-830e-f774a9a7db3e" data-toc-id="f5b64409-1ca2-4daa-830e-f774a9a7db3e"&gt;Eating oats with minimally processed protein powder for breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After he gets home from the gym, Hobson eats a bowl of overnight oats containing oats, milk, and a minimally processed protein powder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's whey protein that's been hydrolyzed, but it doesn't contain anything else," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats contain some protein, but they are high in soluble fiber, which helps lower cholesterol, and insoluble fiber, which supports smooth digestion and feeds the beneficial microbes in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="17a93eee-f410-41ab-b7a5-e4668d9819c3" data-toc-id="17a93eee-f410-41ab-b7a5-e4668d9819c3"&gt;Adding beans to soup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans are a cheap and convenient source of both protein and fiber. Just one cup of black beans, for example, contains around 15 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson adds them to his meals to up the protein count. "If I buy a ready-made soup, I will just chuck in half a can of beans," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="36a10c12-5c7d-40a4-ac56-1feb6a2a0293" data-toc-id="36a10c12-5c7d-40a4-ac56-1feb6a2a0293"&gt;Keeping the kitchen stocked with easy protein&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hobson always keeps his fridge stocked with protein sources, like canned tuna, tofu, and chicken, which he can quickly cook up and add to a stir-fry or stew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find it really easy just to use those foods," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His go-to is a source of protein with some pre-cooked rice from a bag, vegetables, and soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of hypermobility, where business meetings in Berlin follow red-eyes from Boston and leisure travelers chase sunsets across hemispheres, &lt;strong&gt;jet lag remains a stubborn adversary&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite decades of research and a booming wellness industry promising quick fixes, the human body continues to resist the tyranny of time zone shifts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jet lag isn’t just a minor inconvenience—it’s a physiological &lt;strong&gt;tug-of-war&lt;/strong&gt; between your internal clock and the external world. The result? Days of &lt;strong&gt;fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/this-popular-yogurt-should-be-avoided-according-to-this-expert/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="70829" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cognitive fog&lt;/strong&gt; that can derail even the most meticulously planned itinerary. And as global travel rebounds post-pandemic, the urgency to understand and mitigate jet lag has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes jet lag so insidious is its unpredictability. Two travelers on the same flight can experience vastly different symptoms. Age, chronotype, direction of travel, and even genetics play a role. Yet, the core conflict remains universal: our circadian rhythms, finely tuned to the &lt;strong&gt;24-hour cycle of light&lt;/strong&gt; and dark, don’t take kindly to abrupt changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a growing body of research is shedding new light on how to outsmart this biological inertia. From strategic light exposure to pre-flight sleep adjustments, scientists are uncovering practical, evidence-based strategies that could finally offer weary travelers a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Resetting the Clock: Light as the Master Regulator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The single most powerful tool in the jet lag arsenal? Light. Exposure to natural light is the primary cue that synchronizes our internal clocks with the external environment. Morning sunlight can help advance the circadian rhythm, making it easier to adjust to eastward travel, while evening light can delay it for westward shifts. The &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/jet-lag" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt; highlights light exposure as one of the most effective ways to reset your body clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apps like Timeshifter, developed with input from NASA scientists, use this principle to create personalized jet lag plans. They recommend when to seek or avoid light, &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/losing-attention-span-4-science-backed-habits-help-get-back/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="92798" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and sleep based on your itinerary and sleep patterns. While not a cure-all, these tools represent a leap forward from the days of blindly popping melatonin and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For travelers without access to such apps, the rule of thumb is simple: get outside. Even 20–30 minutes of natural light exposure in the morning can accelerate adaptation, especially when paired with light exercise like walking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sleep Strategically, Not Spontaneously&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most common mistakes travelers make is trying to “power through” jet lag by staying awake until local bedtime. The intention is right, but the execution often backfires. Sleep deprivation can intensify symptoms and make it harder to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend gradually shifting your &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/to-sleep-better-science-recommends-doing-this-1-2-hours-before-bed-and-its-surprisingly-simple/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="87863" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep schedule &lt;/a&gt;before departure. If you’re flying east, try going to bed and waking up an hour earlier each day for a few days before your flight. For westward travel, do the opposite. The &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/jet-lag" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; supports this approach as a proactive way to reduce jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Avoiding naps during the first day at your destination can also help, though short, strategic naps (20–30 minutes) may be beneficial if timed correctly. The key is consistency—your body needs clear signals to recalibrate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hydration, Caffeine, and the Myth of the Midnight Meal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Air travel is notoriously dehydrating, and dehydration can intensify jet lag symptoms. The Aerospace Medical Association recommends drinking at least eight ounces of water for every hour in the air. Alcohol and caffeine, while tempting, should be used sparingly. Caffeine can help with alertness but should be avoided within six hours of your intended bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging research suggests that meal timing may influence circadian rhythms. A study in Cell Reports found that mice who ate during their active phase adjusted more quickly to time zone changes. While human studies are ongoing, some experts suggest aligning meals with local time upon arrival to help reset the body’s internal clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Wearables to Chronomedicine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As interest in circadian health grows, so too does the technology designed to support it. Wearables like the &lt;strong&gt;Oura Ring &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;WHOOP strap&lt;/strong&gt; now track sleep stages and recovery metrics, offering insights into how travel affects the body. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are exploring chronobiotic drugs—compounds that can shift circadian rhythms more precisely than melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most promising frontier may lie in personalized medicine. Researchers are beginning to understand that circadian rhythms vary widely between individuals. Tailoring interventions to each person’s biological profile could redefine how we approach jet lag in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That future may still be on the horizon. For now, the best defense against jet lag remains a blend of science and strategy: plan ahead, seek the sun, hydrate well, and respect your body’s need for rest.&lt;/p&gt;

It measures blood flow when the heart is pushed to work harder. But what it doesn’t show is what’s happening inside the artery walls, the place where most &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fortis-cardiologist-explains-why-heart-attacks-strokes-happen-early-morning-most-of-the-time-between-4-00-am-and-101763639230537.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; actually begin. “A stress test looks at traffic flow. A CT coronary angiogram looks at the road itself, the cracks, potholes, and weak spots,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;While many assume heart attacks occur because of large or obvious blockages, Dr Yaranov clarified that most cardiac events are caused by small, soft, inflamed plaques.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;These plaques don’t obstruct blood flow enough to show up on a stress test, yet they can rupture suddenly, leading to a heart attack without warning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This is why, he explained, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-13-years-of-experience-shares-7-everyday-foods-that-may-block-arteries-and-increase-heart-attack-risk-101764929065150.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiology"&gt;cardiology&lt;/a&gt; is shifting its focus from asking whether there is a blockage to understanding whether there is any underlying coronary artery disease.“You can ace a stress test and still carry silent, unstable plaque,” Dr Yaranov noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which test actually reveals hidden heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;For individuals with symptoms, a family history of heart issues, diabetes, or high-risk profiles, Dr Yaranov recommends a CT Coronary Angiogram (CCTA) as a more accurate diagnostic tool.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Unlike a stress test, which shows how well blood is flowing, a CCTA visualises the artery walls in detail, revealing plaque buildup, weak spots, and early signs of disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“CCTA is the tool that actually sees the disease, not the shadow, not the guess, the disease itself,” he added.

People don’t realise that their food choices can harm their metabolism. Think of your metabolism as an engine; it powers your body and controls how well you burn calories. When your metabolism works well, you feel energetic and strong. But some common foods can slow down metabolism quietly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/05/550x309/_3eee26e2-6336-11e8-a998-12ee0acfa260_1764930241698.jpg" alt="When a person includes at least 4 to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, it helps enhance digestion and increase metabolism, which leads to weight loss.

Sugary beverages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks like soft drinks, packaged juices, and energy drinks may seem refreshing. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Still, they contain a lot of refined sugars that can spike your blood sugar levels, often leading to energy crashes and making you feel tired and sleepy.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;"Drinking these high-sugar beverages regularly can also make it harder for your body to use insulin, slowing your metabolism", nutritionist Siddhi Kripal tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/artificial-sweeteners-and-their-effect-on-blood-sugar/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, liquid calories don't fill you up, so you might end up eating more later. Instead of reaching for a sugary drink, try water, herbal tea, or flavoured water to keep your energy steady without a sugar rush.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2. Refined grains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you enjoy the soft texture of white bread and the smooth feel of refined pasta? However, these refined grains do not provide the nutrients and fiber that your body needs. They digest too quickly, which can cause spikes in blood sugar and lead to tiredness and increased fat storage. Choosing whole grains can help keep your energy stable throughout the day and support a healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3. Instant or ready-to-eat foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to grab instant noodles, chips, or frozen meals. However, these processed foods often have high levels of sodium, unhealthy fats, and preservatives. “These ingredients can cause inflammation and make it harder for your body to burn fat,” says the expert. Cooking simple meals from scratch, even when you’re busy, can make a big difference. The nutritionist cited how a client, a dad with three kids, started preparing healthy meals on weekends. He found that he felt more energetic, and his whole family enjoyed the benefits of fresh, home-cooked food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4. Low-protein breakfasts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is a necessary time to start your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/10-yoga-asanas-to-boost-metabolism-and-burn-belly-fat-yoga-expert-shares-a-20-minute-morning-routine-for-beginners-101764777445993.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="metabolism"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. One common mistake people make is skipping protein in the morning. Without enough protein, your breakfast won't give you the energy you need for the day. "A sugary cereal or plain toast alone isn't enough. Instead, add eggs, Greek yoghurt, or a scoop of plant-based protein powder to your breakfast," says the nutrition expert. Eating protein regularly can help boost your metabolism by repairing muscles and increasing calorie burn throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5. Refined vegetable oils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you checked your pantry lately? Oils are important for cooking, but many common oils, such as palm, sunflower, and corn oil, contain high levels of omega-6 fatty acids. "Overeating of these can lead to inflammation, which can hurt your metabolism", says the expert. Instead, use heart-healthy oils like olive or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gallbladder-removal-diet-nutritionist-6-simple-food-swaps-diarrhea-bloating-fatty-liver-coconut-oil-instead-of-canola-101755143338007.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="coconut oil"&gt;coconut oil&lt;/a&gt;, which are better for you and can help your metabolism work well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6. Caffeine overload&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee lovers enjoy caffeine for its ability to get them started in the morning; however, drinking too much caffeine can be harmful. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;"At the same time, a moderate amount can give your metabolism a short-term boost, too much caffeine increases cortisol levels, the stress hormone", says the nutritionist.&lt;/span&gt; This can lead to fat storage, especially around the belly. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It is important to keep your caffeine intake moderate and avoid drinking coffee late in the day, as it can disrupt sleep and affect a healthy metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;7. Gluten from modern wheat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern wheat has changed and now contains 3 to 4 times more gluten than older varieties. This excess gluten can cause digestive problems, such as bloating, which may slow your metabolism. “If you often have stomach issues, consider replacing modern wheat with gluten-free options like quinoa, millets, or brown rice,” says Kripal. You may notice more energy after making this dietary change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;8. Low water intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is often overlooked in nutrition. Even mild dehydration can lower your metabolism by 2-3%. Water is essential for quenching thirst and for almost every metabolic process in the body. “Aim to drink 8-10 glasses of water each day,” shares Kripal. You can also include hydrating foods and drinks, such as coconut water, herbal teas, and homemade soups, to stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;9. Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social drinks can make gatherings more enjoyable, but drinking alcohol, especially beer and sugary cocktails, can slow down your metabolism. When alcohol enters your body, your liver focuses on breaking it down, which temporarily stops fat from burning. "Alcohol also dehydrates you and affects the hormones that help regulate your metabolism", said the expert. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It is important to drink in moderation, try to have drinks less often, and look for non-alcoholic options to stay upbeat without hurting your metabolic health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;10. Low-fiber diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is important for your digestive health and helps your metabolism. Eating a low-fiber diet can make you feel tired and affect how well you digest food. “Try to include fiber-rich foods such as fruits, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/everyday-mix-vegetable-recipe-for-a-nutritious-plate-helping-you-increase-daily-veggie-intake-without-any-extra-effort-101764746253895.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vegetables"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, beans, and whole grains in your meals,” says the nutritionist. Feel lighter and more energetic after eating more fiber, which helps keep blood sugar levels steady and supports effective fat breakdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;11. Excess non-vegetarian consumption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating protein is important for your metabolism, but eating too much non-vegetarian food, especially red or processed meats, can cause issues. “These foods often contain a lot of saturated fat and not enough fiber, which can slow digestion,” shares the expert. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To support better digestive health and a more efficient metabolism, try balancing your meals with plant-based foods, salads, and lean proteins like steamed fish or chicken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note to readers:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;The deeper my husband got into boozing, the deeper I got into my own self-imposed bubble of silence. A loyal, loving wife doesn’t talk about her husband peeing in an alley or passing out in the middle of sex while still inside her. She doesn’t tell stories of turning away in bed, tears streaming because the sour stench of his drunken body is revolting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or was that just part of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; loyalty pledge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember a specific moment in my childhood that taught me to follow a code of silence. As the oldest of five, my responsibilities started young, and I thoroughly understood the expectation that I was to be the kid that gave no one any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We Midwesterners are not thought of as hotheaded, heart-on-our-sleeve types. Silence is simply understood as standard operating procedure. We aren’t brought up to expose ourselves or make ourselves vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do. We are. We exist. We move on. We don’t talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To place yourself in the middle of any story is to be vain. To call attention to something that should be kept private is simply not done. Unmet needs? Everybody has them. Talking about it won’t change anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevailing understanding around tough issues in polite society is to be quiet, at least where I was raised. But silence is also the expectation forced on all women. Be pretty and quiet and compliant and thoughtful. With an emphasis on quiet, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I have been as guilty of silence as every other woman before me. In what I assumed was marital loyalty, I kept quiet about my husband’s alcoholism, rarely even questioning why I did so. I didn’t cover for him or make excuses. I didn’t have to lie because life — the part visible to the world outside our home — looked fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-functioning drunk gets through life hiding it all. He’d tough it out through the hangover and go to work anyway. He’d compartmentalize his drinking into time slots so that outward appearances remain untouched. He’d rationalize that because he was still kicking ass on the job, he had it all under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I alone held the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played the role a loving wife is supposed to play. She protects her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking publicly about my husband’s flaws would be a betrayal, wouldn’t it? I thought so. But was my silence about him or me? I didn’t know then, and I don’t know now. But the silence, the silence I chose, languished inside me like something rotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding in. Holding back. Holding on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I paused on the sidewalk outside a Michigan Avenue high-rise and stared up at the carved stone arch that crested the double doors. Buses and taxis buzzed behind me, and pedestrians sidestepped me as I struggled with my &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/evelinamedina/which-human-emotion-are-you"&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no reason to be nervous, yet my heart thumped in my chest as I gathered myself for the appointment I’d made. With a therapist. A therapist to help me navigate addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse racing, palms sweating, I looked up at the building and took several deep breaths. Why was &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; standing here on the concrete feeling like a shaky schoolgirl? I suppose I irrationally thought of his continued drinking as &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; failure. I hadn’t found the exact right formula of love and concern that would get through to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there had been stretches of time where I believed he’d turned a corner, it never lasted more than a few months. And now, many years in, after so many empty promises and broken dreams and returns to booze, it was abundantly clear his problem was too big for me to handle alone, so I’d opened a browser and scrolled Psychology Today looking for practitioners with a specialization in alcoholism. It was one step up from the Yellow Pages, but I wasn’t going to ask friends for a referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here I was staring up at a building in downtown Chicago, steeling myself to say aloud for the first time, “My husband is an alcoholic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapist sat in her chair, notepad in hand, and asked, “What can I help you with?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband is an alcoholic, and I don’t know how to get him to stop,” I choked out, tears already filling my eyes and constricting my throat. My body trembled as I sat, hands gripping my thighs. I had said it. For the first time, I had said it. Out loud. Now it was real. There could be no more rationalizing. No more minimizing or softening the label by thinking of him as a “heavy drinker” or “having a drinking problem.” He was a full-on alcoholic. A drunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you suggested a support group? AA?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I laughed. Her question wasn’t intended as sarcasm, but all I could think was, “Honey, if a suggestion was all it took, I could add a Dr. prefix to my name and set out my own shingle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent 45 minutes discussing the ways in which I had attempted to get him to his come-to-Jesus moment. Then as the session wrapped up, she told me she “normally worked with the alcoholic, not the family” and repeated her suggestion of a support group. Then she asked whether I thought he would do better with a male or female therapist if she were to provide a referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t want a referral for him. Who he saw was his damn business! I needed help navigating and understanding his problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only years later that I realized she had never asked a single question about me. How &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was doing. How &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was coping. What support &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; might need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the ways of a woman only seeing part of her problem, my thoughts too were laser-focused on my husband’s issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a lifetime away from realizing that a crisis was in my future too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted with permission from &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUd1gOWGyyREHiaxJ1NU0Q9tjkxy0CFcmCH3nleILYEpNxjITXRmwJ-2BWLzgpCpuif2LgIOwt7x0HKb6h-2BI2eSnl6twK0kebeyNL4ccc5NkWtRhROoDa2HVbnAxgBKUtcO-2Fm80VnqTGr38yUrsd3s3WCgrWErymMzCtmV9lfOgezXfqN-2Fe7cfjTN3sjlepCm12OZ2nFzumlBEVhZrzaFOCVmdCDeSmdYL5zxx2v1zTL-2FgIb2K5g6AMaIjlcP270Yj5G2npY7gioXXmQHF-2BA6435vicwELjN-2BCFw3022h83el70gnti8O8IUMudmdrsm2TandHuPAzfEQoO1aQopHX69ELiyW7tirs32WZhy4C16fsLJD3idt51CDgCZ1j6LFI4k8g8SSBdtKyytei3EINNCZOYza9HCUDUbRW1px5dTOX8sFuvOjf7V4K5hMTOkR4R7Plxmz8U3CRQmb2o-2FW95TnwDPMehwt0fxywmoq2Pyc1AVV0F8ADc5WmifHhiG9qyBFbpUBnKS2XTgttdXX-2F2WgQFGmAAnv4-2BXGnXeTeEGgzAvWR66RI4w-2BxbTp-2BVVHfOrH13b1GzTosdsNf4CLZpdY5wdIIcgKFNuNdaeQbGQjA7y8gLXwBH9vx7C1zzjvZ-2FhLGAjZzVg-2BGCVc5eLIhghDBl0ibr6LtqxDdL-2BTO4WMGDEbwiAXRs8L3c1rXwFjMjmQ2akli99ROfsftAraVXvDo-3DOtlK_Ps5uOjyCpFslDeso1wdwvvUwnAohiFunuIxA7lzd9uSfz-2BDPamfPG9hlmc9Y0GgV3tEeJ9fFWPEYmnno7uhvujziORgEF3ErUy4fxfnhPtV-2BfSCeOsmK4Y35mqUxtZzK-2B4QIUKU-2Bl58LikAAvRdQDTzOxqgU4bGHNQfCtDXBqhG6XMF70jG2SLJ5BecYaEO9PnVOlCd-2FaTVRDywjta-2Foz-2F0LBAVEP87HhFrNNibB533LPWMwxwJ0TULJu2ic-2FJFHJZzWLJxuu-2BDOJ1zeHBgjXFnQpGhu434zo-2BGf3gEW24yJmGJsPzHALg-2Fqt1OXdN96skLUNzusDnr2KZkG84zN17ReZloN-2FXJVTYXV5yu2Y-2Bs-3D" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7981341" data-affiliate="true"&gt;“Where the Shadows Dance: He Got Sober.

What support &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; might need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the ways of a woman only seeing part of her problem, my thoughts too were laser-focused on my husband’s issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a lifetime away from realizing that a crisis was in my future too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted with permission from &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUd1gOWGyyREHiaxJ1NU0Q9tjkxy0CFcmCH3nleILYEpNxjITXRmwJ-2BWLzgpCpuif2LgIOwt7x0HKb6h-2BI2eSnl6twK0kebeyNL4ccc5NkWtRhROoDa2HVbnAxgBKUtcO-2Fm80VnqTGr38yUrsd3s3WCgrWErymMzCtmV9lfOgezXfqN-2Fe7cfjTN3sjlepCm12OZ2nFzumlBEVhZrzaFOCVmdCDeSmdYL5zxx2v1zTL-2FgIb2K5g6AMaIjlcP270Yj5G2npY7gioXXmQHF-2BA6435vicwELjN-2BCFw3022h83el70gnti8O8IUMudmdrsm2TandHuPAzfEQoO1aQopHX69ELiyW7tirs32WZhy4C16fsLJD3idt51CDgCZ1j6LFI4k8g8SSBdtKyytei3EINNCZOYza9HCUDUbRW1px5dTOX8sFuvOjf7V4K5hMTOkR4R7Plxmz8U3CRQmb2o-2FW95TnwDPMehwt0fxywmoq2Pyc1AVV0F8ADc5WmifHhiG9qyBFbpUBnKS2XTgttdXX-2F2WgQFGmAAnv4-2BXGnXeTeEGgzAvWR66RI4w-2BxbTp-2BVVHfOrH13b1GzTosdsNf4CLZpdY5wdIIcgKFNuNdaeQbGQjA7y8gLXwBH9vx7C1zzjvZ-2FhLGAjZzVg-2BGCVc5eLIhghDBl0ibr6LtqxDdL-2BTO4WMGDEbwiAXRs8L3c1rXwFjMjmQ2akli99ROfsftAraVXvDo-3DOtlK_Ps5uOjyCpFslDeso1wdwvvUwnAohiFunuIxA7lzd9uSfz-2BDPamfPG9hlmc9Y0GgV3tEeJ9fFWPEYmnno7uhvujziORgEF3ErUy4fxfnhPtV-2BfSCeOsmK4Y35mqUxtZzK-2B4QIUKU-2Bl58LikAAvRdQDTzOxqgU4bGHNQfCtDXBqhG6XMF70jG2SLJ5BecYaEO9PnVOlCd-2FaTVRDywjta-2Foz-2F0LBAVEP87HhFrNNibB533LPWMwxwJ0TULJu2ic-2FJFHJZzWLJxuu-2BDOJ1zeHBgjXFnQpGhu434zo-2BGf3gEW24yJmGJsPzHALg-2Fqt1OXdN96skLUNzusDnr2KZkG84zN17ReZloN-2FXJVTYXV5yu2Y-2Bs-3D" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7981341" data-affiliate="true"&gt;“Where the Shadows Dance: He Got Sober.

What worries physicians is that the earliest symptoms, often subtle and easily ignored, resemble simple tiredness or routine dehydration. As a result, many individuals get diagnosed only after sugar levels have significantly spiked.&lt;br&gt;According to multiple lifestyle-health analyses featured across major Indian publications, a majority of newly diagnosed diabetics reported feeling “unusually tired” for months before seeking a medical opinion.&lt;br&gt;“Most early signs of diabetes are so ordinary that they never raise suspicion. Patients think they are simply overworked or not sleeping enough, but the body is actually signalling impaired glucose control,” says Dr. Mohit Sharma, Amrita Hospital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 03:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>高血压药物自愿召回： FDA - NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/recalls/high-blood-pressure-med-recall/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The recommendation is especially important for those in high-risk groups, including pregnant women, children under 6 months of age, the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, or those who have not been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockland County Department of Health will offer free measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccines to residents six months and older. Look for the RCDOH Mobile Vaccination Van at the the site of the most recent exposure. The van will be in the parking lot at the Food Fair Wholesale Fresh Market on Monday, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious viruses on earth, according to health officials. Roughly 90 percent of the unvaccinated exposed to the virus become infected. You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, for up to 2 hours after that person is gone, and prior to an infected person even having a measles rash, RCDOH officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually appear 10-12 days after exposure, but may appear as early as seven days, and as late as 21 days after exposure. Severe illness and complications like pneumonia, encephalitis, hospitalization and death can occur in those who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To prevent the spread of illness, the department is advising thoses who have symptoms consistent with measles to contact their health care provider, a local clinic, or a local emergency department before going for care. This will help to protect others at these facilities from being exposed to illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMR vaccines are available at local health care providers, including Refuah Health, Sun River Health, or by calling the Rockland County Department of Health at 845-364-2497 or 845-364-2520.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more information and updated measles case counts, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.rocklandcountyny.gov/departments/health/communicable-diseases/measles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Rockland County Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;New York State Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; measles webpages. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 01:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNcFpGb000dEY3QWQtQzJ2SVZlN3B4TmJZbkxRSVJhaTQyWG5EelViYV94WG4zMkQ2ZkdDcFBHWGVHblZDRzhSai1SRi1rSUtTdGZod3k4aURBTTlPV1pxR01DLXRrUzlaczd1LWdjN1J3YWhvZXFBcG5tMzhNUng4RHVMNUR1TlFkcUhHeF9EZ0c4YXllTnd4M1R6Uzl2RU9CN3VxTmt30gHDAUFVX3lxTFBFVlN4Z3NEZm1qSjNrdjQ3WFllQTNsTlhBV05GM0tWQXp3aGthWXFHRDRPc094VHRfM0FHV292RTVnR3pSQmdkZzJJX21Sak9sdUNkUTh0cXdLdGhCdTN6Rm0xRndRemhGQXNzTnFoLWN2SDRGTU5KWEdBYUZwdWhoV3NZV0tWU0U5LXExQVRmMVdQSWs0VndPNUpDUWYwZzk0SHhOUHNuWEp3MjE4eUg4NnVZbEwydTVfc3Y5UFNxVU1fSQ</guid></item><item><title>这个常见的牙齿问题可能会威胁你的大脑- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/this-common-dental-problem-could-threaten-your-brain/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 01:02:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPX1VpRTI1dFRyd29aUWkzeUw4Y1FXN0JMTzFuaHJFQUtjUmJnT1RCdlFiTXh6UzNvT2lZV0hEZmN1dEJiQUJqMmxUZlJ4U3RQaWpxWHFDM0JETWFMaFRDeWE2QWtJMkg3c1pkWHlpSW5RWmY1YWFuZnBjM1kxeG0weEhacEY</guid></item><item><title>7种有助于逆转脂肪肝的desi食物：里面丢失的食谱-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/7-desi-foods-that-can-help-reverse-fatty-liver-lost-recipes-inside/photostory/125779827.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver creeps in quietly, no dramatic symptoms, no loud warning signs. Just a slow build-up of fat in a hardworking organ that rarely complains. Across India, doctors now call it one of the country’s fastest-growing lifestyle disorders, powered by long workdays, erratic meals, sugar sneaking into everything, and stress that never really leaves the room. But here’s the softer truth: the liver is one of the most forgiving organs. Give it the right food, the right rhythm, even for a few weeks, and it begins clearing the clutter on its own. And surprisingly, some of the most powerful foods to support this reset aren’t exotic supplements, they’re quiet, desi staples that have nourished families long before “fatty liver” became a headline. Below, seven Indian foods that help nudge the liver back to balance, along with little “lost recipe” ideas that bring them alive again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 23:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>一项新研究表明，常见的营养素缺乏可能会增加阿尔茨海默氏症的风险- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/choline-alzheimers-study-11862978</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choline is an essential micronutrient for a healthy brain and nervous system. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low blood choline levels are linked with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choline is found in seafood, meat, dairy, nuts, potatoes, legumes and whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choline is one of those underrated micronutrients we don’t hear much about—in fact, most Americans aren't eating enough of it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But every nutrient, no matter how micro, is essential—and choline is no exception. It’s necessary for a healthy brain and nervous system and helps regulate mood, memory and muscle control, plus it’s essential for forming the membranes surrounding your cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also vital for the proper brain development of babies in utero and after birth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides being underrated, choline is also a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diabetes-vitamin-deficiency-study-8784014" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;commonly deficient nutrient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And deficiency of this micronutrient comes with some potential harm. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/choline-dementia-study-8779484" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;one recent study linked low choline intake&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;higher risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, including the most common type of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Arizona, including Arizona State University and Mayo Clinic Arizona, set out to shed more light on the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;connection between choline and Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Aging and Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers wanted to compare choline levels in people with obesity to those with a healthy BMI. They state that previous studies suggest that people with obesity tend to have lower blood choline levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, a total of 30 participants, ages 29 to 36, were recruited: 15 (7 males, 8 females) with what is considered a healthy BMI (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2) and 15 (8 males, 7 females) with a BMI that is considered obese (&amp;gt;30 kg/m2). All participants were deemed healthy based on their medical history, routine physical examination, electrocardiogram, standard blood tests, and urinalysis. Participants were all nonsmokers, free of diabetes and had no history of liver, kidney or heart disease. They also took no prescription or over-the-counter medications or nutritional supplements, and were not engaging in a weight loss regimen. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Body composition was measured and fasting blood samples were collected. Researchers measured choline levels and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001377/having-diabetes-can-speed-up-cognitive-decline-here-are-5-things-you-can-do-to-help/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;factors related to diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, including glucose, HbA1c and insulin, as well as blood components associated with inflammation and cognitive decline. In addition, liver enzymes were measured, as certain ones can indicate dysfunctional sugar metabolism and brain nerve damage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, researchers also drew blood postmortem from people with known mild cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. With this, they could compare blood levels of the same components in the 30 healthy individuals with those of individuals with known Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, researchers found:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Individuals with obesity had lower levels of blood choline, which, in turn, were associated with poor metabolic markers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Markers of inflammation and liver enzymes were elevated in people with obesity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As choline levels in the blood decreased, neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of Alzheimer’s disease, increased. Higher levels of NfL suggest that damage to brain cells has occurred, and increases the risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, researchers found that obesity was associated with lower blood levels of choline, dysregulated inflammatory markers and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;elevated markers of metabolic dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;. And all of these factors are related to Alzheimer’s disease risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One major limitation of this study is that the dietary intake of choline was not assessed, so researchers cannot conclude whether people with obesity eat fewer choline-rich foods or if there’s some other factor involved concerning the lower levels. The number of participants for this study is considered moderate. Since more participants tend to increase the accuracy of the results, researchers note that larger sample sizes in the future will be helpful. This study also did not include cognitive assessments, so comparing blood work between the living participants and those who were post-mortem with cognitive decline should be interpreted with caution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you could supplement with choline, we believe it’s best to try to get your nutrients through food. Like most nutrients, choline is found in many foods, which is why we recommend eating a wide variety of foods to ensure you get all the nutrients you need. You’ll find choline in eggs, beef, poultry, pork, fish and dairy products. Cruciferous vegetables, soybeans (including tofu), shiitake mushrooms, peanuts, wheat germ, almonds, kidney beans, lima beans, red potatoes and quinoa are plant-based sources of choline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests a connection between low choline blood levels and Alzheimer’s disease. It also indicates a link between obesity and low choline, though researchers admit that they can’t yet say with confidence why this link exists. Many people are deficient in choline, despite it being found in a variety of foods. Evaluate your diet and start swapping ultra-processed foods with whole foods, like seafood, meats, dairy, nuts, eggs, legumes, cruciferous vegetables, potatoes and whole grains.

Here are three reasons why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small class="pGGCM2aD"&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often admire people who can handle everything on their own. We all know the one independent friend who seems unshakable, or we’ve come across an unnaturally &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/11/20/3-signs-you-are-too-independent-for-a-relationship-by-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/11/20/3-signs-you-are-too-independent-for-a-relationship-by-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="self-reliant partner"&gt;self-reliant partner&lt;/a&gt; or shared a cubicle with the colleague who never asks for help. And each time, we may have thought to ourselves, “How do they do it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-sufficiency feels like, and is often portrayed to be, a strength, but research suggests that overusing it might lead to diminishing returns. Relying on no one but yourself under all circumstances, especially in matters relating to your emotional or social life, can quietly erode your well-being, relationships and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might look like resilience from the outside may actually be a survival strategy with hidden costs. Additionally when we overvalue and abuse our personal resource of independence, we underuse the renewable and shared resource of connection in our lives, slowly but surely inching towards an inevitable burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three major ways excessive self-sufficiency can be harmful, backed by peer-reviewed research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;1. Being Too Self-Sufficient Can Lead To Isolation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social support, be it emotional, practical or relational, is a core human need that cannot be bargained with.  A large 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35576818/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35576818/" aria-label="meta-analysis"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35576818/"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combining 177 studies involving more than 113,000 people, found a strong negative relationship between perceived social support and feelings of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that when you habitually rely only on yourself, rejecting help or support even when you need it, you drastically increase your risk of loneliness. In turn, as a 2018 &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-018-1736-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-018-1736-5" aria-label="systematic review"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-018-1736-5"&gt;systematic review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, poor social support and loneliness predict worse outcomes for depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, someone who always over-functions might seem strong on the outside, but internally, this pattern sets the brain into chronic stress and deteriorating mental health. Over time, self-sufficiency can become social self-neglect, your mind pays the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your life’s problems become more stubborn when they’re being &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/08/28/2-ways-your-hyper-independence-is-making-you-lonely-by-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/08/28/2-ways-your-hyper-independence-is-making-you-lonely-by-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="fueled by isolation"&gt;fueled by isolation&lt;/a&gt;. And having people around who you love and can trust can make even the heaviest burdens feel lighter to carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;2. Being Too Self-Sufficient Can Lower Your Self-Esteem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1054857" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1054857" aria-label="Research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1054857"&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that perceived social support is a positive predictor of self-esteem and resilience. A meta-analysis of thousands of participants, including vulnerable youth, found that higher social support correlates with higher self-esteem, greater psychological resilience and lower loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you frequently decline help or avoid sharing burdens, you cut yourself off from the key resource that helps you regulate your emotional load. In essence, you reduce your ability to bounce back because resilience is often impossible to build alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, “self-management” abilities such as self-efficacy, initiative and mental flexibility can protect us against the negative consequences of emotional loneliness. But a crucial part of this self-management skillset is knowing when to draw on support and maintain one’s social connections. Pure self-reliance, and refusing help altogether, erases these protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, it reinforces the unhealthy belief that you have to handle everything alone, even when this belief leaves you weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;3. Being Too Self-Sufficient Can Isolate You In Your Darkest Moments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding reliance on others may also deprive you of emotional and practical buffers that mitigate stress. Extensive research links social isolation, loneliness and poor perceived support not only to mental-health struggles but also to physical health risks. For example, older adults with low social support have a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality compared to those with richer social ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social isolation and loneliness, as clarified by the 2018 review, are also associated with depression, anxiety, slower recovery from mental illness and poorer overall functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When self-sufficiency tips into social isolation, you are not just facing temporary stress. You are increasing your long-term risk of stress-related illness, deteriorating mental health and reduced life satisfaction. Many people don’t notice the risk because self-sufficiency often looks like stability until problems accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People push for self-reliance for many reasons, such as personality, upbringing, culture, social reward for independence or fear of being a burden. Over time, these factors create a mental framework that suppresses vulnerability as collateral, denying needs and treating connection as optional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-sufficiency can feel safer than asking for help and more reliable than hoping for others to step in. But research shows connection is essential, and that self-reliance can only get you halfway. Recovery, emotional regulation and resilience require more than personal grit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F7jc4VIvmUXU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7jc4VIvmUXU&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F7jc4VIvmUXU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;How To Stay Self-Sufficient Without Paying The Hidden Costs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you identify as someone who relies on themselves to their own detriment, here are research-informed ways to protect your well-being while maintaining independence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize when you are over-relying on yourself. &lt;/strong&gt;Signs include chronic fatigue, emotional numbness, withdrawal from relationships, mounting anxiety or irritability and difficulty asking for help. These are signs of depletion, and shouldn’t be misconstrued as signs of strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate social support, not just social contact. &lt;/strong&gt;Believing help is available protects against loneliness, depression and stress even when actual interaction is limited. Share small vulnerabilities, stay connected and show up for more than just yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View support as a resource, not a crutch. &lt;/strong&gt;Seeking help is not failure. In fact, it might just be the smarter and more adaptive decision to seek it in a tough spot. Support buffers stress and builds resilience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice balanced self-management. &lt;/strong&gt;Keep independence for personal goals, discipline, and boundaries, but maintain social resources. Balance autonomy with connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize quality relationships over lone heroics. &lt;/strong&gt;Trust, understanding and closeness matter more than a “self-made” narrative. Focus on a few deep, reliable relationships if you’re unable to keep up with a more full social circle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe vulnerability as strength. &lt;/strong&gt;Asking for help and admitting limits demonstrates emotional maturity. Real strength is flexibility and balance, not isolation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you too self-sufficient for your own good?

Rather than functioning like fixed files, memories consist of multiple components that can lie dormant until triggered by environmental cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When retrieved, these components blend with general knowledge, past experiences, and current context, creating updated versions of the original event. The findings help explain memory distortion and offer insights for mental health, learning, and legal settings where accuracy matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Memories:&lt;/strong&gt; Episodic memories are continually updated, not stored as perfect copies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger-Based Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; Hidden memory traces become conscious only when activated by cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory reshaping affects mental health, education, and legal decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study from the University of East Anglia is helping scientists better understand how our brains remember past events – and how those memories can change over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new paper published today explores episodic memory – the kind of memory we use to recall personal experiences like a birthday party or a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team say their work has important implications for mental health, education, and legal settings where memory plays a key role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working collaboratively with the University of Texas in Dallas, the team show that memories aren’t just stored like files in a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they’re made up of different parts. And while some are active and easy to recall, others stay hidden until something triggers them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the review shows that for something to count as a real memory, it must be linked to a real event from the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But even then, the memory we recall might not be a perfect copy,” said lead researcher Prof Louis Renoult, from UEA’s School of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can include extra details from our general knowledge, past experiences, or even the situation we’re in when we remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memories of older events often go through a process called re-encoding, which means the brain updates or reshapes the memory over time. This creates a chain of connections from the original experience to the version of the memory we can access now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work helps us understand why our memories aren’t always reliable and how they can be influenced by time, context, and even our own imaginations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the research happened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at almost 200 psychology and neuroscience studies about memory representations, as well philosophical papers and recent studies using animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Renoult said: “We wanted to suggest a new way of looking at things by combining ideas from different fields. The goal was to make sense of problems that haven’t been solved yet and spark fresh research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of the study focused on how the brain physically stores memories, highlighting the role of the hippocampus – a part of the brain that helps form and organise memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research explains how memory traces in the brain can lie dormant and only become conscious representations when something – typically a cue from the environment – activates that memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These conscious representations of our past are typically a combination of retrieved information of the original experience, generic knowledge about the world and information relevant for the current situation,” explained Prof Renoult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While memories need to have a causal link to past events to count as memories, they may differ each time they are retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that memories can and do change. They might become less accurate or include new information, making them feel different from the original event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A crucial part of our daily lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how memories are formed, stored, and reshaped over time is crucial because memory underpins so much of our daily lives – from learning and mental health to decisions made in courtrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By revealing that memories are dynamic rather than fixed, this research helps us better understand why they can change and how that impacts the way we think, feel, and act,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764972817388"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why do memories change over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Each retrieval blends original memory traces with generic knowledge and present context, reshaping the memory into a revised version of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764972819163"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What determines whether something is a “real” memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It must be causally linked to an actual past event, even though the recalled version may include altered or added details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764972818675"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is this research important for everyday life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding how memories evolve informs mental health treatment, supports better learning strategies, and highlights the limitations of eyewitness testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#64084a0c0b16100b0a241101054a05074a110f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Horton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uea.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Horton – University of East Anglia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The cognitive neuroscience of memory representations&lt;/a&gt;” by Louis Renoult et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroscience &amp;amp; Biobehavioral Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cognitive neuroscience of memory representations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present paper considers the cognitive neuroscience of memory from a representational perspective with the aim of shedding light on current empirical and theoretical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We focus on episodic memory, differentiating active versus latent, and cognitive versus neural memory representations. We adopt a causal perspective, according to which a memory representation must have a causal connection to a past event to count as a memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We note that retrieved episodic information may nonetheless only partially determine the content of an active memory representation, which can comprise a combination of the retrieved information with semantic, schematic and situational information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We further note that, especially in the case of memories for temporally remote events, re-encoding operations likely lead to a causal chain that extends from the original experience of the event to its currently accessible memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss how the reinstatement framework provides a mechanistic basis for the causal linkage between an experience, the memory trace encoding it, and the episodic memory of the experience, highlighting the crucial role of hippocampal engrams in encoding patterns of neocortical activity that, when active, constitute the neural representation of an episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we discuss some of the ways in which a memory can become modified and hence distanced from the episode that precipitated it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 22:21:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9KV2lVbjlyV2cwcFBUOUpMc1BFaHZBRjJmQ1RUQlZGdi1PTGJkQ2w5LVAxcG41MzlOajZueTZLR2hydDI2al9DeDJodmwtMnN5XzA0SFoyeDNyV3F4MDhzcVJ5OXVndVhFOUE</guid></item></channel></rss>
