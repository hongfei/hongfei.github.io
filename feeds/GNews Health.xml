(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to manage medium-level anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of anxiety like a volume knob,” Dr Warrier explains. “It can be at a low level, where it’s almost like a whisper. It can be at a medium level, where you know it’s there. Or it can be at a very high level, where it’s screaming.” For low-level &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/anxiety" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, simple techniques like deep breathing or stretching can help. “Even basic practices such as box breathing or slow exhalation can calm your nervous system. In a way, it’s telling your body that you are safe,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When anxiety rises to a medium level, manifesting as restlessness or feeling on edge, Dr Warrier recommends grounding techniques. “Connect with your body’s sensory system. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can taste, and one thing you can smell.&lt;/span&gt; This brings you back to your body and helps you calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other strategies for medium-level anxiety include a quick body scan to check in with each part of your body or taking a walk. “The rhythmic action of walking can also help calm your nervous system,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do during high-level anxiety or panic attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-level anxiety, such as during a panic attack or overwhelming stress, requires a more immediate intervention. “This is where you need a slight shock to reset your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-warns-hands-shaking-slurred-speech-are-signs-of-nervous-system-disorders-5-symptoms-you-should-not-ignore-101761714665596.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="nervous system"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, either by splashing cold water on your face or keeping an ice cube in your mouth. Cold water activates the mammalian dive reflex, which brings down your heart rate, stimulates the vagus nerve, and calms you down,” explains Dr Warrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By understanding the intensity of anxiety and using the right technique for each level, it becomes easier to regain control and calm the nervous system. As Dr Warrier notes, “Different levels of anxiety need different tools. The key is to match your response to your body’s needs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

reported that a resident in South Lake Tahoe suffered an infection of the plague caused by a suspected flea bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; plague. The same disease that wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century has never been eradicated. It's caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is spread to animals by fleas. A handful of cases are reported in the United States each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease spread to the U.S. in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early 1900s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;early 1900s&lt;/a&gt; likely via an infected rodent on a steamship. There hasn't been an urban case reported in over a century, though &lt;a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/operation-cherry-blossoms-night.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:San Diego;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; had a lucky escape in 1945 when World War II ended before a planned biological attack by the Japanese could be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most common variant is the bubonic plague, characterized by fever, cramps, and painful swelling of the lymph nodes. If untreated, the infection can spread to the lungs (pneumonic) or the whole body (septicemic), which is almost always fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking, and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present," warned Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County acting director of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is a plague case concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The plague is &lt;a href="https://netec.org/2024/03/25/climate-change-and-infectious-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a vector-borne disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a vector-borne disease&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it is transmitted to humans via the bites of infected vectors such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. As the heat-trapping pollution produced by human activity causes global temperatures to rise, it creates the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A warmer planet means longer breeding seasons for vectors and extends their ranges. For example, infections of dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, are skyrocketing across Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about the plague?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, doctors are adept at treating the plague, provided it is caught quickly enough. A round of antibiotics administered early on will cure the infection, so it's important to help &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/talk-climate-with-your-family-and-friends/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spread awareness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spread awareness&lt;/a&gt; of the warning signs. If, after a hike or camping trip in an at-risk area such as the Sierra Nevadas, you experience fever and tender lymph nodes, get medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The California Department of Public Health also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/pages/plague.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sensible precautions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sensible precautions&lt;/a&gt;, such as being mindful of warnings, keeping food secure, staying away from burrows, and treating pets with flea control products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec0kDXxEpBFluF7O" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPSDJhS0MtM0xHdXRxRWpuRFZOd1o4b29FN3ZFbU5HUzliS0JKc1lTRXpPbGJMM0NRRXZWUGdEajN0em1xNHdwQ2p2VUVvRnBRYkF4bEVLdjJOaXJZMlpBYTBFb1RHWVh5VmE0R3RQYWhNZFZiNGtxSXhrMTJHSDhkZ09neUtwQUR1RjNsYUF2WXY</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，超加工食品与每个主要人体器官的伤害有关-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/18/ultra-processed-food-linked-to-harm-in-every-major-human-organ-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultra-processed food (UPF) is linked to harm in every major organ system of the human body and poses a seismic threat to global health, according to the world’s largest review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UPF is also rapidly displacing fresh food in the diets of children and adults on every continent, and is associated with an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/28/ultra-processed-food-increases-risk-of-early-death-international-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased risk of a dozen health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The sharp rise in UPF intake worldwide is being spurred by profit-driven corporations using a range of aggressive tactics to drive consumption, skewer scientific debate and prevent regulation, the review of evidence suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;from a series of three papers published in the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, come as millions of people increasingly consume UPF such as ready meals, cereals, protein bars, fizzy drinks and fast food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK and US, more than half the average diet now consists of UPF. For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evidence reviewed by 43 of the world’s leading experts suggests that diets high in UPF are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A systematic review of 104 long-term studies &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;conducted for the series&lt;/a&gt; found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, and early death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the Lancet series authors, Prof Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, said the findings underlined why urgent action is needed to tackle UPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body. The evidence strongly suggests that humans are not biologically adapted to consume them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He and his colleagues in Brazil came up with the Nova classification system for foods. It groups them by level of processing, ranging from one – unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables – to four: ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This category is made up of products that have been industrially manufactured, often using artificial flavours, emulsifiers and colouring. They include soft drinks and packaged snacks, and tend to be extremely palatable and high in calories but low in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also designed and marketed to displace fresh food and traditional meals, while maximising corporate profits, Monteiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critics argue UPF is an ill-defined category and existing health policies, such as those aimed at reducing sugar and salt consumption, are sufficient to deal with the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Monteiro and his co-authors acknowledged valid scientific critiques of Nova and UPF – such as lack of long-term clinical and community trials, an emerging understanding of mechanisms, and the existence of subgroups with different nutritional values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, they argued future research must not delay immediate action to tackle the scourge of UPF, which they say is justified by the current evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals,” Monteiro warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/uk-government-drops-healthy-eating-push-after-lobbying-by-ultra-processed-food-firms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extensive marketing and political lobbying&lt;/a&gt; to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The second paper in the series proposes policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing and consumption. Although some countries have brought in rules to reformulate foods and control UPF, “the global public health response is still nascent, akin to where the tobacco control movement was decades ago”, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The third paper says that global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPF. UPF is a leading cause of the “chronic disease pandemic” linked to diet, with food companies putting profit above all else, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The main barrier to protecting health is “corporate political activities, coordinated transnationally through a global network of front groups, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and research partners, to counter opposition and block regulation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Series co-author Prof Barry Popkin, from the University of North Carolina, said: “We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also proposed stronger marketing restrictions, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/22/uk-ban-on-junk-food-adverts-targeting-children-is-delayed-until-next-year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adverts aimed at children, as well as banning UPF in public places such as schools&lt;/a&gt; and hospitals and putting limits on UPF sales and shelf space in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One success story is Brazil’s national school food programme, which has eliminated most UPF and will require 90% of food to be fresh or minimally processed by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists not involved in the series broadly welcomed the review of evidence but also called for more research into UPF, cautioning that association with health harm may not mean causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQYTY2WWw2Yi00SlJfSllFS09FajVTSGpDX29pMDlQd2JCMy1pMXpiQ2J0NnFuVzZfNE5FcW81WlU3M3JtYUpaWW9ram1ub0RjNy1kNloxU1JJOG9jSy1XRXNLWGNjMURBa3l2S1BkdXRUeXVGOEZQdU4wZDVLU05OYXFqaFpkRGVKT0laUDczRmEzRWxoY0E1NzhDZW5BODQwWEd5S1JSYl90UEwwWkQ2dUlUazUzVEFXWFVvSmFPdw</guid></item><item><title>听力障碍？伟哥可以逆转一些耳聋：研究-纽约邮报</title><link>https://nypost.com/2025/11/18/health/hard-of-hearing-viagra-could-reverse-some-deafness-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/192090" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A new study reports&lt;/a&gt; that Viagra has the potential to reverse a frequently permanent type of inherited hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201694" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;3 in 2,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are born with auditory impairments. The good news is that popping a Viagra could come with a surprising perk beyond the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/192090" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/a&gt; highlighted a mutation in a gene called CPD, which results in a form of deafness known as sensorineural hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Chicago, the University of Miami and several institutions in Turkey uncovered that the condition could be targeted by two treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One is a common supplement, while the other is the popular erectile dysfunction drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study is exciting because we found a new gene mutation that’s linked to deafness, and more importantly, we have a therapeutic target that can actually mitigate this condition,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://neurology.uchicago.edu/faculty/rong-zhai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rong Grace Zhai&lt;/a&gt;, a neurological diseases professor at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One treatment was sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra and other&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" rel="nofollow" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt; ED medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In healthy hearing, the CPD gene instructs an enzyme to maintain levels of the amino acid arginine, which produces nitric oxide, helping send signals through the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the CPD gene pathway is disrupted, causing oxidative stress and cell death in the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear hair cells&lt;/a&gt; responsible for hearing and balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the ear loses the function of the CPD gene, the ability to detect sound waves goes too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study authors addressed this loss in two ways using fruit flies with CPD mutations: sildenafil to stimulate nitric oxide production and a separate &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/vitamin-supplements-could-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-doctor/"&gt;arginine supplement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Both treatments improved hearing loss in the flies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that CPD maintains the level of arginine in the hair cells to allow a quick signaling cascade by generating nitric oxide,” Zhai explained. “These hair cells in particular are more sensitive or vulnerable to the loss of CPD.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids and cochlear implants, though the initial study results may lead to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found a promising therapeutic avenue for these patients,” said Zhai. “It is a good example of our efforts to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for treating rare diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unsurprising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 9171 subtype “continues, unfortunately uninterrupted, across multiple jurisdictions,” David Sugerman, who leads the CDC measles response, said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, local health officials are pessimistic that they’ll be able to stamp out the virus’ spread, saying that vaccination efforts have had “limited” impact. As Ars reported previously, vaccination rates are dangerously low in two measles hotspots: northwestern Mohave County, Arizona, and the southwest health district of Utah. Vaccination rates among kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year were 78.4 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively. That’s well below the 95 percent target needed to keep the virus from spreading onward in the communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, public health officials in Arizona and Utah have reported barriers to responding to the outbreak. Around a quarter of cases don’t know how they were exposed, suggesting cases and exposures are being missed. In late October, health officials in Salt Lake County, Utah, said that a person likely infected with measles &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/"&gt;refused to cooperate&lt;/a&gt; with their investigation, leaving them unable to confirm the probable case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kimberlin, who sits on a panel of experts that analyzes measles data for the United States’ elimination status review, told the Times, “It would not surprise me in the least if there’s continued spread across these next several months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the CDC  has tallied 1,723 measles cases across 42 states. Most (87 percent) of those cases were linked to outbreaks, of which there have been 45 this year. For context, there were 16 outbreaks and a total of 285 measles cases in the US last year. This year’s measles cases mark a 33-year high.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Dr Handuo Shi said in a statement: ‘In other words, drugs don’t just kill bacteria; they also reshuffle the "buffet" in our gut, and that reshuffling shapes which bacteria win.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr KC Huang, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford, and lead researcher, added: ‘Understanding how microbes are competing for food ends up telling a really large part of this collateral damage story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It enables us to predict who is going to live, who is going to die, and makes the ensuing chaos seem really intuitive. I think that’s what we’re most excited about.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team took a human fecal sample, used it to colonize a mouse, and then used its gut contents to create a stable microbial community that they could grow in a lab dish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacterial community in their guts contained dozens of different species interacting as they would in a human gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they exposed the mice to 707 different drugs, one per experiment, all at the same concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After growing over a dozen communities of bacteria with the drugs, they tested how many of those communities of bacteria survived after being introduced to the medications, the nutrients and waste products left behind from dying strains and measured the overall growth of the community as a whole to see how much each drug inhibited it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was diagnosed with 'aggressive' stage three colon cancer at 28. He told DailyMail.com if he had not had routine bloodwork done for baseball, he may not have been diagnosed 'until it was too late'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key example researchers found pertained to two beneficial bacterial species, which survived in a test tube when exposed to the antifungal drug bifonazole. The bacteria rely on an iron-containing molecule called heme for food, which scientists added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the gut, these same bacteria do not get their heme directly and must rely on other bacteria to produce and supply it. The antifungal drug, however, killed the bacteria that usually provide this crucial compound, &lt;span&gt;cutting off the species' food supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suddenly starved and weakened, the beneficial bacterial species became vulnerable to a drug they could previously resist, allowing harmful strains of bacteria to take up the leftover nutrients and flourish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damage caused by the 141 drugs that wiped out entire communities of bacteria was often permanent, with communities failing to return to their original states after the drugs were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resulting imbalance creates a state of chronic inflammation in the gut, which can damage colon cell DNA and fuel processes that lead to colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalanced microbiome also disrupts the mucosal barrier lining the intestines, allowing toxins and other harmful substances to leak into the intestinal tissue, which further fuels constant low-grade inflammation and spurs the development and clumping of cancer cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An imbalance, also known as dysbiosis, can produce harmful waste and byproducts known to promote cancer, including colibactin produced by certain E. coli bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colibactin damages the DNA of colon cells, leading to mutations that influence the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a key example, two Bacteroides species were resistant to a an antifungal drug in a test tube when given a vital iron molecule (heme). But in the gut community, they relied on other bacteria for this. The drug disrupted the supply, starving them of heme. The graph lines represent the abundance of different bacterial species as the drug concentration increased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors across the US have been sounding the alarm for years about a rising number of bacterial strains that have become resistant to common antibiotics, requiring high doses of less commonly used drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drug-resistant infections have since been dubbed ‘superbugs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society's most recent investigation revealed a dramatic surge in colorectal cancer among adults under 55, with diagnoses in 45- to 49-year-olds accelerating from a one percent annual increase before 2019 to a 12 percent yearly rise through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate analysis posited that colon cancer is among the fastest-growing cancers in young adults, particularly 20 to 29-year-olds, where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;cases are surging by 2.4&lt;/a&gt; percent per year on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has already been projected to become the most common cancer in people under 50 by the year 2030.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team’s work gives other scientists a tool to predict a drug's impact on gut bacteria, opening the door to strategies that protect or rapidly rebuild a healthy microbiome after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shi said: ‘Our study pushes a shift from thinking of drugs as acting on a single microbe to thinking of them as acting on an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can understand and model the ecosystem response, we could one day choose drugs and accompanying diets or probiotics not only based on how well they treat a disease, but also on how they preserve or promote a healthy microbiome.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01243-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425012437%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study has uncovered microscopic abnormalities in the blood of long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients&lt;/strong&gt; that may help explain the condition’s lingering symptoms. These hidden structures, discovered through advanced imaging techniques, show a significant departure from typical blood composition. The findings could reshape how we understand and diagnose long COVID. And if confirmed, they might finally provide a tangible target for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Microclots And Immune Webs: Unseen Triggers Behind Lingering Illness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the hunt for what fuels &lt;strong&gt;long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;—a condition that continues to puzzle scientists years after the pandemic began—a team of international researchers has turned its attention to the blood. Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70613" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, reveal that people suffering from long COVID consistently show an unusually high presence of two little-known but potentially harmful agents: &lt;em&gt;microclots&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;neutrophil extracellular traps&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;NETs&lt;/em&gt;. These substances, although naturally occurring, appear to become harmful when they accumulate and interact in excessive or abnormal ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are not the types of blood clots you’d see in a stroke or pulmonary embolism,” explains Dr. Alain Thierry, lead author of the study and a geneticist at &lt;strong&gt;Montpellier University&lt;/strong&gt; in France. Instead, they are much smaller—microscopic in fact—yet significant enough to disrupt blood flow in tiny vessels, particularly in areas like the brain, muscles, and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used &lt;strong&gt;imaging flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy&lt;/strong&gt; on blood samples from 50 long COVID patients and 38 healthy individuals. They found that microclots were nearly 20 times more abundant in those with long COVID—and, more surprisingly, that NETs were not just floating freely, but were physically embedded within the microclots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a robust association between biomarkers indicative of thromboinflammatory activity and long COVID,” the team writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They propose that this entanglement of NETs and clots forms structures that are resistant to the body’s natural blood-clearing processes, a disruption that could directly explain symptoms such as &lt;em&gt;brain fog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;chronic pain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When The Immune System Traps Itself: How The Body’s Defenses May Turn Against It&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NETs are normally part of the immune system’s frontline defense. These sticky webs of DNA and enzymes, released by white blood cells, trap invading pathogens before they can spread. In typical cases, NETs are quickly dissolved after doing their job. But in long &lt;strong&gt;COVID patients,&lt;/strong&gt; researchers found that NETs lingered in large quantities, intertwining with microclots and potentially amplifying the damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of these biomarker linkages not only presents a possible novel diagnostic methodology,” the authors write, “but also novel therapeutic targets, offering prospects for future markedly improved clinical management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While both microclots and NETs had been previously observed separately in other diseases, their &lt;strong&gt;combined presence and physical interaction&lt;/strong&gt; in long COVID patients marks a striking new insight. This synergy may explain why some people develop persistent symptoms long after the infection has cleared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This finding suggests the existence of underlying physiological interactions between microclots and NETs that, when dysregulated, may become pathogenic,” says Thierry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; In other words, the body’s own immune response may be creating self-sustaining, harmful blood structures that prolong illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could also help explain why standard diagnostic tests often fail to detect long COVID—these interactions happen at a microscopic level and wouldn’t necessarily show up on conventional scans or blood work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward A Blood-Based Test? AI Models See The Invisible&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more remarkable aspects of the study was the use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/asian-militaries-and-artificial-intelligence/" data-type="post" data-id="42190"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to analyze anonymized blood samples. The AI was able to correctly identify long COVID patients with 91% accuracy based solely on the presence and patterns of microclots and NETs. This raises the possibility of developing a reliable &lt;strong&gt;diagnostic blood test&lt;/strong&gt; for a condition that has, until now, largely been diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could transform how doctors screen for and manage long COVID, and even open the door to personalized treatments aimed at breaking down these resistant structures in the blood. Clinical applications are still a long way off, but this research offers a promising roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the authors caution that more research is needed to prove causation—not just correlation—the patterns they uncovered mark a significant leap forward. If confirmed by future studies, the blood of long COVID patients may hold the key not only to diagnosis but to treatment strategies that could finally bring relief to millions.&lt;/p&gt;

However, researchers say it takes time for the body to recover and reach the level of someone who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Tasdighi emphasized that this doesn't mean cessation doesn't have immediate effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's important that people know that when they stop smoking, their risk goes down immediately and significantly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Miao agreed, adding that the study's most important takeaway is that "it's important to quit smoking early on, and no amount of smoking is without risk and health consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's not just patients who should heed the results of this study, the authors stressed. Physicians should also consider changing the way they inquire about smoking because the number of packs someone smokes per year is not necessarily predictive of long-term health risks, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Clinicians need a more nuanced approach that incorporates other ways to identify and quantify cigarette use, like smoking status and smoking intensity," Miao said, noting that whether it's smoking one cigarette a day or one a week, no amount of smoking is safe, and quitting remains the best thing someone can do for their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;To learn more about quitting smoking, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or make an appointment with your health care provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Radhika Malhotra, MD, is an internal medicine-preventive medicine resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 19:07:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOMGhZajNuWk5yWWhsOWJwbW85eG94Q3FZcE1IaDVzY3hEQnl2d0tNWXVveEYtUmF5cGpMYjQ3b2hfTExyeTNEM1VPT2VFclE5b3ZiZ183THBZYjZ4cWRIclg0a0p2VEhRd3prZFMzS2JnWXNsNm5PTWZPSGR6SVdaWExZNEVtUGFuZ1pUM3FfWFFKUGZlRXNXWDhzLVpyNkx5QkowTVc1dnhTUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOQjBmdDZlOUstQmZJejA3VDVMZXBGcDlxWFhacFdES19Bc0lvdGR3dThKQ2ZRbVpqY3dRdi1ielM2NVlvaUd5WmZyU1ZXZzExY2twbUNwNzJuNzd1OU9yZktxamNLSVNqR1gwTHluNWRKV2VBSTdyZF9fMm1NSnI2UERTYkgyRDRGUGFYZFJnUWVLREY3STZQNnltQS1ab2hZX1J3YXlzSHBmVk5IaDhN</guid></item><item><title>微塑料严重影响男性动脉-加州大学河滨分校</title><link>https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/11/18/microplastics-hit-male-arteries-hard</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025006890#ak005"&gt;mouse study&lt;/a&gt; led by University of California, Riverside biomedical scientists suggests that everyday exposure to microplastics — tiny fragments shed from packaging, clothing, and countless plastic products — may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, the artery-clogging process that leads to heart attacks and strokes. The harmful effects were seen only in male mice, offering new clues about how microplastics may affect cardiovascular health in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="embedded-entity align-left"&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Changcheng Zhou&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Our findings fit into a broader pattern seen in cardiovascular research, where males and females often respond differently,” said lead researcher &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/changchz"&gt;Changcheng Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biomedical sciences in the UCR &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucr.edu/"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. “Although the precise mechanism isn’t yet known, factors like sex chromosomes and hormones, particularly the protective effects of estrogen, may play a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are now found nearly everywhere: in food, water, the air, and even inside the human body. Recent human studies have detected microplastics in atherosclerotic plaques and linked higher levels to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, scientists didn’t understand whether or how microplastics directly contribute to artery damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely,” Zhou said. “Still, the best strategy is to reduce exposure by limiting plastic use in food and water containers, reducing single-use plastics, and avoiding highly-processed foods. There are currently no effective ways to remove microplastics from the body, so minimizing exposure and maintaining overall cardiovascular health — through diet, exercise, and managing risk factors — remains essential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in Environment International, Zhou and his team report their use of a well-established mouse model for studying heart disease: LDLR-deficient mice, which are prone to developing atherosclerosis. They fed both male and female mice a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, similar to a lean, healthy person’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then gave the mice a daily dose of microplastics (10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) for nine weeks at levels considered environmentally relevant and similar to what humans may encounter through contaminated food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found microplastics dramatically worsened atherosclerosis, but only in males. In male mice, microplastic exposure increased plaque buildup by 63% in the aortic root, the first section of the aorta that attaches to the heart; and 624% in the brachiocephalic artery, a blood vessel that branches off the aorta in the upper chest. In female mice, the same exposure did not significantly worsen plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found microplastics did not make the mice obese or raise their cholesterol. The mice remained lean, and their blood lipid levels did not change, meaning the increased artery damage was not due to traditional risk factors like weight gain or high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found microplastics altered key cells that line the arteries. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, a technology that helps identify which genes are expressed in each cell and at what level, the team found that microplastics disrupted the activity and proportions of several types of cells involved in atherosclerosis, especially endothelial cells — the cells that line blood vessels and regulate inflammation and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found endothelial cells were the most affected by microplastic exposure,” Zhou said. “Since endothelial cells are the first to encounter circulating microplastics, their dysfunction can initiate inflammation and plaque formation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the team’s experiments, fluorescent microplastics were found to enter plaques and localize within the endothelial layer — findings consistent with recent human studies showing microplastics in arterial lesions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another finding the researchers report from their experiments is that microplastics triggered harmful gene activity in both mouse and human endothelial cells. Exposure to microplastics was found to activate pro-atherogenic (plaque-promoting) genes in endothelial cells from mice and humans, suggesting a shared biological response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides some of the strongest evidence so far that microplastics may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease, not just correlate with it,” Zhou said. “The surprising sex-specific effect — harming males but not females — could help researchers uncover protective factors or mechanisms that differ between men and women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou and his team acknowledge that more research is needed to understand why males are more vulnerable. The researchers plan to perform studies to determine if similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would like to investigate how different types or sizes of microplastics affect vascular cells,” Zhou said. “We will also look into the molecular mechanisms behind endothelial dysfunction and explore how microplastics affect male and female arteries differently. As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou was joined in the study by colleagues at UCR, Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, and the University of New Mexico Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was partially supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

While most HPV infections clear on their own, there are more than 200 strains of the virus, and about 14 are known to cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The CDC &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/index.html"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; nearly all &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;sexually&lt;/a&gt; active people will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives, and about 10 per cent of men and 3.6 per cent of women are known to have it. Many people clear the virus within one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It can take decades, however, for the infection to actually cause &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the back of the throat, known as throat cancer, or oropharyngeal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Michael Douglas was &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-hpv-453877-20250807"&gt;diagnosed with throat cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, and although the actor said publicly that the stage four disease was possibly &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-causes-678858-20250807"&gt;linked to oral sex&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/film"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; star acknowledged other risk factors like being a smoker and a drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Men who have sex with other men 'have higher risk than straight men' (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are men more likely to be diagnosed with HPV cancer than women?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Around two in three new HPV-related head and neck cancer cases in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; are in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Karis Betts, a cancer epidemiologist from Cancer Research UK, told LADbible that 'it can take decades' for HPV to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;On why men often face higher rates of HPV cancers, the expert further explained: “There are studies that look at risk for different people. Straight women who have sex with men have a higher risk than women who have sex exclusively with women. And men who have sex with men have higher risk than straight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The HPV vaccine is also available up to age 40 for men who have sex with men because the risk is slightly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Nearly one in 96 UK females and one in 43 UK males will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer in their lifetime (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Men have higher rates of head and neck cancers than women. This kind of historically links to other risk factors as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“If you look a few decades ago, there were really high rates of smoking in men, high rates of alcohol, and they’ve consistently been higher than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Men have higher rates of head and neck cancers, particularly in the mouth and throat, and these cancers are also caused by other things that are more prevalent in men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She stressed that 'smoking and alcohol are going to be much bigger drivers of head and neck cancers than HPV'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Men are diagnosed with HPV cancer more than women (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid HPV-related throat cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;HPV spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex, touching, and sharing sex toys. While condoms can help, 'they’re not 100 percent effective'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The big kind of preventable measures against HPV in the population are vaccination and cervical screening,” Betts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Vaccines kind of work best, and that's why they work best at that school age, because it's before people have had any exposure to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“If people are worried about their cancer risk, the best things that they can do, especially for head and neck cancer, is to not smoke, or stop smoking, and reduce their alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Things like that will have a much bigger benefit on your cancer risk than kind of worrying about an HPV infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She stressed that 'the advice isn’t going to be stop having sex', adding: "People should live and enjoy their lives, and sex is part of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Head and neck cancer accounts for three percent of all new cancer cases in the UK (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of throat cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12180-oropharyngeal-cancer"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; the Cleveland Clinic, symptoms and causes of throat cancer include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list_list__njBdr"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or difficulty swallowing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble opening your mouth or moving your tongue fully&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constant or unexplained ear pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump in the back of the throat or inside the mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump or swelling in the neck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A white patch on the tongue or inside the mouth that doesn’t disappear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’ve been affected by any of these issues and want to speak to someone in confidence, contact Macmillan’s Cancer Support Line on 0808 808 00 00, 8am–8pm seven days a week&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:17:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNX1dBY1poVW5mMnZmZGJjX2tVZGtsT0RTbEVNNEcxMzZ1d2Uyd0UtNzFoOUZlTGdMWlhhN2dNYU51VUNMenJwRXhWNFJZOVY0UEhiSUo1S3dacGl3NlQyTkRTb2dVeDFSdm1yOTNUWDN0X2FQRnNRM0NpSzdMRnM1SWlzeFRDQnZCTmNIQ1FPTF9SMzMzQ3hSMjF2dzFPS3Zy</guid></item><item><title>锻炼肌肉需要多长时间？这是事实- GQ</title><link>https://www.gq.com/story/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-muscle-2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How long does it take to build muscle&lt;/em&gt; is not, of course, a question with a simple answer, despite what the TikToks or Reels promising to unlock the one thing you need to get big might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they tend to raise many more questions: Like, should you be fasting? Or should you be cutting out cardio, relying solely on supersets, smashing calisthenics, attending military bootcamps, doing everything on the bosu ball, using only kettlebells, taking protein immediately after your workout, nailing creatine, eating lots and lots of beef, training at a specific heart rate, squatting with your partner on your shoulders, performing every workout without your top on, or adding a resistance band to absolutely everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of suggestions goes on. There’s a gym obsession for everyone, but none of it will get you in shape the way that focusing on the (somewhat less sexy) essentials will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's go back to basics. This is the only information you really need to tackle the perennial question: how long does it take to build muscle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we actually build muscle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of building muscle is known as &lt;em&gt;hypertrophy&lt;/em&gt;. We enter hypertrophy when we apply tension to our muscles during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This tension stimulates a cascade of biological signals in the body which leads to an increase in muscle protein synthesis, a process during which new proteins are produced and integrated into the muscle fibers, leading to larger and stronger muscles,” explains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/clubqhealth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Harry Cox&lt;/a&gt;, founder of London’s high-end &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.clubqhealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.clubqhealth.com/"}' href="https://www.clubqhealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Club Q Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we actually do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resistance training&lt;/em&gt; is a great way to build muscle in the gym. Essentially, this means moving your body with weights to make those movements harder. A bicep curl with a dumbbell is harder than it would be with no weight, for instance. This is resistance training. The heavier the weight—or greater the resistance—the more our muscles are forced to adapt, making them grow stronger over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do it right and you can build muscle by weight training as little as two to three times a week, according to fitness expert &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pennyweston.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pennyweston.com/"}' href="https://pennyweston.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Weston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should always make sure to increase your weights to push yourself and ensure you are creating as much resistance, and therefore muscle trauma, as possible,” she says, referring to a method called &lt;em&gt;progressive overload&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To progressively overload your muscles, you’ll want to go heavier on at least two out of your four sets per exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:05:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE4wUFZpbGY2d3o2QVFkYWRjVVJlRDg3WTJFZjUxOHYzVFEyVk5mZUJBZldaY3dGZzEzMUJ5LVY1d0FCM3NfcGFNQlBqdU1OU3hfckxWb1RIcENJSjQxYTd3Y3FsaHc4czdMWFdMdGhObDF3Zw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现二甲双胍可能阻碍关键的运动益处- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251117095648.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A widely used medication for diabetes prevention may unexpectedly interfere with one of the most reliable ways to lower disease risk: regular physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rutgers-led team reported in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; that metformin appeared to weaken several important benefits normally gained from exercise. These include improvements in blood vessel function, overall fitness and the body's ability to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, medical guidance has encouraged people with elevated blood sugar to combine metformin with consistent exercise. The expectation was that two well-established treatments would reinforce one another. According to the Rutgers researchers, the evidence suggests a different outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most health care providers assume one plus one equals two," said Steven Malin, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health in the School of Arts and Sciences and the lead author of the study. "The problem is that most evidence shows metformin blunts exercise benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Tested Metformin's Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this issue, Malin and his colleagues enrolled 72 adults considered at risk for metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of conditions known to raise the likelihood of both diabetes and heart disease. Participants were separated into four groups: high-intensity exercise with placebo, high-intensity exercise with metformin, low-intensity exercise with placebo and low-intensity exercise with metformin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a 16-week training period, the research team measured how well participants' blood vessels responded to insulin. This response helps vessels widen and deliver oxygen, hormones and nutrients after eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that exercise alone strengthened vascular insulin sensitivity. Blood vessels became more responsive to insulin, allowing greater blood flow to the muscles. This is important because insulin-assisted dilation helps move glucose from the bloodstream into body tissues, lowering blood sugar after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metformin Significantly Reduced Expected Gains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When metformin was added, these improvements became noticeably smaller. The medication also appeared to limit gains in aerobic capacity and lessen positive changes in inflammation and fasting blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Blood vessel function improved with exercise training, regardless of intensity," Malin said. "Metformin blunted that observation, suggesting one type of exercise intensity is not better either with the drug for blood vessel health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are concerning because exercise is intended to support healthy blood sugar levels and improve physical capability. If metformin reduces these effects, patients relying on both may not receive the degree of protection they expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you exercise and take metformin and your blood glucose does not go down, that's a problem," Malin said. "People taking metformin also didn't gain fitness. That means their physical function isn't getting better and that could have long-term health risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Life Consequences for Daily Function and Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malin noted that exercise-driven fitness improvements influence everyday activities such as climbing stairs, playing with children or maintaining an active social life. If these gains are diminished, overall quality of life can suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that the findings should not prompt anyone to stop taking metformin or abandon exercise. Instead, the study highlights the need for physicians to closely consider how these interventions interact and to monitor patient progress. Malin hopes that future studies will help identify approaches that preserve the positive effects of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Metformin May Interfere With Exercise Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason metformin dampens exercise benefits is still being investigated. Malin explained that metformin partly works by inhibiting specific mitochondrial processes. This action reduces oxidative stress and helps regulate blood sugar. However, the same interference may block the cellular changes typically triggered by exercise, including better mitochondrial efficiency and improved aerobic performance. In essence, the mechanism that makes metformin effective may also hinder the body's ability to fully respond to physical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have suggested a similar pattern, but this trial is one of the first to look closely at vascular insulin sensitivity, a key factor in both glucose control and cardiovascular health. By demonstrating that metformin can limit changes in both major arteries and small capillaries across different exercise intensities, the researchers highlight how complex these combined treatments can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Diabetes Prevention and Clinical Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malin pointed out that nearly 35 million people in the United States live with type 2 diabetes, and prevention strategies often depend on a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. If these approaches do not work together as expected, long-term risks may increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to figure out how to best recommend exercise with metformin," Malin said. "We also need to consider how other medications interact with exercise to develop better guidelines for doctors to help people lower chronic disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;

This suggests that we may be able to develop treatment or prevention strategies that are helpful for young people with a range of common disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dIewYy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/20/Pulled_Into_MRI_Machine_77994.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The findings are significant because they suggest that mental health disorders should not be studied in isolation as they traditionally are" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-569078"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The findings are significant because they suggest that mental health disorders should not be studied in isolation as they traditionally are&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that girls and boys are more alike than previously thought, as both experienced similar changes in brain structure with the same mental health disorders. This was surprising given that previous, albeit much smaller, studies had suggested that girls and boys with the same disorder might show different changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is despite considerable evidence showing ADHD and conduct disorder is more common in boys, and depression and anxiety is more common in adolescent girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephane De Brito from the University of Birmingham, who also contributed to the study, said: “At this point in time, while we can say that the brain is involved in all four of the disorders that we studied, it seems unlikely that these changes in brain structure can explain why there are important sex differences in the prevalence of these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means we might have to look at other factors such as the child's early environment or experiences, which might interact with changes in the structure or function of the brain to increase risk for developing disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together 68 international research groups across five continents from the global alliance group of scientists at the ENIGMA Consortium, which specialises in understanding brain structure and genetic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ftgoqS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/39/Figure-2.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Brains with either of the four conditions tended to have a reduce surface area in regions responsible for processing emotions, responding to threats and maintaining awareness of bodily states" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-569079"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Brains with either of the four conditions tended to have a reduce surface area in regions responsible for processing emotions, responding to threats and maintaining awareness of bodily states&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (University of Bath)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalised anxiety disorder is defined as feelings of stress or worry that affect your daily life and are difficult to control. The NHS says symptoms include difficulty sleeping, feeling restless, irritable or finding it difficult to concentrate and getting tired easily, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is defined as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sadness, hopelessness and losing interest in things you used to enjoy. The NHS says symptoms include continuous sadness, feeling hopeless and low self-esteem. These symptoms may persist for weeks or months and become bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is defined as a person’s ability to pay attention to things, having high energy levels (being hyperactive) and their ability to control their impulses. Symptoms of ADHD, according to the NHS, usually start before the age of 12 and include being easily distracted, finding it hard to listen or follow instructions and forgetting everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct disorder is defined as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which societal norms, rules or laws are violated. Symptoms can include aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness and theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOX3I3OHY3WkdmYVNwOGtYTkJUWHRVWkpQdUlUOHdFZEZVdTRObWN6eThrQzAwT0FUbHNqY0Fhb0VpRDJVQzRCWENpak52ekVqSFBoZEZUWU5YUUdrRHdYWDdQZnEzY3J3MS1RWFA1V1FHLVJFbUF3MmxyUVo1Vjg5NmpuWTJ1ZV9rWnVtY3VMUjlPRTNXV2ZIYw</guid></item><item><title>疫苗生产商有理由对重新配制疫苗的建议发出警告- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/18/biotech-news-johnson-protein-degrader-acquisition-nih/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to stay on top of the science and politics driving biotech today? &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/signup/readout/"&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; to get our biotech newsletter in your inbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The number of affected individuals increased from 378 million in 1990 to 788 million in 2023. As populations have expanded and grown older, the condition has reached a point where it is now listed among the top 10 causes of death across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from NYU Langone Health, the University of Glasgow, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington led the investigation. Their work focused on chronic kidney disease, a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose the ability to clear waste and extra fluid from the bloodstream. Early stages often produce no noticeable symptoms, while advanced disease may require dialysis, kidney replacement therapy, or a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Burden and Mortality Trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study estimates that roughly 14% of adults worldwide live with chronic kidney disease. In addition, approximately 1.5 million people died from the condition in 2023. When changes in population age structures are taken into account, this represents more than a 6% increase in deaths since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that chronic kidney disease is common, deadly, and getting worse as a major public health issue," said study co-senior author Josef Coresh, MD, PhD, director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. "These findings support efforts to recognize the condition alongside cancer, heart disease, and mental health concerns as a major priority for policymakers around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Health Priority for Global Agencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the World Health Organization added chronic kidney disease to its list of health priorities aimed at reducing early deaths from noncontagious diseases by one-third before 2030. Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that identifying current patterns in the disease is essential for developing effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new report was published online Nov. 7 in The Lancet and, according to the authors, represents the most detailed assessment of chronic kidney disease in nearly ten years. It is also being presented at the American Society of Nephrology's annual Kidney Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, considered the most wide-ranging effort to track health-related loss in countries over long periods of time. Findings from this initiative frequently inform public health policy and guide future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate the new estimates, the team examined 2,230 scientific papers and national health datasets from 133 countries. Their work centered not only on diagnoses and deaths, but also on the level of disability associated with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to Heart Disease and Leading Risk Factors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key conclusion was that impaired kidney function is a major contributor to heart disease. The study reports that it accounted for about 12% of global cardiovascular deaths. In 2023, chronic kidney disease ranked as the 12th leading cause of disability-related reductions in quality of life. High blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high body mass index (a measure of obesity) were identified as the most significant risk factors for developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most individuals in the study were in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. Coresh emphasizes that this is a crucial window for intervention, as timely treatment and lifestyle changes can prevent the need for dialysis or transplantation later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Treatment Remains Uneven Worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh also points out that in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and other lower-income regions, many people do not receive dialysis or transplants. These therapies are less accessible and often too expensive for widespread use in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated," said study co-lead author Morgan Grams, MD, PhD. "Our report underscores the need for more urine testing to catch it early and the need to ensure that patients can afford and access therapy once they are diagnosed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapies but Slow Global Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grams, the Susan and Morris Mark Professor of Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that several new medications introduced over the past five years can slow disease progression and reduce the likelihood of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Even so, she explains that it will take time before the benefits of these treatments are reflected worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also warns that because chronic kidney disease is often not tested for, its true global prevalence may be even higher than the study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Support and Research Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was funded by National Institutes of Health grant R01DK100446, the Gates Foundation, and the National Kidney Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh serves as a scientific adviser and equity holder in Healthy.io, a health technology company that provides remote clinical testing and related services. He also works as a consultant for SomaLogic. These roles are disclosed and managed according to NYU Langone Health policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Coresh and Grams, Patrick Mark, PhD, at the University of Glasgow, and Lauryn Stafford, MS, at IHME at the University of Washington in Seattle, were co-lead authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional co-senior authors included Jennifer Lees, PhD, at the University of Glasgow, and Theo Vos, PhD, and Liane Ong, PhD, at IHME at the University of Washington in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Aging sneaks up on everyone, but nothing prepares you for the moment you realize your parents are getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not something that happens slowly in your mind. It hits you all at once, like an emotional punch you didn’t see coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, they’re lecturing you about “real music” or fixing the kitchen sink like it’s no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next, you’re helping them figure out how to refill a prescription or turn on closed captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are eight moments that make you stop in your tracks and realize your parents aren’t invincible anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) They start repeating the same stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard the one about their first apartment more times than you can count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rent was cheap, the neighbors were weird, and they had to walk uphill both ways to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that they don’t remember telling you before. It’s that those memories have become more alive than the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past feels comfortable to them, like a well-worn sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to interrupt my dad when he started his story about his first guitar gig. Now, I just listen. Because one day, I’ll wish I could hear it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start realizing that their memories matter more than their plans, and that’s a hard truth to sit with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Their physical pace slows down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it’s barely noticeable. Maybe your mom walks a little slower at the park, or your dad takes his time getting out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, you realize they’re always a few steps behind. They rest more often, sit longer, and move with a kind of caution you never saw before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this with my mom last year when she visited California. She used to insist on walking everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, she suggested we drive to the café two blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a quiet, heartbreaking shift. The same people who once carried you up the stairs now take them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Technology starts to leave them behind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when they laughed at you for being glued to your phone? Now they struggle to find the camera app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve explained what “the cloud” is more times than you can count. And every time, it feels like starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about time. They grew up in a world that didn’t constantly update itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere between Facebook and streaming services, they reached their limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s tough to watch isn’t the confusion itself, but the &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-9-habits-people-fall-into-as-they-age-that-quietly-destroy-their-confidence/"&gt;loss of confidence&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it. The people who once taught you everything now turn to you for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Their health becomes a constant conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, dinner talk sounds like a medical briefing. They mention cholesterol, blood pressure, or that “funny pain” that won’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start recognizing the names of their medications and the days of their doctor appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time my dad called just to tell me about a new supplement he was taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not about music, not about his day, just &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-vitamin-d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. That’s when it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You realize you’ve entered a new stage of life, where “How are you doing?” really means “How’s your health holding up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) They start saying “I’m tired” more often&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just at the end of a long day. Sometimes, it’s in the middle of a sentence, or after a story, or while looking out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m just tired.” Those three words mean more than they let on. It’s not only &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-eeling-exhausted-psychology-says-these-7-common-habits-are-secretly-draining-your-energy/"&gt;physical exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s life fatigue, the kind that comes from decades of being responsible for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boomers are the generation that pushed through everything. Work, bills, parenting, social change. They didn’t rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when they finally say they’re tired, it’s like a quiet confession that they can’t keep pushing forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a moment that softens you. You start seeing their strength as something that came at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) They lose touch with what’s current&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mention a new artist, and they ask, “Who?” You show them a viral video, and they blink like you’re &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-9-refined-hobbies-that-secretly-reveal-a-high-value-personality/"&gt;speaking another language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re not trying to be out of touch. They just stopped keeping up. The noise of trends, names, and updates no longer matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom once told me she didn’t recognize anyone performing at the Grammys. Not one name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the same woman who raised me on Fleetwood Mac and Joni Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That realization stings. The people who gave you your love of culture now live outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about music or memes. It’s about time pulling you in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) They start talking about the past like it’s all that matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their stories start with “Back in my day” or “When you were little” more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not nostalgia in the lighthearted sense. It’s comfort. The past feels safer than a world they no longer recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but nostalgia isn’t just reminiscing. It’s a kind of psychological anchor. It helps people &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-people-who-live-peacefully-despite-chaos-around-them-usually-display-these-9-traits/"&gt;feel grounded&lt;/a&gt; when everything around them moves too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts a little when you realize they’re living more in memory than in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re trying to make new memories with them, and they’re holding onto the old ones like lifelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) They start needing you in ways they never did before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is the hardest to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mom asks you to help her with her online banking. Your dad wants you to drive him to the doctor, “just in case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start filling out forms for them, &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-10-practical-skills-boomers-have-that-younger-people-pay-hundreds-of-dollars-to-outsource/"&gt;fixing appliances&lt;/a&gt;, and organizing paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become the one who remembers things, who plans, who takes charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift happens quietly, and suddenly you’re the adult in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt it the day my dad asked me to organize his medications. This was the same man who once built my first bike from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him confused over pill bottles broke something inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You realize the roles have reversed. The people who once held your world together now lean on you to keep theirs steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The quiet ache of realizing they’re human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these moments are loud or dramatic. They’re small changes you notice in passing. But together, they paint a picture that’s impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your boomer parents aren’t superheroes anymore. They’re human. Vulnerable. Slowing down in a world that refuses to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that realization hurts, because it reflects your own timeline too. You see where you came from, and you catch a glimpse of where you’re heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that’s the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to slow down with them. To listen to those old stories again. To take the drive to the café, even if it’s only two blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because one day, you’ll wish for just one more story, one more walk, one more reminder that they were here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr.
Lois Anne Cook (née Simmons), age 76, passed away on November 3,
2025, in Eureka, California. Born on October 22, 1949, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lois lived a life defined by service,
compassion, and an unwavering dedication to healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
pursued her medical education at the David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA and completed her residency in pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. Her commitment to public health led her to serve as a
Fellow in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control from 1985 to 1987, where she focused on the
epidemiology of birth defects and developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her
career was marked by a deep devotion to children and families. From
June 1988 to June 1999, she served as a developmental pediatrician
and multidisciplinary team leader for the United States Department of
Defense’s Exceptional Family Member Program. In this role, she worked
tirelessly to ensure that military families with special needs
children received the support and care they deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In
June 2001, Lois founded Comprehensive Pediatric Care, P.C., where she
served as owner and pediatrician until May 2013. Her practice was not
just a place of medicine but a sanctuary of hope for countless
families. She later continued her work as a developmental
pediatrician at Open Door Clinic from June 2013 to July 2014 and then
as a pediatric hospitalist at Mad River Community Hospital beginning
in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
also gave generously of her time as a mentor with the Meritius
Foundation, helping guide and inspire future generations of
caregivers and leaders. Her professional life was a testament to her
belief that every child deserved not only medical care but also
affirmation, encouragement, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Outside
of her professional accomplishments, Lois lived with profound
spiritual depth. Her spirituality transcended any single tradition —
it was an ever-present force in how she moved through life, treated
others, and found meaning in both the ordinary and extraordinary.
Whether hiking with her beloved dogs Lulu and Muzzy or listening to
meditation books through her earbuds, she found peace and purpose in
nature and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every
day, rain or shine, she walked Lulu and Muzzy at the dog park near
her home in McKinleyville. During blackberry season, she would return
from those walks with bags full of berries she had picked along the
way — simple joys that reflected her deep connection to the world
around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
was an avid reader with an extensive library that reflected both her
intellectual curiosity and spiritual journey. She inspired countless
people to believe in themselves and pursue their dreams. Through her
example, she showed that anything is possible when guided by love,
faith, and determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
leaves behind her daughter Jennifer Paris; her sister Jeanne; and
brothers Leon, John, Mark, and Joe. She was preceded in death by her
daughter Marian Jessica Cook and brother Danny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois’s
legacy lives on in the lives of those she touched — patients who
felt truly seen and heard under her care; colleagues who were
uplifted by her wisdom; family members who were nourished by her
love; and friends who were transformed by her presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
was truly an instrument of God — relentless in her pursuit of
healing, committed wholly to service, and gifted with one of the most
compassionate hearts imaginable. She gave selflessly — never
hesitating to offer help or comfort — and never stopped searching
for answers when it came to those under her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
May
her memory bring comfort to all who knew her and continue to inspire
those who follow in her footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The obituary above was submitted on behalf of Dr. Lois Cook’s loved ones.

&lt;p&gt;South Carolina residents are dying younger—and not by chance. In a country already struggling with declining longevity, the Palmetto State has fallen further behind. In 2022, its average life expectancy stood at &lt;strong&gt;73.5 years&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;four full years&lt;/strong&gt; below the U.S. average of &lt;strong&gt;77.5&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Center for Health Statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That gap reflects a complex interplay of preventable risk factors: air pollution, chronic disease, limited healthcare access, and mental illness. Unlike in many high-performing states, public infrastructure in South Carolina fails to consistently support healthy behaviors or provide timely, continuous care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report from Earth.com&lt;/a&gt; highlights South Carolina’s lagging performance across multiple health indices, including access to parks, smoking prevalence, and food environment quality. Together, these indicators point to a population exposed to cumulative risk—and a state system that struggles to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, life expectancy in the United States rebounded slightly in 2022 following a COVID-induced drop, but improvements are uneven. South Carolina’s figures remain well below the national mean, a red flag for both state and federal health planners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Air Pollution and Its Long Tail on Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more insidious but well-documented drivers of early mortality is &lt;strong&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/strong&gt;, especially &lt;strong&gt;PM2.5&lt;/strong&gt;—particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. As detailed by the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, these pollutants can enter the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/air-quality-alert-issued-across-the-u-s-heres-the-full-list-of-affected-states-and-counties/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="97425" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lungs and bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;, exacerbating &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/caffeine-intake-dangerous-heart-risks/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7529" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While South Carolina doesn’t consistently exceed EPA thresholds for PM2.5, &lt;strong&gt;regional exposure hotspots&lt;/strong&gt; remain, particularly in urban centers and along industrial corridors. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthy States Index&lt;/a&gt; notes that South Carolina has a low density of public green spaces and a disproportionately high number of unhealthy food outlets—both of which discourage physical activity and limit access to healthier lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These factors aren’t incidental. The EPA warns that even low to moderate exposure to PM2.5 can increase the risk of &lt;strong&gt;premature death&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly among older adults and individuals with preexisting heart or lung disease. South Carolina’s uneven air quality and built environment reflect national trends in health disparity—rural, low-income, and nonwhite communities tend to bear the heaviest burden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mental Illness Cuts Deeper Than Suicide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pivotal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analyzed over 200 studies and found that individuals with mental disorders face more than double the risk of early death compared to the general population. On average, mental illness shortens life by &lt;strong&gt;10 years&lt;/strong&gt;—often not through suicide, but through &lt;strong&gt;natural causes&lt;/strong&gt; like cardiovascular disease, infection, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review found that &lt;strong&gt;67.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of deaths in people with mental disorders were due to physical illness, not external causes. Despite this, many states—including South Carolina—lack adequate psychiatric infrastructure. Rural areas in particular remain designated as &lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas&lt;/strong&gt;, according to data from the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the issue, mental illness is tightly linked to &lt;strong&gt;higher rates of tobacco use&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;poor diet&lt;/strong&gt;—each of which magnifies risk for premature death. The state’s &lt;strong&gt;elevated smoking prevalence&lt;/strong&gt;, cited in the &lt;em&gt;Earth.com&lt;/em&gt; report, remains above national averages despite public health campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Broken Links in Care and Follow-up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another structural issue driving South Carolina’s longevity gap is &lt;strong&gt;continuity of care&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;Earth.com&lt;/em&gt; analysis, the state shows elevated &lt;strong&gt;hospital readmission rates&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting significant deficiencies in post-discharge support and care coordination. For patients with chronic illnesses, follow-up visits, access to medications, and transportation to clinics are often lacking—especially in rural or low-income zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Readmission rates serve as a proxy for overall system performance. High figures often point to underinvestment in &lt;strong&gt;preventive care&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;primary medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;social support services&lt;/strong&gt;. In a region with high rates of &lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hypertension&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;, these gaps can compound quickly into excess mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; further reinforce the link between chronic disease and early death. In 2022, heart disease and cancer remained the two leading causes of mortality nationwide. Both are heavily influenced by behavior, environment, and system-level access to early detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Geography of Health Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s four-year life expectancy gap is not an anomaly—it is an early warning. The disparity reflects a widening health divide between high-income, infrastructure-rich regions and those where systems are under-resourced or absent altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications are economic as well as epidemiological. Poorer health outcomes increase state healthcare costs, reduce workforce productivity, and impose a heavier burden on safety-net services. Public health is infrastructure, and its erosion has measurable downstream effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State averages can also obscure deep &lt;strong&gt;intra-state variation&lt;/strong&gt;. Some counties in South Carolina outperform the national average, while others lag by nearly a decade. These pockets of high risk, shaped by poverty, pollution, and limited access to services, reinforce the urgent need for targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It also slightly increases dopamine and adrenaline, which contribute to that elevated feeling many experience after drinking coffee.” Caffeine is so effective for boosting energy that oral caffeine is actually an FDA-approved treatment for restoring mental alertness or wakefulness in people experiencing fatigue or drowsiness, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Library of Medicine" data-node-id="3.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NLM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-19jy3s emevuu60"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Davis, R.D., L.D.N." data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Amy Davis, R.D., L.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian based in New Orleans; Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., R.D., C.D.C.E.S., C.D.N., a preventive cardiology dietitian at &lt;a href="http://entirelynourished.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://entirelynourished.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="EntirelyNourished.com" data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;EntirelyNourished.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Another reason caffeine is so effective for increasing energy is that it has nearly 100% bioavailability, per the NLM, which means your body absorbs every milligram in your cup of coffee. Plus, it is quickly broken down and distributed to the brain, reaching peak concentration between 30 minutes and two hours after consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Now, knowing all that, when is the best time to drink coffee? Experts explain when to drink it for the biggest energy boost, plus a few more ways to feel more awake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="8" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="When is the best time to drink coffee for energy?" data-anchor-id="when-is-the-best-time-to-drink-coffee-for-energy" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;When is the best time to drink coffee for energy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you guessed that it would be right when you wake up and feel your sleepiest, you’ll need to guess again. That’s because &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65190894/does-cortisol-cocktail-work/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65190894/does-cortisol-cocktail-work/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cortisol" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s natural “wake-up” hormone, rises to its peak shortly after you wake up, explains Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., R.D., C.D.C.E.S., C.D.N., a preventive cardiology dietitian at &lt;a href="http://entirelynourished.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://entirelynourished.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="EntirelyNourished.com" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;EntirelyNourished.com&lt;/a&gt;. “Drinking coffee during this peak is less effective because the body is already signaling wakefulness, so caffeine’s ability to block adenosine and boost stimulating neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine is reduced,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;For this reason, it’s best to wait until mid-morning, or about 60 to 90 minutes after you wake up, to start drinking coffee. “Cortisol is highest first thing after waking, then falls throughout the day,” says Davis. “Therefore, you may get a better boost from coffee once cortisol levels start to dip.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;That said, if you are someone who swears by that first thing in the morning cup of coffee, it may be giving you an energy boost—but it may not be from the caffeine.

			&lt;p&gt;A new, small study suggests children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, and anorexia share similarly disrupted gut microbiomes, which, by some measures, have more in common with each other than with their healthy, neurotypical peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from &lt;span&gt;Comenius University in Slovakia, the study used stool samples to assess the gut microbiomes of 117 children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exploratory study included 30 boys with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ASD)&lt;/span&gt;, 21 girls with anorexia nervosa, and 14 children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD). The remaining samples were from age- and sex-matched healthy and neurotypical children, providing a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;The People in Your Life Are Sharing Their Gut Microbes With You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of two dominant groups of microbes in the human gut, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroidota"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillota"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was higher across all three disorder groups than was typically seen in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This increase in &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;, especially in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ASD&lt;/a&gt;, and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, particularly in ADHD and AN, corresponds with findings in inflammatory diseases, where altered ratios have been linked to glucose metabolism, inflammation, and satiety regulation," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ADHD and autism groups, the richness of microbiome species was lower than usual. The researchers measured higher levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, microbes that typically hang out in our body without causing damage, yet cause serious infections when elevated in numbers or migrate out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desulfovibrio"&gt;Desulfovibrio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bacteria were more abundant in children with ADHD and girls with anorexia nervosa. These bacteria are known for living in low-nutrient, waterlogged environments, where they reduce sulfate as a source of energy. They also commonly reside in the human gut, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11071772"&gt;at low levels,&lt;/a&gt; potentially causing disease when they grow out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, children with ADHD and girls with anorexia nervosa both harbored fewer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faecalibacterium"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than their peers. This bacterium is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2013.06.003"&gt;usually quite abundant&lt;/a&gt; in healthy human microbiomes, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuad039"&gt;lower levels have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with inflammatory conditions like irritable bowel disease, colorectal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Notably, certain resemblances were observed in the microbiotic taxa abundances across all patient cohorts, underscoring the conceivable influence of gut microbiota composition on the behavioral manifestations of mental disorders," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/halloween-candy-can-overload-your-gut-microbiome-expert-warns"&gt;diet has a direct impact&lt;/a&gt; on the diversity and species that make up our gut microbiomes: less variety on the menu typically means &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;less variety&lt;/a&gt; in our gut flora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picky, slow, and restrictive or excessive eating are common &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361321995631"&gt;among children with autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251314223"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; due to sensory issues, and deliberate food restriction is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/disordered-eating-vs-eating-disorders-whats-the-difference"&gt;defining feature of anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;. Similarities in the gut microbiomes of these children may arise from their limited diets. Changes to the gut microbiome can also exacerbate mental health problems, and these, in turn, may impact the gut, further contributing to a positive-feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note their plans for this research were disrupted by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, significantly limiting data collection and resulting in the small sample size here. They also note that some children were not keen on cooperating with their parents in collecting stool samples, further limiting the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given these limitations, our findings should be interpreted with caution," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;they write&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear, for instance, whether these gut profiles contribute to the children's conditions, are a result of them, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hope future studies can replicate their methods with a much larger sample size to gather more reliable profiles of gut microbiomes in children with these disorders, which &lt;span&gt;could one day &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-identifies-gut-microbe-imbalances-that-predict-autism-and-adhd"&gt;help with diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"We want residents to be aware, watch for symptoms, and make sure they're protected with the MMR vaccine. Community awareness and quick action to limit exposures are key to preventing additional cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge anyone who thinks they were exposed to a measles carrier to watch for symptoms linked to the virus for 21 days after a possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash that starts on the head or face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Utah Health Department says anyone who suspects they've been infected with measles should stay home and call their health care provider before seeking care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials remind the public that the best way to prevent the illness is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two doses of MMR prevent more than 97% of infections.

But it was not enough to rid her of the more aggressive and harder to treat form of the disease, so her oncologist recommended 14 rounds of Kadcyla, a chemotherapy drug used to target HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HER2 is a protein that makes breast cancer cells grow faster and breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of the protein are called HER2-positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The treatment is not cheap. “My chemotherapy is $130,000 a pop because it's very specialized,” Proffitt explained. The treatment increased Proffitt’s chances of survival by 87 percent over the next five years, and by 57 percent over the next 10 years, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three rounds of the treatment were approved in late September, but the full course of 14 rounds was initially denied, according to Proffitt and records reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They don't care that I'm an employee,” said Proffitt, who works as a data program manager in the team that supports Aetna’s Medicaid customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They don't care that I'm a cancer patient.

We collaborated closely with her healthcare provider, and after additional medical information was submitted, the claims were approved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We recognize how complex healthcare decisions can be,” the spokesperson continued. “And we remain firmly committed to ensuring that every member - including our own employees - receives a fair, transparent, and clinically appropriate review of their care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I was not prepared to fight with insurance’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like Proffitt, mom-of-four Amy Logan, of Muncie, Indiana, found herself exasperated after back-and-forths with her insurance provider, UnitedHealthcare, over critical treatments ordered by her oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Is your plan for me to die?” she said she asked a&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-steps-down-stock-131750616.html" data-ylk="slk:UnitedHealthcare;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; UnitedHealthcare&lt;/a&gt; rep on the phone at one particularly low point. “Is that the solution?

I’m just so ready to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Asked about Logan’s experience, a UnitedHealthcare spokesperson said the company “empathized” with anyone going through cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We empathize with anyone facing a cancer diagnosis and are committed to communicating coverage decisions clearly and promptly,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Independent. &lt;/em&gt;“Ms. Logan’s radiation treatment was approved under our policy, which is based on medical society guidelines including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Society for Radiation Oncology and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Her provider was offered a peer-to-peer review with one of our radiation oncologists to discuss her treatment plan in more detail,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both women ended up receiving the full course of treatment prescribed by their specialist medical teams, but said they had to jump through hoops to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, Logan and Proffitt both claimed they were saddled with additional bills in error, running into the thousands, which exacerbated their stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Proffitt said she is still in dispute with Aetna over a $4,000 bill for a white blood cell injection she required after chemotherapy, which she claimed was initially approved before her insurer pulled it from her coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In response, Aetna said it was “reviewing any outstanding claims to ensure they are processed appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Logan, meanwhile, had to contest a $53,000 bill she received — in a filing error.

Because of radiation risks to the fetus, the patient could not have a CT scan but required a PET scan and an MRI, which are more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We really needed to get this done. I kind of thought, no matter what I would order that it would get approved, because this is such a rare case,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They got denied,” Patel said, adding that she then spent hours on the phone trying to jump through numerous hoops with the insurer, who she did not identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than 8 in 10 doctors said that the prior authorization burden is growing worse, reporting that it increased greatly (60 percent) or somewhat (25 percent) in the past three years, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.astro.org/ASTRO/media/ASTRO/News%20and%20Publications/PDFs/PriorAuthSurvey_2024ExecutiveSummary.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 ASTRO study.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; 2024 ASTRO study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rewari attributes rising costs as one of the drivers behind the trend and said that, as a result, companies are relying on a process called utilization management — mechanisms insurance companies implement to control costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They're really investing heavily in that, which is, in other words, a way of reducing the expenses,” he said. “It’s just a delay tactic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;‘Current system is complex and incredibly inefficient’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr Alexandra Zaleta, vice president of research and insights at the nonprofit CancerCare, oversaw a&lt;a href="https://media.cancercare.org/documents/407/original/CancerCare_RedTape_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:major study published this year a;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; major study published this year a&lt;/a&gt;bout how cancer patients “get lost in the health insurance maze” while trying to cope with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The report found that 87 percent of patients on employer plans typically experienced prior authorizations more than those on Medicare Advantage (72 percent) and traditional Medicare plans (57 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Zaleta said the current American health insurance system was incredibly complex and “inefficient” when it comes to cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the one in 10 patients who received a denial, 88 percent appealed the decision.

Of these, 55 percent appealed once, 29 percent appealed twice, and 13 percent appealed three or more times. Nearly three out of four appeals eventually resulted in a decision reversal (72 percent), and 73 percent said the insurer fast-tracked the appeal due to the life-threatening nature of their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Still, many respondents faced long waits for treatment because of the prior authorization process,” the report found. “Among those who appealed, one in three (33 percent) reported the entire approval process, including appeals, took one month or more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Advocacy groups are calling for urgent reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There's been an awareness of this problem for at least the last decade,” Zaleta said. “But whatever solutions or approaches are being implemented are not moving the needle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individual states have taken action on prior authorization this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/news-initiatives/policy-news-analysis/states-lead-prior-authorization-reform" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Society of Clinical Oncology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology &lt;/a&gt;tracked over 110 bills on the subject in 40 states during the 2025 legislative session, with many including calls to improve insurer response times and require companies to be more transparent about approvals, but federal reform has not yet been enacted into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For cancer patients, change can’t come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I try to stay optimistic but it is really hard,” said Logan . “How many delays can I go through?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9ud1VZMnhsZkFOcVNRakoxTkxtb1M5c2pVbGFzWVlkZzNiTnVNQ0RDcTRqNjd6UGdmclNXM3ZfRmNiQmdQUlBSbTNTLWJhOERkeWVnaHpvSVY5cUpjNm5POVF1R0tYYjFJSS1UaXYtUk0xbUYzNm40dmVGMjRsc0k</guid></item><item><title>8种可能帮助您长寿的地中海饮食食品- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-foods-to-help-you-live-longer-11849104</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Need cooking inspo? “Stir lentils into soups or pasta sauces, use them in grain bowls or make a warm lentil stew for a hearty plant-based meal,” recommends Saweres.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts are the ultimate snack. They’re full of healthy fats, plant protein and fiber,” says Berger. Some research shows that eating about 1.5 ounces of nuts per day as part of a heart-healthy diet can lower your risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating nuts daily is also linked with healthier aging among older folks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because what’s good for your heart tends to also be good for your brain, nuts may additionally protect cognitive function as you age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you can always snack on a handful. But why stop there? “Toss them into salads, yogurt or just grab a handful when life gets nutty,” says Berger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 6. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of the Mediterranean diet, olive oil is probably one of the first foods that comes to mind. Indeed, this healthful oil is linked with a plethora of benefits that may lead to a longer, more vital life. “Extra-virgin olive oil is like liquid gold for your body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nourishwithdrkari.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kari Hamrick, Ph.D., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “It is rich in antioxidants and healthy fats that protect your heart, fight inflammation and nourish every cell,” she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While olive oil’s heart-healthy fats get most of the attention, this oil is also rich in beneficial compounds called polyphenols. “The polyphenols found in olive oil are believed to promote longevity by helping to protect against inflammation and cognitive decline, while also supporting healthy metabolic function,” says &lt;a href="https://elizabethharrisnutrition.com/meet-elizabeth" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elizabeth Harris, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 7. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one fruit that’s practically synonymous with the Mediterranean diet, it’s pomegranates. These ruby-red fruits are full of antioxidants, fiber, vitamins and minerals. No wonder they’ve been shown to help protect against cancer and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They may also be beneficial for long-term blood sugar management, says Leatherwood. “If you’re looking for a new fruit to try, pomegranates stand out for their well-documented mechanism of enhancing insulin sensitivity,” she explains. That makes them one of the more diabetes-friendly fruits out there, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 8. Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salmon is one of the best sources of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;long-chain omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, unique polyunsaturated fats linked to heart and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The omega-3s in salmon may also help extend your lifespan. For instance, one study found that consuming 1,000 milligrams of omega-3s per day may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-slow-aging-11793621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow biological aging&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Considering that just 3 ounces of cooked salmon contains between 1,500 and 1,800 mg of omega-3s, salmon is a slam dunk for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-pantry-staples-for-healthy-aging-11730036" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following a Mediterranean diet can help you age with grace, and it may even help you live longer. This healthy eating pattern is rich in fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes, whole grains, seeds, fatty fish and olive oil. But if you’re looking for the best Mediterranean diet foods that may help you live longer, think broccoli, leafy greens, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, nuts, lentils, pomegranates, salmon and, of course, olive oil. They’ve been shown to protect against a long list of age-related illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cognitive decline. So, stock up today to extend your lifespan for years to come!&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why strength training is best for your knees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows aerobic exercise, such as swimming, cycling or walking, is important for those with osteoarthritis to help &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/natural-ways-to-relieve-arthritis-pain/"&gt;reduce pain&lt;/a&gt; and improve quality of life, a strength training routine is crucial if you want to boost your knee health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to have to do something weight-bearing to help the knees,” she explains. This is because compressive forces – which put downward pressure on the knee – stimulate the growth of cartilage cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key is to try and maximise the amount of compressive force you’re getting through the joints, while minimising gliding forces [forward and backward motion].” Working the knee in this way is key to preventing and easing any pain that occurs in or around the joint, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/matt-roberts-best-exercises-strengthen-knees/"&gt;strengthening the main muscle groups of the knees&lt;/a&gt; – your quads, hamstring, calves and glutes – give you better control of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can strengthen those muscle groups, you’re going to keep your knees healthier. That’s whether you’ve got no damage at all, wear and tear or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/foods-help-arthritis-symptoms/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the best three exercises you can do for your knees, according to Macdonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most useful exercise is squats,” Macdonald says. “They can sound intimidating but, fundamentally, it’s just standing up and sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really simple movement pattern but you get serious bang for your buck with it. You’ve got your weight going through both legs; it’s a really safe thing to do; you’ve got compression of the cartilage; the concentration of the quad muscles in your upper thigh; glute activity; and, more broadly, you’re getting a cardiovascular workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to do squats if you have no knee pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with your feet pointing straight forward, keeping your chest and core engaged. Next, bend your knees, going down into a sitting position, until your thighs are nearly parallel with the ground. Allow the knees to move forward, over the centre of your feet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ya4rf005v28qo6jdw30cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States may be heading into its second severe flu season in a row, driven by a mutated strain called subclade K that’s behind early surges in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagh00022e6ft0anr0jv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last winter’s season was extreme, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The US had &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2839724" target="_blank"&gt;its highest rates&lt;/a&gt; of flu hospitalizations in nearly 15 years. At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;280 children died of influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the highest number since pediatric death numbers were required to be shared in 2004.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagh00032e6fxahxk6yf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, with a new variant in the mix, experts say we’re on track for a repeat. And with flu vaccinations down and holiday travel on the way, they worry that things may look much worse in the weeks ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00042e6fie4bakk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The good news: Early analysis shows that this season’s flu shots offer some protection against being hospitalized with this variant, especially for kids. The bad news is that many Americans appear to be skipping their flu vaccines this year. New data from prescription data company IQVIA shows that vaccinations are down compared to where they usually are at this point in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00052e6faie3wgb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu activity is low but rising quickly in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest FluView report&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00062e6ftpq3qx8l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the flu viruses identified this season have been an A strain called H3N2, and half of those have come from subclade K, a variant that was responsible for a rougher-than-normal flu season this summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00072e6f4we6ksc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That variant wasn’t a major player when scientists decided which strains should be in the annual flu shots, so the vaccines cover a related but slightly different group of viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00082e6fr1hft3se@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not like we’re expecting to get complete loss of protection for the vaccine, but perhaps we might expect a little bit of a drop-off if this is the virus that sort of dominates the season, and early indications are that’s probably going to be the case,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00092e6fopkchlv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows that subclade K has seven gene changes on a key segment of the virus. Those mutations change the shape of this region, making it harder for the body’s defenses to recognize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000a2e6fy0u4w9u3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;predominant thing that our immune system targets with antibodies, and that’s also pretty much what’s in the vaccine,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000b2e6fbfs6nfnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            UKHSA scientists found that the current flu vaccines are still providing decent protection against subclade K viruses. Vaccination cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the flu by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness for adults, even those over 65, was lower, about 30% to 40% against needing to visit the hospital or ER.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ynbrk00033b6qw9uhjq2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the scientists offer a caveat: These results are from early in the season, before the protection from seasonal flu vaccines has had time to wane or wear off. The findings are posted in a &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recent preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, which means it was published ahead of scrutiny from outside experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi4h9ull00002e6f4valxrnv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some protection is better than no protection, and while subclade K is expected to dominate the season, it won’t be the only flu strain circulating. No one gets to pick what they’re exposed to. Lauring said his daughter has just recovered from the flu, but it was a B-type strain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000c2e6f900nm9hy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time this new variant has emerged, flu vaccinations appear to be down in the US. According to IQVIA, about 64% of all flu vaccinations were administered at retail pharmacies, which administered roughly 26.5 million flu shots between&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;August and the end of October. That’s more than 2 million fewer shots than the 28.7 million given over the same time frame in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000d2e6fqm51il2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Vaccine skepticism expressed by leaders of the US Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s been a lot of attention on really non-issues,” like vaccine ingredients and separating shots, that “I think, at the best, left people confused but possibly at the worst have left people worried about getting vaccinated,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000f2e6f0nmeyxyj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/gp-news/media-releases/2025-media-releases/october-2025/australia-posts-record-breaking-flu-numbers-as-vac" target="_blank"&gt;have also fallen&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, where subclade K was the predominant virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;this year. As a result, flu hit a record, with &lt;a href="https://nindss.health.gov.au/pbi-dashboard/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 443,000 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere typically runs from May to July, so infectious disease experts often look to those countries for a preview of what might be on the way to North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000g2e6flj4i5bbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What they saw in Australia is that they had a bad season. And so it’s concerning for you and us, what’s coming,” said Dr. Earl Rubin, director of the infectious disease division at the Montreal Children’s Hospital in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000h2e6fhbfmji3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to say whether subclade K actually makes a person sicker than other flu strains, but if it drives more cases, it will certainly drive hospitalizations too, Rubin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000i2e6fdv3vb6vx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you look at severity, the more cases you have, if the same percentage get hospitalized, obviously you’re going to have more hospitalization if you have more cases. So it sometimes will look like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the severity is also worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ya77p00002e6fhvg21jlp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lab testing data has begun to show an uptick in flu cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000j2e6ftdxcoq3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is the time we start to see the rise,” said Dr. Allison McMullen, a clinical microbiologist at BioMerieux, which makes the BioFire test, a popular diagnostic tool for respiratory pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ysxp500053b6q4ybr387l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company anonymously compiles its test results into a &lt;a href="https://syndromictrends.com/" target="_blank"&gt;syndromic surveillance tool&lt;/a&gt;, which can offer a glimpse of what bugs are making people sick at any given time. At the beginning of the month, less than 1% of tests were positive for type A flu. Now it’s 2.4% – still low numbers but going up briskly, which aligns with the CDC trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000k2e6f1zfy2bzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to start seeing heavy holiday travel before we know it,” McMullen added. “With the rising cases that we’re seeing the UK and Japan, it can definitely be a bellwether for what we’re going to see in North America.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000l2e6fq8zw1ye8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signals &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?charts=CjcQACABSABaC0luZmx1ZW56YSBBcgoyMDI1LTEwLTA2cgoyMDI1LTExLTE3igEGYTc3NzdjwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=a7777c" target="_blank"&gt;are also rising&lt;/a&gt; in wastewater, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University. In October, 18% of samples in the WastewaterSCAN network – an academically led wastewater monitoring program based at Stanford University, in partnership with Emory – were positive for type A flu, Wolfe said. In November, that number had risen to 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000m2e6fzwjx3fo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu is something where, when it’s not in season, we don’t detect it very frequently in wastewater,” Wolfe said. Covid, on the other hand, can be detected pretty much all the time, which makes it challenging to know if it’s going up or down, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000n2e6fnifoulpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists can set a threshold for when they can declare that a specific area is in flu season, Wolfe says. So far, just four of the 147 sites they monitor in 40 states have reached that threshold. Those sites are in the Northeast – in Maine and Vermont – in Iowa and in Hawaii.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000o2e6fv0wsin8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am concerned, I guess, that we could have a big flu season this year based on what we’re seeing in other parts of the world, and particularly Europe and elsewhere,” Michigan’s Lauring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000p2e6fjkwaldxn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not too late. Go and get your flu shot,” Lauring advised. “And be alert that it’s out there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Those polyps may be removed if they’re detected early.

This scale breaks them into these main categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: These foods are in their natural state or barely altered. They include things like bananas, carrots, and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: These include ingredients created through minimal processing—pressing, refining, grinding, or milling. Olive oil and almond flour fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: These foods have been changed from their natural state, and often have sugar, oil, salt, or other substances added.

Most packaged foods are considered ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might ultra-processed foods raise the risk of colon cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers didn’t dive into why ultra-processed foods may raise the risk of polyps (and, eventually, colon cancer). However, there are a few theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s possible that ultra-processed foods change the intestinal microbiome, explains &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/tracey-childs-1114999489" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tracey Childs, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Tracey Childs, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., colon and rectal surgeon, chief of surgery at Providence Saint John’s Health Center, and adjunct associate professor of surgery at Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA. That may lead to unhealthy changes that could allow cancerous cells to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These foods may also encourage inflammation in the gut, which may raise the risk of pre-cancerous changes—that can then lead to early-onset colon cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/providers/tiago-biachi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tiago Biachi, M.D., Ph.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Tiago Biachi, M.D., Ph.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a medical oncologist in the Gastrointestinal Oncology Department at Moffitt Cancer Center, agrees, noting that “gut microbiome disruption and chronic inflammation” are likely behind this. “The findings highlight ultra-processed foods as a modifiable risk factor in the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer among younger women,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Childs points out that the study isn’t perfect—it relies on people recalling what they ate, which isn’t always accurate. It’s also a little general about its definition of ultra-processed foods and doesn’t dive into which types may be more linked to colon cancer risk than others, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, Dr. Childs says that the findings aren’t shocking. “We know that processed foods aren’t good for you, and this just may be another way they’re not good for you,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Biachi points out that 20% of colorectal cancers are based on genetic risk factors—but that 80% appear to be sparked by environmental, lifestyle, microbial, and early-life exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How to help prevent colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Biachi recommends people focus on eating a whole food diet, doing their best to limit ultra-processed foods to three or fewer servings a day. “Exercise, protect your microbiome with fermented and prebiotic foods, and use minimal antibiotics,” he says. Dr. Biachi also suggests doing your best to limit alcohol, get seven-plus hours of sleep a night, and try to practice good oral hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, Dr. Biachi stresses the importance of staying on top of your gut health. “Start screening [for colorectal cancer] at age 45 or earlier with family history or multiple risk factors,” he says. “Never ignore red-flag symptoms—rectal bleeding, persistent pain, anemia, bowel changes, and weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you develop any of these symptoms or just have overall concerns about your gut health, it’s important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUDZHS2xacG5VZF8xZVgweWM2blFhZmk0SGdXRFdBMElIMnhYeXg4Ym1QeFVtZzJ6OFo1eUlfQnNhYm1ZTkREU0lNVDI0aGJFWVd0eloteVhrN3BxdWhmbDNuYzFhb3ZzcmQ1cXczMk9EbC05aTZ6MWpoU0FUVkNJLU9fSGVZSHZaSm1fZGE1UQ</guid></item><item><title>新的流感变体“subclade K”使马萨诸塞州处于警戒状态-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Every winter is a different flu season,” said Barouch. “Some seasons are more severe than others, and in some seasons the vaccines are more effective. It is largely driven by mutations that occur every year in flu.” Those gradual changes, known as antigenic drift, can make vaccines less effective at preventing infection and contribute to a more severe flu season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The culprit is a drifted version of H3N2, a subtype of influenza A that has circulated for decades. This variant, dubbed “subclade K,” carries several new mutations. UK leaders are warning of a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;once-in-a-decade&lt;/a&gt;” winter surge as more young people test positive for the subtype. . The variant has also been detected in Canada and Japan, where public health authorities declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock"&gt;flu epidemic last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The latest Massachusetts Department of Public Health dashboard &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;shows low flu activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Historically, patterns in the UK have often signaled what is ahead for Massachusetts winters, and this year is no exception, Barouch said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The concern is that the H3N2 strain in England carries a cluster of additional mutations that scientists have not seen before, meaning this year’s shot is less able to prevent infections, although health experts still expect it to offer meaningful protection against severe illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The impact of those mutations is still being studied, so we do not know for sure,” Barouch said. “But it is likely that those mutations will result in partial evasion of the current vaccine and a more rapid spread.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Individual patients will not be able to tell which strain they have unless they are tested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What we might see on a population level, since the uptick of the flu season appears to be a bit earlier, is that there is a possibility it could peak at higher levels and be more drawn out. We do not know that for a fact, but it is possible based on overseas data,” Barouch said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html"&gt;FluView report&lt;/a&gt; shows flu activity still low across the US, with influenza A accounting for the vast majority of lab-confirmed cases, “but that’s likely to pick up in the coming weeks,” Barouch said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;H3N2 is already present in the US, though it remains unclear how much of that is the specific mutated strain seen in the UK, which requires genetic sequencing to confirm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barouch cautioned that the new strain is “not a reason for panic, but it is a reason why it would be good for people to get vaccinated sooner rather than later.” It takes about two weeks after a flu shot for the body to build up protection, so doctors say this is an ideal moment to get vaccinated to be protected by Thanksgiving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A daily &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;glass of orange juice&lt;/a&gt; might do more than deliver vitamin C. It may influence gene activity in ways that support heart health, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;In a small but detailed study, 20 healthy adults drank about two cups of 100% orange juice every day for two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, North Carolina State University and the University of California, Davis, tracked changes in more than 1,700 genes within participants' immune cells, finding broad shifts in genetic activity tied to blood pressure, fat metabolism and inflammation — all key factors in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cardiovascular health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/orange-juice-sugar-cuts-proposed-fda-help-citrus-growers-what-means-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORANGE JUICE SUGAR CUTS PROPOSED BY FDA TO HELP CITRUS GROWERS: WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how citrus flavonoids — plant compounds also found in berries, tea and cocoa that act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories — may influence the body at a molecular level. The research was published in the journal Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp; Food Research in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes among participants pointed toward lower inflammation and healthier blood vessel function, though responses differed by body weight. Normal-weight participants showed shifts in inflammation-related genes, while &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;those who were overweight&lt;/a&gt; displayed changes tied to fat metabolism and energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study suggests that drinking orange juice daily may influence genes linked to heart health.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of orange juice by providing unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms behind its health effects," the researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Orange juice isn't an elixir — it's one deeply studied example."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also suggest that body weight "may influence molecular response to bioactive compounds in OJ and provide information for personalized recommendations on the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/fruit-vegetable-coatings-grocery-store-produce-spotlight-know-what-were-eating" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COATINGS ON GROCERY-STORE PRODUCE IN THE SPOTLIGHT: 'KNOW WHAT WE'RE EATING'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cautioned that the study was small and lacked a control beverage, showing associations rather than proof of cause and effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said more research is needed to determine whether these molecular shifts translate into &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;clinical benefits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study found that orange juice affected genes differently based on body weight.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolette Pace, a registered dietitian nutritionist from New York, said &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; supports using plant compounds to promote longevity and reduce future disease risk, but noted that while changes in gene expression and health are interconnected, they are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="c-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Orange juice isn't an elixir — it's one deeply studied example," Pace told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, she said, the new study "opens the door to incredible possibilities for how &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;individualized nutrition&lt;/a&gt; can truly work."

If you’re happy with your weight or tend to lose weight easily, or you’re over 65 (and at your ideal weight), eat three meals a day plus one low-sugar, low-calorie snack. Note: If you opt for two meals, Longo doesn’t recommend skipping breakfast!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="body-tip css-mtq1aa emevuu60"&gt;When following this diet, Longo suggests avoiding &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64637530/is-red-meat-good-for-you/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64637530/is-red-meat-good-for-you/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="red meat" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and eating white meat in moderation (once a week) if you’re an adult under 65. But once you hit 65 (or older), it’s common to start losing muscle mass and weight, so you can start introducing a bit of white meat, red meat, low levels of dairy, and occasionally eggs back into your diet, Longo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-the-longevity-diet" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Benefits Of The Longevity Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;It’s nutrient-dense and great for your gut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Following a largely &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a25804908/plant-based-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a25804908/plant-based-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="plant-based diet" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt; has many benefits, says Maddie Pasquarello, RD, founder of East Coast Health in Brooklyn. For one, you’ll be consuming more fiber, which is beneficial for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69046614/guide-to-gut-health-habits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69046614/guide-to-gut-health-habits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gut health" data-node-id="18.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, promotes healthy digestion, and keeps you fuller and more satiated. “It's also likely that by consuming a plant-based diet, you consume less saturated fat and more nutrient-dense whole foods rich in vitamins and minerals,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Eating fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting or avoiding processed foods, trans fats, and sugar (like the longevity diet suggests) are components of a heart-healthy diet, per a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/VHRM.S379874" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/VHRM.S379874" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vascular Health and Risk Management" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.1.0.0"&gt;Vascular Health and Risk Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.2"&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In another &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/44/28/2560/7192512" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/44/28/2560/7192512" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2023 study" data-node-id="21.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.4.0"&gt;2023 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 245,000 people across 80 countries, a diet high in fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes, and fish was associated with lower cardiovascular disease and mortality in all world regions. The longevity diet also recommends choosing foods with high omega-3, which is associated with lower blood pressure, per a 2022 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.025071" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.025071" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of the American Heart Association" data-node-id="21.6" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.6.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.6.0.0"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.7"&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;It could help increase life expectancy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The longevity diet might help reduce your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44788172/biological-age-test/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44788172/biological-age-test/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="biological age" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to the health of your cells and tissues, Longo says. “Part of the longevity diet is the FMD, and now there are forty clinical trials showing that it fights a lot of diseases but also reduces biological age. We’re showing about &lt;a href="https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="two and a half years of biological age reduction" data-node-id="23.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.3.0"&gt;two and a half years of biological age reduction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in two different clinical trials,” he says.

However, there’s also some evidence that red meat and high-protein diets can increase your diabetes risk, per Longo—which is reflected in a 2022 review published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36067917/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36067917/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice" data-node-id="29.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.3.0.0"&gt;Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.4"&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;So, restricting red meat &lt;em data-node-id="29.6"&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;support people who are managing diabetes, especially if combined with the other principles of the longevity diet, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The FMD protocol may help too. Periodic fasting was shown to improve insulin resistance for folks with type 2 diabetes, per a 2022 randomized controlled trial of 40 participants in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35661214/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35661214/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism" data-node-id="30.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="30.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="30.1.0.0"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="30.2"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;A 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38546821/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38546821/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diabetologia" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="32.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="32.1.0.0"&gt;Diabetologia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also co-authored by Longo) looked at 100 adults ages 18 to 75 with type 2 diabetes who were using metformin as the only glucose-lowering drug and/or diet for glycemic control. A five-day FMD protocol was then used in addition to their usual care over a period of 12 months. The study found that integrating a monthly FMD program reduced the need for metformin and improved their HbA1c despite the reduction in medication use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0"&gt;It may help you lose weight (especially if you include the FMD). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There are many types of fasts, each with their own pros and cons—but in general, periodic fasting can help “turn the switch of insulin resistance off,” Longo says. FYI: Insulin is essential for regulating blood sugar, and you could develop insulin resistance if your muscles, fat, and liver don’t respond to insulin as it should, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.1.0"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When your body struggles to use glucose for energy, it can build up in your blood—and high blood sugar can then lead to prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and more, per the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you deal with insulin resistance and/or struggle to lose weight, the FMD aspect of the longevity diet could help. Longo explains it like this: A bear eats a lot before hibernation because they know food won’t be available. Their body goes into “storage mode,” then they end up burning that food and energy during hibernation (similar to a fast). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The same process goes for people, Longo says. If you consume a lot of food but there’s no “fasting period” to activate fat burn, your body holds onto it—leading to potential weight gain and insulin resistance. The FMD acts as a “switch” so that instead of accumulating fat, you start burning it instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you can do the five-day FMD, say, once every four months, it’s still very beneficial if you’re also trying to make ongoing dietary changes, Longo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="drawbacks-of-the-longevity-diet" data-node-id="39" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="39.0"&gt;Drawbacks Of The Longevity Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="40" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;It may be too restrictive for some people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While you can adapt the longevity diet to your lifestyle (more on that soon), let’s face it: It’s difficult to cut out foods you’re already enjoying. It’s also limiting for people who already struggle with food and nutrition. “It can create a feeling of restriction or an altered relationship with food that isn’t healthy,” Pasquarello says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If the timing of your meals is already working for you—or if you have a disordered relationship with food or are recovering from an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69429256/disordered-eating-or-eating-disorder/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69429256/disordered-eating-or-eating-disorder/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="eating disorder" data-node-id="42.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt;—she doesn’t recommend restricting food or fasting. “You’d be better off focusing on other things like eating a balanced diet overall and getting enough exercise,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="43" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="43.0"&gt;You might not get enough protein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="44" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Protein is an essential macronutrient for metabolism, building muscle, energy, and more. That said, following a low-protein diet can put you at risk of not getting enough in your diet, so exercise caution when cutting out meat and consult a doctor and/or nutritionist who can advise you on your individual needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“I don’t recommend further lowering your protein intake unless there is a medical reason for you to do so,” Pasquarello says. “If you remove meat from your diet, that’s fine, but you’ll still need to find other sources of protein to include” such as pescatarian, vegetarian, or plant-based protein options like beans or tofu, Pasquarello says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="47" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This is also important for supporting your fitness: “As we age, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a69287419/guide-to-building-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a69287419/guide-to-building-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="building muscle" data-node-id="47.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;building muscle&lt;/a&gt; through regular &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a69031039/guide-to-resistance-training/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a69031039/guide-to-resistance-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="resistance training" data-node-id="47.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; is important, and if you're resistance training regularly, you'll likely need to increase your protein intake to match,” Pasquarello says.

Restricting, fasting, and limiting yourself to two meals a day won’t necessarily benefit everyone, she says. However, in general, the basic tenets of this diet—eating more fruits and veggies, limiting red meat, consuming more lean and plant-based proteins, minimizing saturated fats, and keeping caloric intake to what meets your needs—aren’t all that bad, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="53" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Chat with your doctor before starting the diet, and if they've given you the OK, here’s what to do next:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="54" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.0"&gt;Modify the diet so it’s attainable for your lifestyle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="55" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“You can and should adapt the recommendations to fit what you can actually achieve long-term,” Pasquarello says. “If that means adding one to two veggies or fruits a week beyond what you’re already consuming, great. If it means swapping meat at one dinner a week for a plant-based source of protein or a piece of fish, great.” Aiming for perfection won’t set you up for success and usually makes people revert to old patterns, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="57" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Adults over 65 should especially consider modifying the diet to include more protein to avoid risk of malnourishment, frailty, and diseases that come from reduced bone mass, muscle mass, or low blood cell counts, per a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00398-1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00398-1" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cell" data-node-id="57.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="57.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="57.1.0.0"&gt;Cell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="57.2"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="58" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Longo recommends introducing the diet slowly but surely, and of course, being mindful of any allergies, sensitivities, or intolerances to certain foods. If you have any questions about the best modification plan for you, reach out to your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="59" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="59.0"&gt;Keep up with your workouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="60" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The longevity diet website &lt;a href="https://valterlongo.com/exercise-and-longevity/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://valterlongo.com/exercise-and-longevity/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommends" data-node-id="60.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="60.1.0"&gt;recommends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; walking, weight training, and daily body-strengthening exercises alongside the proposed dietary changes. Pasquarello suggests resistance training combined with eating enough protein to help you build muscle. In general, you should aim for 150 minutes of exercise per week, Longo adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="61" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s safe to say that following a mostly plant-based, high-legume, whole grain diet while limiting saturated fat and processed foods has many benefits.

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia has confirmed three deaths from the Marburg virus in its southern region, marking the country’s first known outbreak of this highly lethal hemorrhagic fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus has attracted global concern due to its high fatality rate, lack of an approved vaccine or treatment, and potential for regional spread. [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marburg virus is a member of the Filoviridae family, sharing similarities with Ebola. [6] The virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia (now Serbia) among laboratory workers exposed to African green monkeys imported from Uganda for laboratory use. [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural reservoirs and sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is widely recognized as the natural reservoir for Marburg virus. [15] The virus has been repeatedly detected in this bat species — including direct detection of Marburg virus genome and high seroprevalence of antibodies in bats living in mines and caves associated with outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Guinea, Ghana, Zambia and Sierra Leone. [22]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans contract the virus when exposed to bat guano, urine, saliva or by direct handling/bites; contamination of fruit or other foods by bats also plays a role. [20]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African green monkeys, while implicated in the first outbreak in 1967, are not considered a reservoir but can be infected like humans and act as amplifiers during outbreaks. [15]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several major outbreaks, such as the 1998-2000 outbreak in DR Congo and recurring cases in Uganda, began among miners or people who frequented caves/mines populated by bats. [20, 23]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Marburg spreads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads among humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids (blood, saliva, vomit, urine, stool, sweat) of infected individuals. [6] Surfaces and materials contaminated with these fluids — such as bedding or clothing — can also pose a transmission risk. [6] Human-to-human transmission requires close physical contact or exposure to contaminated items, making household caregivers and health care workers especially vulnerable. [5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it compares with COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike COVID-19, Marburg does not spread through airborne respiratory droplets. Transmission requires direct contact, so its spread is generally slower and outbreaks are less likely to become global pandemics. [6] Marburg outbreaks tend to be geographically contained but can pose cross-border risks if initial cases are not isolated promptly. [2] There have been no documented cases of Marburg outside Africa spreading to the general population in the United States or other developed regions. [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Marburg is deadly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus causes sudden onset of high fever, severe malaise, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea and — in many cases — severe hemorrhage and organ failure. [5] Patients often die from shock due to blood loss and multiorgan dysfunction. [6] Case fatality rates have ranged from 24% to 88%, with some outbreaks even higher, depending on supportive care and rapid response. [5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1967 (Germany and Yugoslavia/Serbia): The first documented outbreak occurred among laboratory workers exposed to African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Seven deaths and 31 cases were recorded, providing the initial identification of Marburg virus as a deadly human pathogen. [6]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1998-2000 (DR Congo): A gold mine area was the epicenter, leading to 154 cases and 128 deaths (83%). Miners regularly exposed to fruit bats in Goroumbwa Mine sparked the outbreak, which ceased when the mine was flooded, depriving bats of habitat. [20]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2004-2005 (Angola): The largest and deadliest outbreak to date, with 252 cases and 227 deaths (90%) reported in Uige Province. Many cases were young children. [15]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2007, 2012, 2014, 2017 (Uganda): Multiple smaller outbreaks, all fatal in some cases. 2012 saw 18 cases and nine deaths; other years involved isolated cases with high mortality. [16]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2014-2021 (Various): Ghana (2022) and Guinea (2021) reported fatal isolated cases, demonstrating virus emergence in West Africa. Guinea and Ghana bats living near outbreak villages tested positive for Marburg virus, with genetic matches to strains found in human cases. [5, 22]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2023 (Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania): Both countries experienced their first outbreaks. Equatorial Guinea saw 40 cases and 35 deaths (88%); Tanzania had nine cases and six deaths (67%). [14]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2024 (Rwanda): Rwanda had 66 cases and 15 deaths (23%), among the largest outbreaks in recent years. [18]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Imported cases: Cases have occurred in the Netherlands (2008) and the United States (2008), but no secondary spread, showing containment outside Africa. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it begin, and what is the risk of outbreak?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks typically start with human contact with fruit bats in rural or mining areas, then spread via human-to-human contact in close settings. [14] Outbreaks are increasing in frequency, likely due to changes in land use, wildlife habitats and improved detection, but global risk remains focused in regions with direct bat exposure and limited health infrastructure. [14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global threat level low&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marburg is not considered a significant threat outside Africa due to its transmission dynamics and containment measures. [5] Regional risk exists near affected areas, but widespread transmission akin to COVID-19 is not seen with Marburg. [3] The current Ethiopia outbreak is under strict containment by local health authorities and WHO. [1, 28]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marburg is rare, causing limited numbers of deaths globally each year, usually in sporadic or small outbreaks. [6] There is no indication of large-scale, ongoing annual deaths globally; outbreak deaths vary by year and location. [6] People in the United States and other regions are currently at extremely low risk. [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containment strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Africa are employing a comprehensive set of measures to contain Marburg outbreaks, drawing from hard-won lessons during previous emergencies like Ebola and prior Marburg incidents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rapid surveillance and contact tracing: Authorities in Ethiopia and other affected nations swiftly identify, isolate and monitor contacts for 21 days to break transmission chains. [1]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Enhanced laboratory and genomic capacity: Africa CDC, World Health Organization and partners have strengthened lab infrastructure for rapid testing, genomic sequencing and molecular diagnosis, enabling quicker confirmation of cases and outbreak sources. [27] The ability to rapidly sequence and track virus variants has allowed quicker, more targeted interventions and insight into outbreak origins. [1, 28]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Infection prevention and control: Teams enforce strict protocols in health care facilities, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, dedicated isolation wards, and decontamination of surfaces and materials. Strict use of PPE by health care workers when treating patients, alongside rigorous hand hygiene and sanitation protocols, has minimized nosocomial transmission. [5, 29]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Safe and dignified burials: Special burial teams carry out procedures that prevent exposure to infectious fluids, a major risk factor identified in past outbreaks. Traditional burial practices involving close contact with deceased bodies were identified as major transmission routes in past outbreaks, including Angola (2005). [30, 35]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Community engagement: Authorities prioritize clear, transparent communication to win public cooperation, combat stigma and improve the reporting and management of cases. Educating communities on transmission risks, symptoms and prevention strategies helped foster cooperation with health measures like isolation and safe burials, overcoming fear and stigma. [27, 32]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cross-border coordination: African health officials now work closely with neighboring countries to share data and keep border regions on alert, reducing regional risk. [27]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sexual transmission management: Condom use reduces risk of possible sexual transmission. [9, 35]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Integrated One Health approaches: Coordinating human, animal and environmental health surveillance has helped identify zoonotic sources early and reduce spillover risks. The latest outbreaks show countries integrating Marburg control efforts with those for other diseases (e.g., Mpox), maximizing resources and improving early warning systems. [1, 9]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons from past outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Early detection is critical: Delays in recognizing outbreaks can lead to explosive spread. Rapid response, as seen in Ethiopia now and Rwanda in 2024, dramatically improves outcomes. Early detection of symptomatic patients and their immediate isolation reduces opportunities for the virus to spread. [28, 35]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Community resistance can undermine response: Distrust, fear of isolation and traditional practices delayed containment in Angola (2005) and elsewhere. Health authorities now emphasize culturally sensitive education and work closely with community leaders. [30]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Health care worker protection: Past outbreaks saw high nosocomial (hospital-based) spread. Routine health care worker training, PPE and clear protocols have reduced staff infection rates and improved hospital preparedness. Training health care staff on IPC measures was a major lesson from past outbreaks. [5, 29]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Safe burial as core response: High-risk traditional burial practices are now addressed directly by involving families in safe burial planning, reducing secondary spread. [5, 29]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Laboratory testing and genomic surveillance: Improved diagnostics enable fast confirmation of cases and understanding of outbreak dynamics, allowing more targeted interventions. This reduces unnecessary quarantine and focuses resources efficiently. [5]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ongoing risk communication and support: Ongoing risk communication and survivor support programs — focusing on stigma reduction and reintegration — are now standard, supporting both containment and long-term recovery. [26, 34]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing infection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Avoid direct contact with sick individuals or those suspected of Marburg infection. [5]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Practice strict hand hygiene and use PPE in health care settings and when caregiving. [5]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Avoid handling fruit bats and carefully disinfect surfaces and clothing exposed to sick individuals. [5]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Community education and contact tracing are vital during outbreaks. [4]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, as I began to report on bird flu, an outbreak was raging across farms in Ohio and Indiana. Over 18 million hens — 5% of America’s egg-laying chickens — were ultimately culled in a cascade of cases that, to me, appeared connected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My reporting confirmed my hunch that they were linked: After the first farm was infected, the virus spread from that site to others, moving from farm to farm in a way that revealed a major flaw in America’s strategy to combat bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, ProPublica published a story that demonstrates how the federal government is &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/bird-flu-airborne-usda-pandemic"&gt;failing to control the spread of a deadly virus&lt;/a&gt; that could spark a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture typically attributes bird flu outbreaks to failures of biosecurity — meaning farmers have not done enough to protect flocks from contamination by wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But my genomic analysis shows wild birds had little to do with this particular cluster of infections. Although the USDA said it tested nearly 1,000 virus samples in wild animals from December to April in Ohio and Indiana, no nearby wild birds were found infected with this outbreak’s strain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I did find a strong predictor of infection during the first few weeks of this outbreak: whether a farm was downwind from that first contaminated facility. That pattern reinforced the suspicions of egg producers and some local officials that the virus may be spreading on the wind. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If bird flu is airborne, the government’s current biosecurity-based strategy cannot protect farms on its own. A poultry vaccine likely would have stemmed the damage from this outbreak, experts told me. Yet while other countries have curbed infections through vaccination, the U.S. has not authorized those efforts amid political and economic pushback.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The USDA told me it didn’t investigate whether the wind contributed to the outbreak’s spread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I used genetic markers, satellite imagery, property records, trade notices, wind simulations and Google Street View to do the work USDA did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinpointing the Outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The USDA does not release identifying information about farms infected with bird flu — only the counties in which outbreaks occur. Between December and March, cases in Ohio and Indiana spanned six adjacent counties across more than 2,500 square miles in one of the nation’s densest poultry-producing regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I worked out a way to pinpoint which farms had been infected by taking a close look at the &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/inspection/import-export/import-export-library/european-union"&gt;notices the USDA publishes detailing regions restricted from exporting poultry products&lt;/a&gt; due to bird flu outbreaks. These notices describe a 10-kilometer radius around an outbreak to avoid revealing the actual site. They do give the northernmost point of the circle, and I found that plotting 5 kilometers south of that point revealed the site of the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knowing the actual locations led me to realize that the majority of cases clustered around the intersection of three counties, within a few miles of one another. It appeared much more likely that the virus was spreading among farms than repeatedly spilling over from wild birds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracing the Virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To find out if that was the case, I turned to genomic data from virus samples collected on farms and sequenced at the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The labs publish many of these sequences on &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/"&gt;GenBank&lt;/a&gt;, the National Institutes of Health repository for genomic data. Computational biologists and virologists visualize that data using a &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/avian-flu/h5n1-d1.1/genome"&gt;tool called Nextstrain&lt;/a&gt;, which builds phylogenetic trees showing how virus strains are related.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One way flu viruses like this one mutate is by swapping genetic code between strains in a process called reassortment. Each virus contains eight distinct segments that can mix and match when multiple strains infect the same cell, resulting in a new strain of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers developed versions of the Nextstrain tool to visualize &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/avian-flu/h5n1-cattle-outbreak"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/avian-flu/h5n1-d1.1"&gt;specific&lt;/a&gt; genotypes of bird flu, the most common ones seen last year: B3.13, which was spreading in dairy cattle, and D1.1, prevalent in wild bird populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I altered the code of that software to target a less common strain of the virus, labeled D1.3 by the microbiologists at USDA’s labs. There were two main lineages of D1.3 in the United States. One spread across hundreds of miles, killing off wild birds and poultry from Wyoming to Puerto Rico. The other lineage was made up of samples of the virus found only in domestic poultry and one human — exclusively in Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I traced that family tree of viruses back to the root: a pair of samples that I was able to link to a farm called Howe’s Hens, the first involved in this outbreak, in late December, just weeks before cases exploded in the region. (“Howe’s Hens” is how the farm is referred to in &lt;a href="https://www.poultryimprovement.org/documents/shellegglayerflocksapprovedforexport.pdf#page=80"&gt;documents from the National Poultry Improvement Plan&lt;/a&gt;, which certifies egg exporters, but the farm is also referred to as “Spring Meadows” by Cooper Farms.)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The samples from Howe’s Hens had fewer mutations than the viruses that were sampled later on, and those later samples shared the unique mutations that first appeared at Howe’s Hens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the two samples bore a mutation that continued to show up in the other cases, while the other did not. The simplest explanation, virologists told me, is that as the virus spread through the farm, the mutation arose and persisted in other chickens infected on the farm. Because that mutation likely occurred on the farm, the farms that were subsequently infected were likely exposed to the virus that originated at Howe’s Hens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virologists said that it was important to compare the virus in poultry to that found in wild birds, in case the virus was actually spreading in wild birds. But there were no viruses sampled from wild birds that bore any resemblance to this lineage. That’s not to say that the infection didn’t originally jump from wild birds into Howe’s Hens. Rather, the government examines thousands of samples of the virus from animals — wild and domestic, dead and alive — to help researchers better understand how the virus is spreading and changing. But in all of those tests, they never happened across a source or close relative of the virus that caused this outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was particularly surprising because Ohio and federal officials were pointing to wild birds as the main culprits spreading the disease, particularly &lt;a href="https://dailystandard.com/archive/2025-02-17/stories/51799/blame-geese-for-bird-flu"&gt;a flock of wild geese found dead in a nearby wetland&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the outbreak started. However, documents I requested show that the geese were afflicted with an entirely different strain of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question of how to control bird flu revolved around understanding how the flocks were infected in the first place. USDA, saying that wild birds were behind the vast majority of cases since it emerged in 2022, argued for stronger biosecurity practices to prevent contact between hens and infected birds, and to keep workers contaminated with the virus from infecting their flocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Farmers and industry leaders pointed to evidence suggesting a different source for the infections, saying that sick birds first appeared near air inlets and the virus infiltrated farms with seemingly impenetrable protocols to guard against outside contamination —  arguing that potential airborne spread of the virus needed to be taken more seriously. I decided to look into it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blowing in the Wind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts cautioned me to consider egg producers’ motivations as I examined their claims of airborne spread: The industry was under intense pressure to solve the bird flu crisis by raising farms’ levels of biosecurity to ensure that no wild birds or errant workers were bringing the virus into barns. Those higher levels of biosecurity are expensive and time-consuming, but wouldn’t be very effective if the virus was spreading primarily through the air. Concluding that airborne transmission drove cases would relieve that pressure on individual operators and put more of a burden on the government for a fix. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The progression of cases certainly seemed like they could be spreading over the air. To evaluate the possibility, I tried to plot weather data collected from nearby airports, looking for patterns between cases and wind direction and speed. But airport wind records pointed in different ways at different speeds, and it wasn’t clear what the pattern was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I turned to previous work on the airborne transmission of bird flu. Yang Zhao, an engineer and animal scientist at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, had &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47788-z"&gt;researched&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10533824/"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, simulating where wind would have blown dust by using a model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That model, &lt;a href="https://www.ready.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php"&gt;dubbed HYSPLIT&lt;/a&gt; (short for Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) takes historical weather data as an input and simulates where particles would have traveled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mirroring those techniques, I generated a “plume” that showed where dust originating from the first infected farm would have blown over a certain time period. I looked at the period when I was confident that there were infected birds on that farm: Dec. 22, when dying chickens were first noticed, to Dec. 31, when the entire farm had been depopulated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This analysis doesn’t account for how much infectious material would have actually been spreading in the environment. That would require additional information, like how many chickens were sick and at what rate. The USDA returned a public records request that likely would have contained some of those facts, but every piece of information was redacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the plume represents the relative exposure: how much more exposure to dust a farm downwind would have had compared with another farm. It’s also possible that it shows how wind would have influenced more than just the very small dust particles I simulated, like chicken feathers or insects.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Because we do not have reliable information on the order in which infections occurred, I could only investigate the possible spread from the first infected farm. Once the virus wound up on many farms, it became much harder to infer the path the virus took between them. In addition, the USDA redacted metadata from the samples taken on many of those farms that would have allowed some matching between farms and samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I examined the plume that originated at Howe’s Hens, there was a pretty clear overlap with the first wave of cases and where the wind was blowing over this period. But what if all of the farms in the area that were infected just happened to be in the direction that the wind was blowing? I wanted to get a better sense of whether this could be a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To untangle factors that might be leading me astray, I built a list of all poultry farms in the surrounding area. I limited the analysis to a 12.4-mile radius around Howe’s Hens (or 20 kilometers, the official &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai-surveillance-commercial-premises.pdf"&gt;surveillance zone&lt;/a&gt; around an infected farm where officials sample other farms to see where else an infection had spread).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no comprehensive database of poultry farms in the region, so I analyzed a &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints"&gt;database of building footprints&lt;/a&gt; created by Microsoft to identify groups of buildings that resembled the long, skinny barns typical in poultry production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the vantage of a satellite, hog farms can look similar to egg farms. So I used county property records that detailed the structures on parcels where I saw barns to sort out whether an image was of a turkey or chicken farm, versus one containing other livestock. This involved a lot of manual checking to make sure I didn’t exclude any potential farms in the area, which required evaluating satellite and aerial imagery. In many cases, I also looked up addresses on Google Street View — most farms were right up against the road and often had some sort of sign showing what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, I identified more than 200 poultry facilities in the surveillance zone, of which 55 were infected over the course of this outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I then overlaid the plume on those farms to get the relative level of exposure from the dust originating at Howe’s Hens, to evaluate the relationship between that exposure and farm infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I found that farms with high dust exposure were about 20 times more likely to test positive for bird flu within three weeks. About 16% of the farms exposed to the plume were positive by Jan. 20, versus only one farm testing positive by then (0.8%) outside the plume.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, as I drove around the region in May, it was hard to miss signs indicating egg and turkey operations were affiliated with Cooper Farms, a regional livestock company. Turkey producers in the area overwhelmingly contracted with the company, which produces meat largely destined for the deli aisle (versus whole turkey common on Thanksgiving tables), along with pork and eggs. According to the company, it also operates a massive feed operation, producing over a million tons annually, which supplies its many contract farmers. (Cooper Farms declined to speak to me and instructed all of its contracted farmers to do the same.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Howe’s Hens was affiliated with Cooper Farms. I expected there would be some common links between it and other affiliated facilities. After all, the USDA told me that it had attributed the spread of the virus in Ohio and Indiana to “numerous movements of people and equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhao, one of the airborne transmission researchers, said the data would be even more compelling if I could rule out Cooper Farms being the common link here. Using Street View and records from the National Poultry Improvement Project, I identified the farms exposed to the plume that were associated with the company. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those results showed that the share of Cooper Farms infected in the first wave was roughly the same as the rest of the area’s farms.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Zhao said that the results at least implied that something other than traffic between the farms was fueling the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s a good indication that factors such as airborne transmission may play a role, though more replication would be needed to reach firm conclusions,” Zhao said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Evidence Suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts were pretty aligned in saying none of what I had found definitively proves that the wind caused the virus to spread; there’s a difference between correlation and causation, and the virus never follows just one mode of transmission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard, it’s really hard — having spent my career studying viruses that spread through the air — to prove that the virus is in the air,” said Seema Lakdawala, who studies the epidemiology of influenza viruses at Emory University. “Yes, the wind might be important, but it may be other things that are moving in the wind, maybe the bugs, some other sort of vector moving along the wind that we have not accounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, other experts I discussed our analysis with — eight in total — agreed that this data presented a plausible case for the wind playing a role in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It just seems so likely to me that this was an airborne thing,” said Brian McCluskey, former chief epidemiologist with USDA’s agency that oversees the response to bird flu. “I mean, how else would it have moved around so quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhao said that ProPublica “definitely moved one step further from our research in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This result is very exciting, very interesting to me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The USDA insisted that this particular outbreak was “unique” and “not representative” of the entire wave of bird flu that started in 2022, and that the “overwhelming majority” of infections stem from wild birds. The agency said its biosecurity strategy “remains rooted in real-time data, internationally recognized best practices and a commitment to transparency and continuous improvement,” and that it is “proactively assessing” the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts told me that understanding what drove this massive outbreak was important, and it didn’t seem like USDA was doing that work. The agency did not evaluate airborne transmission in this outbreak. It also doesn’t make it easy for others to do so, withholding key information that would allow journalists and researchers to evaluate the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As infections surge again this fall, the USDA continues to urge farmers to improve biosecurity while it dismisses a significant way the virus could be spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ProPublica</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 09:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQSjRBem85U3FBS2REb2FRTXBLZjRMSTdYamJiNEpGWGJ3Y1Iwa0kyQTVPRlAxTGNRdHRja24xWi1lZ2RRaTczNGpWQXFUY0FnSU83T004WEhSUC1jZkR4Y1pucW1PLTF3UzRUcXJiNi1zLTdYMU15clVNbXpKd0VQdlRxOA</guid></item><item><title>您睡觉时开着灯吗？哈佛大学的研究警告说，隐藏的健康威胁可能会损害你的心脏-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/do-you-sleep-with-lights-on-harvard-study-warns-of-hidden-health-threats-that-could-damage-your-heart-and-brain/articleshow/125406719.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to artificial light in the evening might be more harmful to your health than previously even understood, according to the new &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251103093005.htm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard University &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;research.

The researchers discovered that higher exposure to nighttime light was associated with increased brain stress activity, inflammation in blood vessels, and a greater likelihood of developing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Simple Bedtime Practices From Sadhguru For Better Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How environmental factors and nighttime light affect heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that environmental factors, such as air and noise pollution, can contribute to heart disease by affecting nerves and blood vessels through stress,” said Dr. Shady Abohashem, head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School. He emphasised that while light pollution is widespread, its effect on cardiovascular health has not been well studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, Dr. Abohashem and his team analysed data from 466 healthy adults with a median age of 55. All participants underwent PET/CT scans, and researchers measured the amount of artificial light in their homes at night. The study followed these individuals for a decade, between 2005 and 2018, tracking major heart-related events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the link between nighttime light and heart stress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the ten-year follow-up, 17% of participants experienced significant heart problems. Those exposed to higher levels of artificial light at night consistently showed elevated brain stress activity and increased inflammation in their arteries. The study found that each rise in light exposure corresponded with a 35% increased risk of heart disease over five years and a 22% increase over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abohashem noted, “We observed an almost linear relationship: the more exposure to nighttime light, the higher the heart disease risk. Even modest increases in light at night were associated with stress responses in the brain and arteries.” The study explains that when the brain detects stress, it triggers an immune response that causes inflammation in blood vessels. Over time, this process contributes to atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, significantly increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. These risks remained even after accounting for traditional factors such as noise pollution, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the risk was highest among participants living in low-income or high-traffic areas, where artificial light exposure tends to be greater. This suggests that environmental conditions play a critical role in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical steps to reduce nighttime light exposure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep bedrooms as dark as possible to reduce artificial light exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid using screens such as phones, tablets, or TVs before bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use blackout curtains to block external light from entering your room.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a sleep mask to shield your eyes from residual light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advocate for community measures like shielding streetlights to limit light pollution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimise unnecessary outdoor lighting around homes and neighbourhoods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage the use of motion-sensitive lights to reduce constant nighttime illumination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abohashem remarked, “Light pollution is more than just an inconvenience; it can actively increase the risk of heart disease. Clinicians and policymakers should consider this factor in prevention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Additional risks beyond the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of nighttime light exposure extend beyond cardiovascular health. Previous studies have linked bright outdoor lights at night with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Artificial light can disrupt the body’s circadian rhythm, leading to poor sleep quality, insomnia, and sleep deprivation, all of which contribute to cognitive decline. For older adults, the correlation between light exposure and Alzheimer’s risk was stronger than other factors such as alcohol use, depression, obesity, or chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article summarises research published by Harvard University and reported by ScienceDaily.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. health authorities, under the direction of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are considering how they might discourage or even ban vaccines that rely on a common ingredient to boost their effectiveness, or break up ones that protect against multiple diseases in a single shot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If policymakers follow through on these ideas, vaccine makers could have to develop new alternatives to several key vaccines, a process that can take a decade or more and cost upwards of $1 billion, employees of vaccine makers said. The changes would impact a substantial share of the shots on the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should the administration seek rapid changes to vaccine ingredients, certain shots could become less available and protection against dangerous diseases that haven’t been a widespread threat in decades — including measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and polio — could wither.&lt;/p&gt;

She explains, “Ageing naturally brings a decline in muscular strength, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/bone-density" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="bone density"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt;, and neuromuscular function. This can lead to an increased risk of falls, fractures, and a general loss of independence. However, engaging in plyometric training can help mitigate these effects and even reverse some age-related declines. Some studies have shown that if you’re unable or unwilling to jump, you’re at a higher risk of falling."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of plyometric training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;✔️ Improves muscle power and strength&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;✔️ Enhances bone density&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;✔️ Boosts balance and coordination&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;✔️ Promotes &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/ready-for-an-adventurous-trail-8-best-mountain-bikes-of-2025-to-improve-cardiovascular-health-101759988267987.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiovascular health"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;✔️ Increases muscle mass, which reduces the risk of sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jelena's message challenges the widespread fear around high-impact training for older adults. Instead of avoiding jumps, she says the smarter approach is learning how to land safely, build power gradually, and move explosively within one’s capacity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A scalable start for everyone over 40&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make plyometrics accessible, Jelena recommends beginning with low-impact variations:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step jumps instead of full jumps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soft-landing squats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lateral shuffles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow-to-fast transitions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mini hops before full jumps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once form and confidence improve, movements can gradually increase in height, speed, and intensity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

While many people rely on medication to manage symptoms, not everyone tolerates the side effects, and some prefer to explore more natural approaches. Nutrient deficiencies caused by dietary habits, lifestyle patterns and underlying health factors may contribute to a higher risk of migraine attacks. Understanding how these nutrients work in the body can offer valuable insight into more personalised migraine management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are increasingly convinced that low levels of key vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, riboflavin, magnesium, and coenzyme Q10, may significantly impact the development, severity, and duration of migraines. A growing body of research suggests that supplementing these essential nutrients could help safely reduce the intensity, frequency, and duration of migraine episodes for certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Common cravings and the vitamin deficiencies they indicate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding how vitamin D deficiency increases &lt;keyword id="30752139" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="migraine-risk" source="Orion"&gt;migraine risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in recent years suggests that vitamin D supplementation may benefit individuals with recurrent migraines, particularly those whose vitamin D levels are below the recommended range. Vitamin D interacts with metabolic pathways and hormonal systems that influence how the brain and body process sensory information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When levels are low, the likelihood of experiencing migraine pain may increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is also involved in reducing inflammation and regulating nitric oxide levels. Both processes are linked to migraine development. It influences neurotransmitter release, which affects how the brain responds to pain signals. A deficiency may therefore disrupt these systems and heighten migraine susceptibility. Another reason vitamin D matters is its close relationship with magnesium. The body requires adequate vitamin D to absorb magnesium effectively and magnesium deficiency itself is associated with migraine. Low vitamin D levels may therefore compound the problem by impairing magnesium absorption, increasing the chance of experiencing more frequent or severe attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; recommends a daily intake of 15 micrograms of vitamin D for adults up to age seventy and 20 micrograms for those over seventy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How magnesium strengthens neurological stability and lowers migraine risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium works alongside vitamin D to support numerous bodily functions, including nerve signalling and neuromuscular stability. Research strongly supports an association between magnesium deficiency and migraine, with studies showing that increasing magnesium levels may reduce both the frequency and intensity of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays a protective role by helping prevent excessive neuronal excitation. When nerve cells become overstimulated, migraines can occur more readily.

Some studies link mitochondrial dysfunction to the development of migraine, suggesting that riboflavin supplementation may help improve energy metabolism and reduce migraine frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of clinical research shows encouraging results. Several trials in adults demonstrate that riboflavin can reduce the number of migraine episodes, although evidence for children and adolescents appears more mixed. Another study examining a combination of 400 milligrams of riboflavin, 600 milligrams of magnesium and 150 milligrams of coenzyme Q10 found that this blend may improve symptoms and lessen the overall burden of migraine when taken consistently for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily intake recommendations from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are 1.1 milligrams of riboflavin for females and 1.3 milligrams for males, but therapeutic doses used in studies are often significantly higher. Anyone considering supplementation should consult a healthcare professional for appropriate guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coenzyme Q10s role in mitochondrial function and migraine prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coenzyme Q10 is another nutrient crucial for mitochondrial energy production. Low levels may influence how efficiently cells generate energy, a function believed to play a role in migraine development. Some evidence suggests that supplementing coenzyme Q10 could help prevent migraine headaches, although further large-scale research is needed before it becomes a universally recommended therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People interested in exploring coenzyme Q10 supplementation should discuss it with a clinician to determine suitability and dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes migraines and how nutrient levels influence their severity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraine is one of the most common neurological conditions worldwide and can significantly affect daily life. It is estimated that around twelve per cent of the global population experiences migraines, including many children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ihs-headache.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1477_ichd-iir1final-1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;International Headache Society &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;recognises two main forms of migraine. Migraine without aura involves moderate or severe head pain lasting between 4 and 72 hours, often accompanied by nausea, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity and worsening symptoms during physical activity. Migraine with aura includes temporary neurological disturbances such as visual flashes, sensory changes, speech difficulties or motor disturbances that develop gradually and typically last between five and sixty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triggers can vary greatly. Some individuals react to specific foods, while others respond to environmental factors such as weather changes or strong smells. Episodes may also be linked to dehydration, stress, hormonal fluctuations or irregular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrient deficiencies may be an additional contributing factor, making dietary support and supplementation a valuable consideration for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for managing migraine effectively&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helpful lifestyle strategies and complementary therapies for managing migraine pain:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone experiencing frequent or severe migraines should seek medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Could this have happened just because I was drinking water?” asked Jon Duhaime, a lifelong Merrimack resident who was diagnosed with kidney cancer at 32.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers from the state Department of Health and Human Services and Dartmouth College analyzed nearly three decades of cancer registry data from Merrimack and surrounding communities. They also evaluated whether it would be possible to do a larger study to determine the cause of the elevated rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Merrimack, a town of about 30,000, is nestled between New Hampshire’s two largest cities, Manchester and Nashua. Residents said they had seen it as a peaceful suburban town, ideal for raising a family — until the toxic chemicals came to light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The contamination traces back to a factory in Merrimack, where PFAS, common in industry and consumer products, had been used for decades. Saint-Gobain, a French plastics manufacturer, purchased the factory in 2002 and continued to produce water-resistant materials and other coated textiles using the chemicals. Some were released through the factory’s stacks into the air, polluting groundwater and wells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A state investigation &lt;a href="https://www.pfas.des.nh.gov/pfas-occurrences/saint-gobain-performance-plastics/site-investigation-history" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pfas.des.nh.gov/pfas-occurrences/saint-gobain-performance-plastics/site-investigation-history "&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that more than a thousand nearby properties had PFAS levels in their water that exceeded state limits. The company &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/23/metro/saint-gobain-close-merrimack-plastics-manufacturing-facility-amid-ongoing-pfas-concern/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/23/metro/saint-gobain-close-merrimack-plastics-manufacturing-facility-amid-ongoing-pfas-concern/"&gt;ceased&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing in Merrimack in 2024, which it said was part of a broader restructuring of its operations in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Experts cautioned against interpreting the New Hampshire report as evidence of a causal link between the PFAS contamination and cancer cases. However, there is consistent evidence linking exposure to PFAS to an increased risk of kidney cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, classifies PFOA, a common PFAS chemical detected in the water supply in Merrimack, as carcinogenic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Joseph Braun, an epidemiologist at Brown University with expertise in PFAS, said, “Even down to the lowest doses that we measure in these studies, the risk of cancer seems to increase with every increment of exposure.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/nhscr/pdf/MKC-Study-Report-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/nhscr/pdf/MKC-Study-Report-2025.pdf"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; 59 cases of kidney cancer in Merrimack between 2013 and 2021 — about 38 percent more than would be expected. They also observed slightly more kidney cancers than expected in Manchester.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Duhaime was one of these cases. In 2019, he received a shocking diagnosis after having medical imaging done for a gastrointestinal problem: early-stage kidney cancer. His doctors ordered genetic testing because he was so young, and everything came back clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Duhaime, a nurse practitioner, remembered telling himself, “With cancer, sometimes there’s no rhyme or reason, and you get unlucky.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But when he saw news reports of increased kidney cancer rates in the area, he began to think differently. He asked his doctors, “Do you think I could be one of those cases?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He had a portion of his kidney removed and has made it past the five-year mark without a recurrence. The study results, he said, are affirming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s facts,” he said. “There’s statistics. It’s not just hearsay anymore.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

The team would look into PFAS, as well as known risk factors for kidney cancer such as smoking and high blood pressure and other contaminants in the area, according to Megan Romano, a Dartmouth epidemiologist and study co-author. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But that work is contingent on the scientists obtaining funding, no easy feat. A large-scale study could cost $500,000 or more per year for at least five years. Romano said the federal funding landscape is uncertain, and the state does not currently plan to fund the final phase of research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re seeing a really big shift in the way that many different aspects of biomedical research are prioritized,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Trump administration has pledged to target PFAS contamination but has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/climate/epa-cuts-forever-chemicals-grants.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/climate/epa-cuts-forever-chemicals-grants.html "&gt;slashed&lt;/a&gt; grants to research these chemicals and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/climate/pfas-zeldin-trump-administration.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/climate/pfas-zeldin-trump-administration.html "&gt;rescinded&lt;/a&gt; drinking water standards for four types of PFAS implemented by President Biden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Romano said the team is also looking at less-traditional funding streams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We do have a good track record for funding,” she said. “I think it’s a matter of how long it’s going to take.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The recent study was funded as a result of a bill introduced by a state lawmaker from Merrimack. The lawmaker, Representative Nancy Murphy, raised six children in the town. Several developed thyroid issues, including a son who was diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder Graves’ disease at 14 and lost 55 pounds in two months. The PFAS contamination drove her into politics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Murphy said she will introduce a bill to fund the final phase of the study if she wins re-election in November 2026. (The filing period is over for the current session.) But she is worried her fellow lawmakers are “tapped out.” The last study cost $500,000 and received some pushback on the expense. Amid a tight budget, she said, she worries the number for the final phase will be seen as “impossible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“People say, ‘Well, you’re just worried about Merrimack,’” she said. “They don’t see how many communities across the country are impacted by PFAS contamination of their drinking water, air, and soil.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;PFAS are troublingly prevalent in drinking water, including in New England. A federal study found that these chemicals taint &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/06/tap-water-forever-chemicals-pfas/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/06/tap-water-forever-chemicals-pfas/ "&gt;nearly half&lt;/a&gt; of the nation’s tap water, affecting tens of millions of Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In Westminster, a town in central Massachusetts, state officials &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/07/06/science/when-organic-is-toxic-how-composting-facility-likely-spread-massive-amounts-forever-chemicals-across-one-town-massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/07/06/science/when-organic-is-toxic-how-composting-facility-likely-spread-massive-amounts-forever-chemicals-across-one-town-massachusetts/ "&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; a composting facility probably &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-08/emerging-issues-in-food-waste-management-persistent-chemical-contaminants.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-08/emerging-issues-in-food-waste-management-persistent-chemical-contaminants.pdf"&gt;spread massive amounts of PFAS&lt;/a&gt; across the town, contaminating wells with chemicals that far exceeded state limits. On Nantucket, where PFAS have been found in pockets across the island, the town has &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/24/science/nantucket-pfas-officer/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/24/science/nantucket-pfas-officer/ "&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; a full-time employee focused solely on PFAS — the first of its kind in the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Katherine Reeves, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has studied the impact of PFAS on human health, cautioned that even if the study is funded, the bigger challenge would be to pinpoint a cause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers would probably be unable to obtain PFAS exposure measurements from before the cancers were diagnosed, and PFAS concentrations in blood samples after cancer diagnoses have limited value, she said. She added that the number of cases could also be too small to provide reliable estimates of associations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Definitive answers about what could be causing the increased kidney cancer rates will be very challenging to come by,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Laurene Allen, who cofounded Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water in response to the pollution, said results linking the cancer cases to PFAS could inform health interventions in Merrimack and open the door for policies to protect other communities from going through a similar ordeal. But even without a study, she said, residents know the harms they’ve endured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“For almost 10 years, residents have seen patterns and recognized that this could only be through exposure,” she said. “We know what we see.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Chronically high intake increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. These, in turn, contribute to elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and systemic inflammation—all powerful drivers of coronary artery disease and heart attacks.​&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523137178"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that adults who consume the most sugar-sweetened beverages are over 12% more likely to develop hypertension and heart disease compared to those consuming the least. Mechanistically, added sugars—particularly fructose—have been shown to increase myocardial oxygen demand, increase heart rate, and intensify blood pressure variability, all of which stress the heart and the arterial system.&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, chronic influx of sugar leads to chronic low-grade inflammation—recognized as a central pathway to atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries), ultimately raising the chance of plaque rupture and heart attacks. Prospective cohort studies cited by the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000167"&gt;BMJ &lt;/a&gt;and others highlight a dose-response relationship: those deriving over 20% of their day’s energy from added sugars have a markedly higher risk of heart events, and risk multiplies past the 25% mark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 04:49:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
