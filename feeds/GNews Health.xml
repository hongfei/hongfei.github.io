The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-54527-001?doi=1" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, indicate that emotional reactions may play a central role in driving ideological extremity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to better understand what might fuel increasingly polarized and extreme political attitudes in the United States. While disagreement and debate are foundational to democratic systems, the political landscape has become more divided in recent years, with a growing number of Americans identifying with viewpoints further from the political center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has pointed to several contributors to this trend, including psychological tendencies like intolerance of uncertainty or a preference for black-and-white thinking. But many scholars have also proposed that emotion—especially negative emotion such as fear or anger—plays a powerful role. Emotional reactions can shape how people interpret news, view political opponents, and form alliances. In this study, the researchers asked whether people on the far left and far right not only hold strong beliefs but also experience political information in similarly emotional ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also aimed to test a concept sometimes referred to as the “horseshoe theory,” which suggests that political extremes may resemble each other more than they do moderates. If true, then individuals on opposite ideological ends could be more psychologically alike than different, at least in how they respond to political content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research was inspired by the growing political polarization and ideological extremism observed around us. Recent political crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Israel and Gaza have intensified extreme views across both ends of the political spectrum, which motivated us to look beyond left-right differences,” said study author Daantje de Bruin, a PhD student at Brown University and member of &lt;a href="https://www.feldmanhalllab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the FeldmanHall lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, we asked whether there might be common neurophysiological mechanisms underlying political extremism, regardless of ideological content. This idea aligns with the ‘horseshoe theory’ of politics, which suggests that the far left and far right, despite opposing beliefs, often resemble each other in psychological and behavioral ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the team recruited 44 participants from across the political spectrum, with a particular focus on those at the ideological extremes. Participants were identified based on how far they leaned from the political center on a 100-point scale, ranging from extremely liberal to extremely conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants watched a politically charged segment of the 2016 vice-presidential debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence while undergoing brain scans in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. At the same time, the researchers recorded physiological responses—specifically, galvanic skin conductance, which measures emotional arousal through changes in sweat gland activity. Eye-tracking was also used to assess where participants focused their attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the brain imaging data revealed a consistent pattern: participants with stronger political beliefs, regardless of whether they were liberal or conservative, showed increased activity in brain areas associated with emotion and threat detection. These included the amygdala, known for processing fear; the periaqueductal gray, which is involved in defensive behaviors; and the posterior superior temporal sulcus, a region linked to interpreting social cues and understanding others’ intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings were in line with our hypothesis that holding extreme views (regardless of the content of those views) means that individuals share, at least on some dimensions, similar processing of the world around them,” de Bruin told PsyPost. “This helps explain how the language or actions of die-hard liberals or conservatives can appear eerily similar to the language and actions of those on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that extreme political views may be tied to stronger emotional reactions to political material. In other words, the more ideologically extreme a person was, the more emotionally charged their brain response appeared to be when watching political content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed how similarly participants’ brains responded to the debate. By comparing moment-to-moment brain activity across pairs of participants, they found that those who both held extreme views—even if one was very liberal and the other very conservative—showed more synchronized brain responses than moderates did. This synchronization was especially pronounced in areas of the brain involved in understanding others’ perspectives and emotions, such as the temporoparietal junction and adjacent regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this effect was not merely the result of shared ideology. Participants with very different political beliefs still showed similar patterns of brain activity if both were high in extremity. This provides evidence that the way people process political content may be shaped more by the intensity of their beliefs than by the direction of those beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another layer of the study looked at the role of language. The researchers used a machine learning tool to evaluate the level of extreme language in the debate video. They found that parts of the video containing more extreme or provocative language tended to strengthen the brain synchrony effect among extreme individuals. In other words, the most emotionally intense parts of the political content seemed to draw extreme viewers into an even more aligned neurological state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers examined physiological arousal. While they did not find that more extreme individuals had higher average arousal levels overall, they did find that shared physiological responses between pairs—specifically synchronized spikes in skin conductance—correlated with greater neural synchrony. This relationship held especially true for participants with the most extreme beliefs. In other words, when extreme individuals not only shared strong views but also experienced similar emotional reactions in their bodies, their brains tended to process political content in more closely aligned ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that people with more extreme political views, on either end of the political spectrum, show stronger brain responses to the political content in areas involved in emotions, such as fear, threat detection, and understanding the perspective of others,” de Bruin explained. “We also find that more extreme individuals, regardless of their political ideology, show more similar neural responses to political content.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite stark differences in political beliefs, extreme individuals on opposite sides of the political spectrum thus process political content in similar ways, providing neurophysiological support for the horseshoe theory of politics. This suggests that ideological opposites may be more alike in how they process politics than they realize. Recognizing this shared experience could foster greater empathy and reduce dehumanization across the political divide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides evidence that emotion plays a central role in shaping how people with extreme beliefs experience political content, but it also comes with some limitations. First, the political material used covered only a narrow set of topics, specifically immigration and policing. It is not clear whether similar results would emerge with different political subjects or more recent content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the research was conducted entirely within the United States and may not generalize to other countries or political systems. Cultures with different norms, levels of polarization, or media environments might show different patterns of emotional and neurological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study provides new insight into how emotion and social perception influence political extremity. The fact that people with opposing ideologies can show similar patterns of brain activity suggests that emotional experience may be a shared thread connecting those on both sides of the political divide. Recognizing this shared experience might help reduce hostility and open the door to more understanding, even in a time of rising polarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the theorized link between extremism and affective processing, highlighting the importance of understanding polarization and radicalization as not just a cognitive or ideological process, but also one that considers emotion,” de Bruin said. “In future work, we aim to further investigate how affective processing might be altered in more extreme individuals, and why their responses may differ from moderates. Ultimately, we aim to use these insights to inform approaches that reduce polarization and help people engage with political information more thoughtfully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-54527-001?doi=1" target="_blank"&gt;Politically Extreme Individuals Exhibit Similar Neural Processing Despite Ideological Differences&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daantje de Bruin and Oriel FeldmanHall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 10:03:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPVjhYUmFZZUl0NXMyZ0JQcjc2dmdWOTVTa3NqbTVuaTJNYkN0VExfT012akhLWGtFcUV6MzlfWTFOQUFYbkhlMW9YRC05ak84U3dlSFlHSkJtTGVhZEdNWXMxanNPVmRvYUVlUDA5a3hVTXBBaHhxT3pQNmVhYVhyVXdWSXZZdk13bTZkR2tVNUlSclF1ekdCeFJjVzY4bV9SRGNJZHJJOA</guid></item><item><title>新疗法“修复”与脑部疾病有关的基因……逆转数百万人患有衰弱性疾病的症状-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15177439/autism-epilepsy-gene-therapy-syngap1.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists may be one step closer to a new therapy that could 'fix' the faulty genes at play in people with brain disorders such as autism and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a million people worldwide are thought to have a SYNGAP1-related disorder (SRD). This is a group of brain disorders that disrupt normal brain development and can lead to intellectual disability, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15148925/epilepsy-cure-childrens-brains.html"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, movement problems and impulsive behavior, as well as symptoms associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, the conditions are caused when someone only has one functional copy of the SYNGAP1 gene instead of the usual two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, scientists in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-state/index.html" id="mol-076e8d60-a514-11f0-9292-7b50e0f25ff3"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt; say they have found a way to repair the damaged gene and potentially help patients function better in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, researchers administered juvenile mice suffering from the brain disorder with an altered adenovirus, or a cold virus, that carried a healthy copy of the SYNGAP1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus successfully delivered the gene to brain cells, with the rodents then experiencing broad improvements in their behavior up to two weeks later, including the near elimination of epilepsy, a neurological disorder where patients suffer from recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and a reduction in hyperactive and risky behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mice also saw a substantial shift in their brain wave patterns, or electrical pulses generated by the brain, from abnormal to much closer to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Boaz Levy, a biochemist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science who led the study, said: '[This study] is an important milestone for the field that provides hope for those who suffer from this class of severe neurological diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say they have found a potential new therapy for a brain disorder that can cause autism symptoms in children (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Gene supplementation is providing a functional new copy of a defective gene, a strategy that has great potential for correcting diseases where a gene is completely missing or where a single copy of a gene is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This [study] provides a clear demonstration that SYNGAP1-related disorders can be treated with a neuron-specific gene supplementation strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is in the early stages and was only carried out in mice, with researchers saying clinical trials still need to be done in humans to confirm that the therapy works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists heralded the results as a positive step towards developing a treatment for the condition. It was particularly notable that the study was successful in juvenile mice, which is around the same age at which humans are diagnosed with SRDs and could, therefore, receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,500 Americans have been diagnosed with a SYNGAP1-related brain disorder, activists say, although estimates suggest many cases have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not all autism and epilepsy cases are caused by SYNGAP1-related disorders, although patients with SRDs may be diagnosed with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorders are considered to be a spectrum because the faulty genes often do not affect the brain in exactly the same way or to the same level of severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no specific treatment or cure for the condition, but doctors say they can help patients to manage symptoms using antiseizure medications or implanting devices into the body that can help to control nerve activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to two percent of all intellectual disability cases, including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, are estimated to be caused by SRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the therapy, a healthy copy of the faulty gene is delivered to brain cells by an adenovirus, or cold virus. It was successful at improving symptoms in juvenile mice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 31 children in the US has autism, a surge on the one in 150 estimated to have the condition in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested that about 80 percent of autism cases are linked to inherited genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Robert F Kennedy Jr, the Health and Human Services Secretary, is among those who have argued that the surge in cases cannot be blamed on genetics alone and is likely also down to unidentified environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 470,000 children in the US have epilepsy, with experts also suggesting that the condition is caused by both genetic and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epilepsy is a common symptom in patients with SYNGAP1-related brain disorders, with more than 80 percent of sufferers also diagnosed with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the research, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(25)00759-2.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001625007592%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, scientists injected the altered adenoviruses into the mice's cerebral ventricles, the fluid-filled cavities in the center of the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injection was carried out by inserting a needle past the eye and into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Boaz Levy, left, who led the research, and associate investigator Dr Rong Guo and scientist Dr Meagan Quinlan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is the cross section of the brain of a mouse in the study. The highlighted areas represent locations where the adenovirus delivered the treatment to the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to two weeks later the rodents were put through a battery of tests to measure the impact of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests included tracking the movements of mice in a 7.8inch by 7.8inch arena, to check for erratic behavior, and placing them in an elevated maze and monitoring their behavior to estimate anxiety and risk-taking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'Our findings provide the first evidence that... gene therapy can restore SYNGAP1 function and reverse key [symptoms], supporting its potential as a transformative therapeutic for patients.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

School, work, screens – all of those hours on your backside add up, and our bodies don’t appreciate it one bit. A new study warns that long hours sitting causes significant health issues – even for young, active adults – raising the odds of heart disease and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if that news wasn’t bad enough, researchers also argue that today’s federal exercise recommendations don’t fully counteract the harm caused by excessive sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aging studies that focus on people in their 60s, this project zeroed in on younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Riverside&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1,000 Colorado residents, with an average age of 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-from-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Health risks from prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reports that logging eight or more seated hours a day pushes two early warning signs in the wrong direction – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;cholesterol ratio&lt;/a&gt; and body mass index (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;) – even for people who work out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol ratio, which blends triglyceride and cholesterol levels to flag cardiovascular risk, and BMI, an estimate of body fat, both climbed with prolonged sitting, signaling potential trouble ahead if habits don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though unhealthy diet and smoking play a major role in increasing BMI, the full-point jump we saw in the data was just due to sitting alone,” said Ryan Bruellman, lead researcher and doctoral candidate in UCR’s Department of &lt;a href="https://genetics.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-twin-driven-analysis"&gt;Twin-driven analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large twin-and-sibling project examined how sitting time and exercise intensity relate to these “aging” &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included over a thousand adults, ages 28 to 49, with an average age in the early thirties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group mixed adopted siblings, non-adopted siblings, and both identical and fraternal twins to help separate lifestyle effects from genetics and shared upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants reported about 60 hours of sitting each week – roughly 8.6 hours per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men tended to report more vigorous activity and also showed higher BMI and TC/HDL cholesterol levels than women. Sitting time was roughly normally distributed across the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team modeled how BMI and TC/HDL change with age while accounting for sitting time and physical activity intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made a clear distinction between “moderate” activity and “vigorous” activity because a brisk walk does not stress the body like hard running or fast cycling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also used a “co-twin control” approach: comparing one twin directly to their co-twin to reduce genetic and family-environment noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In plain terms, if an identical twin who moves harder and sits less shows better biomarker values than their genetically matched twin, behavior is a plausible contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-and-health-hard-data"&gt;Sitting and health – hard data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More sitting tracked with a drift in the wrong direction over the thirties and forties: higher BMI and a higher TC/HDL ratio. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercising-more-than-recommended-may-greatly-reduce-health-risk-of-early-death-from-any-cause/"&gt;Vigorous activity&lt;/a&gt; was shown to push those levels back to normal ranges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When models accounted for sitting time, people who did around 30 minutes of vigorous exercise per day showed BMI and TC/HDL values similar to those of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-minute-of-short-energy-burst-exercise-every-day-can-add-years-to-your-life/"&gt;sedentary people&lt;/a&gt; who were five to ten years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin comparisons reinforced this pattern. In identical and fraternal pairs, the twin who sat less and did more vigorous activity tended to show better TC/HDL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A focused test looked at identical twins who were “discordant,” meaning they differed enough in overall health, sitting times, and vigorous exercise for a fair comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairs were sorted into two styles: “Active Replacers,” who swapped some sitting time for vigorous exercise; and “Active Compensators,” who sat a lot but tried to offset it with more vigorous exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math defined an “exchange” as replacing each extra hour of weekly sitting with about six minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-law-of-diminishing-returns"&gt;Law of diminishing returns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed a very clear correlation: less sitting and more vigorous movement was directly linked to a healthier TC/HDL profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits from vigorous activity showed diminishing returns. Moving from almost none to a reasonable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;daily dose&lt;/a&gt; mattered a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, adding more and more did not keep producing the same improvement in TC/HDL. Vigorous work can compensate for sitting to a point, yet reducing sitting still looked “paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health guidance offers simple guardrails: 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Intensity definitely matters for certain outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lipids and metabolic risk, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/six-minutes-of-vigorous-exercise-helps-protect-the-brain-from-aging/"&gt;vigorous minutes&lt;/a&gt; often deliver extra value. Moderate activity still counts; this result highlights where vigorous work seems especially potent for these early biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-of-biomarkers"&gt;Limitations of biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, this one had limitations. BMI and TC/HDL are informative, not definitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were relatively young adults, so we are looking at early warning signs, not clinical disease. This was not a randomized trial; no one assigned people to sit or sprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin design, including the “co-twin control” comparison, adds strength beyond typical observational studies, but it cannot prove causation the way a trial can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported sitting time can be fuzzy. Wearable devices could sharpen future estimates and help test whether replacing specific chunks of sitting with short, vigorous bouts delivers consistent shifts in TC/HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vigorous-exercise-and-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Vigorous exercise and prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, prolonged sitting is much more damaging to human health than scientists had ever imagined, particularly in younger people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This twin-and-sibling study suggests that how much we sit and how hard we move shows up in early risk markers for heart and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-quality-could-be-the-key-to-better-metabolic-health/"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across adults in their late 20s to late 40s, more sitting was linked to higher BMI and a higher total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, regular vigorous activity pushed those numbers in a healthier direction, with roughly 30 minutes a day associated with profiles similar to sedentary people 5-10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study makes it clear: if you sit for long periods, the standard exercise recommendations are not enough,” Bruellman concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All adults, even the younger ones, need to move more, and exercise harder, to counteract the impact of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break up long sitting spells. Stand more during tasks. Add walking between activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a routine that includes some vigorous minutes most days – enough to push breathing and heart rate safely for your fitness level. Reducing sitting and adding vigorous movement worked best together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308660#sec017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 01:28:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPRDBUd21vWU5WUXFuc0hkbFllWGV5V2RkTFdCeVdGTWdiS3BzOUEtTUg2TDl2MDhhTXZabVNybzZHX1NuUmlfbGJmd3g4X2gtMTZhUDhZeDQtUnA1bnFRdFVJMEZPTnBSU2pTQXJ4MWQ3eEExd1pndUJ2VVFkNVlfMnJNeEwwVXpPRGE0R1NPckg2bVZXeWlfTGhuaWlaZkdtMjl2dVpVdzBVbDV6TklCTFdR</guid></item><item><title>专家声音报警：与自杀有关的流行脱发药物- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/experts-sound-alarm-popular-hair-loss-drug-linked-to-suicide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:37:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOc21HTHNoTi10R3ZRUndQbGRkeVpjTzBhQ3BvZ0xOMnJWRkFfQmxKa05fd1VwSTVBWjdodGpLQm5jSmlCZFRQOE9xS0dJNjRMYk14YkNyenVNR0V0Vmh6M1B2WUhnbWp4VUs2cTAzR1BIbDR2ZWlZYUFDTENrcVFYUDl3SUZpdW95NG5XOWd1Zw</guid></item><item><title>你是哪个卧铺？新研究揭示了5种主要的睡眠模式以及它们揭示了您的健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/which-sleeper-are-you-new-study-reveals-5-major-sleep-patterns-and-what-they-reveal-about-your-health/photostory/124468209.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the most vital “non-negotiable” aspects of a healthy life – we all know that. Whether you’re aiming to take care of your heart, preserve your cognitive health, or even in a pursuit to shed some pounds, sleep is one of your most reliable allies. Now, while most advice tells you to “get eight hours,” a new large-scale study suggests that how we sleep may matter just as much as how long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists who studied hundreds of adults using brain scans, sleep journals, and lifestyle data, there are five distinct sleeper profiles — and each comes with its own clues about your mental, physical, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revelation is a shift from the one-size-fits-all approach to sleep. It suggests that even two people who sleep the same number of hours might differ drastically in how restorative that sleep is — based on how often they wake, whether they need sleep aids, and how energized (or drowsy) they feel during the day. In short: not all sleepers are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we break down each of the five sleep patterns, explore what they can reveal about your health, and offer ideas on what to do if your sleep type is less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to break the yawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:32:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州东南部的狂犬病蝙蝠咬人- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2025/10/rabid-bat-bites-person-in-southeast-michigan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L67J2QSAFBD75E5C4HFG5LHPZE"&gt;ST.

Some infected people also may experience fevers, headaches, and body aches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the illness so alarming to health experts is that it is highly contagious with a short incubation period. Officials say that some people can experience symptoms as early as 10 to 12 hours after exposure to the virus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person, eating/handling contaminated food (especially shellfish), and touching contaminated surfaces, officials warn. According to experts, the norovirus can remain on surfaces for hours, and sometimes days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outbreaks may occur in places where people consume water and/or food prepared or handled by others, such as nursing homes, hospitals, restaurants, cruise ships, banquet halls, summer camps, and family dinners,” an NJ DOH statement read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say the best way to prevent norovirus is to wash your hands with soap often and thoroughly. This is especially important when handling food, changing diapers, or caring for an infected person. Officials add that using hand sanitizer is significantly less effective than washing your hands when combating norovirus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See prevention methods, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands well and often. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook shellfish thoroughly and wash fruits and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash laundry in hot water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you contract norovirus, you should do your best to avoid contact with healthy people to help contain it. The CDC specifically asks infected people to steer clear of immunocompromised people, including seniors and children under five years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, experts ask that infected people continue to isolate and practice preventive measures two days after they feel better, as the virus can still be transmitted even after symptoms disappear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These preventative measures are especially important for people who work in restaurants, schools, daycares, long-term care facilities, or “other places where you may expose people to norovirus,” the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment or cure for the norovirus, and officials remind residents that antibiotics will not help norovirus symptoms, as it's not a bacterial infection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts recommend plenty of rest and consuming plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting. Water, juices, and electrolytes are encouraged, but sick people should avoid drinks containing alcohol or caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people should also avoid food that may trigger symptoms, sticking to “bland” foods like toast, rice, and bananas until symptoms improve, experts say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus typically lasts one to three days, according to officials. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials say patients should seek medical attention when experiencing the following: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe dehydration (dry mouth, sunken eyes, decreased urination) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in your vomit or stool &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent vomiting or diarrhea (more than three days) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (over 101°F) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe abdominal pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;To learn more about norovirus, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;CDC’s website here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiBox-root css-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:11:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNdU9BUzFSemtGZWhxeGk3UW4yUWRVb1BjX1U1VVQ5cDV6dDNObFd2LVVfaUlEQndyVERXOHlBN2RWMUQzNXNGT193N0xXUmZZLXY2ZFJJaHJheUJTRWdQU0xjZk8yZDdhc0l0TjBrY0ZuanZNYzRQQjJUUGpfRHhyRHFKM2F2ZVdSZzZtc9IBpgFBVV95cUxOR3pJTjRENEp3enhQVFJQUTRTY2Vkck92MW9OM3BiRVE1T3NELWFvRllQMDhXSmFSbHRpS3BIZUJXYjRWQlByc1ZDTkF1d2gwSmhFT0RXWGtNRWU1bks5N3l2RlNHZ2d6MVNSZWhUbXFGbHpwMlpIREJqRzJMN25HdFloOTJySjhOeTBfUkF5YV9wN2ZRRFJSN0lnWVVyekR4VDQyLWZR</guid></item><item><title>关于全国乳腺癌宣传月的总统致辞-白宫（ .gov ）</title><link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/10/presidential-message-on-national-breast-cancer-awareness-month/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;A PROCLAMATION&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day, breast cancer upends the lives of countless Americans, subjecting them and their loved ones to unimaginable fear, uncertainty, and heartbreak.  This National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the resilience and courage of those battling breast cancer—and we reaffirm our commitment to ending this horrific disease once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One in every 8 women in the United States will face breast cancer during their lifetime.  My Administration is determined to end this tragedy.  As part of our historic Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are working to lower cancer rates so that fewer lives, families, and futures will be devastated by cancer’s enduring physical and emotional torment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration urges all Americans to prioritize their health by knowing their family history and other risk factors, using methods of early detection, and implementing preventative protocols and lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk. We also commit to the continued prioritization of research and medical advancements that accelerate cures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month, we rejoice with our Nation’s four million breast cancer survivors, we pray for those who are fighting for remission and healing, and we mourn with all who have lost a precious loved one.  United in purpose, we commit to working towards a healthy, prosperous, and cancer-free American future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most flu patients do not die from the infection, but rather a complication triggered by the disease. The disease can weaken the immune system, raising the risk of someone suffering from sepsis or pneumonia, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu levels are currently 'minimal' nationwide, according to CDC surveillance, but have risen slightly in four states, including North Carolina. Other states with elevated levels are Connecticut, Illinois and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levels of RSV and norovirus are also low nationwide, but Covid levels are 'moderate', according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that as colder weather hits, people will spend more time mixing indoors, allowing respiratory viruses to spread easily between individuals. They say levels are currently low because the nation is in the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, infections, hospitalizations and deaths from respiratory viruses tend to peak between December and February, before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 40million Americans were infected with the flu, while 400,000 were hospitalized and 25,000 died from complications linked to their infections, in what the CDC called 'one of the worst' flu seasons in over a decade. In that year, cases peaked in early February, before gradually declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North Carolina, the state recorded its worst flu season last year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, registering 544 fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's Department of Health revealed the flu fatality in a press release posted online on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes after six counties in California, including Sonoma County (shown above), reimposed their mask mandates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now urging all residents aged six months and over to ensure they receive a flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also said Covid vaccines were recommended for everyone aged six months and over, even after the Robert F Kennedy-run CDC shifted its guidelines to recommend Covid vaccines to those aged 18 years and older. The agency says parents of children aged six months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the CDC shows that in the week to September 20, the latest available, there were eight flu-related deaths recorded nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is outside the start of the 2025 to 2026 flu season, which the CDC says begins in October, but indicates that flu deaths were likely recorded elsewhere in the US this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wake County Director of Nursing, Tina Payton, with Wake County being the North Carolina County for Raleigh, the capital of the state in its central area, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc11.com/post/flu-death-2025-season-nc-person-dies-related-illness-first-influenza-vax-urged-wake-opens-clinic/17965330/"&gt;ABC11&lt;/a&gt;: 'We see more respiratory illnesses as it gets colder and we're headed into that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives you a chance to build your immunity before the holidays come up, and that's always a big time where people get together indoors and there's a higher opportunity for illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes after at least six counties in California's Bay Area&lt;span&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the North Carolina Department of Health shows the proportion of ED visits due to respiratory viruses over the last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flu activity remains minimal across much of the US, although it has ticked up slightly in four states, Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina and Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting November 1, each will require health workers and, in some cases, visitors or patients, to wear face coverings in medical settings used by frail, ailing or vulnerable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mandate in Sonoma County has been set to be renewed every year unless it is repealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are scant reports of other counties considering face mask mandates at present, although experts say this may shift as cooler weather approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data for North Carolina shows visits to the state's Emergency Departments for a respiratory disease dropped to 5.4 percent of the total in the week to October 4, the latest available, down from 6.4 percent in the previous seven-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid-like illnesses, infections that are suspected to be Covid but are not confirmed, were the most common reason for ED visits, behind 1.8 percent in the latest week, followed by flu-like, at 0.6 percent, and RSV-like, at 0.2 percent, with both of these also being infections suspected to be down to these diseases that had not been confirmed via tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining 2.8 percent did not have the type of respiratory virus they were suffering from determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:52:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOYVR5azhudXl4aGhvT29EMVdSWXZLQVpoWGZMV3d5OElPbDZ3VXZ1RnpWOUJjdC1ZZ2Q0TjM5RTg4bXJsRVVZZjlVVGxJVzN3VUtlc1R3ZV9xTHBzMTl3S1ExZUtEdjZlaEVwWFNsSlcwcHlSN0tVeGpFczlBX19RZzJFX3NEOHBWNTNFYlFHRy1SQdIBlwFBVV95cUxPV0dnYkp4RDFNcmdGaVRfbzhaSWdHeVlKNXlRQThwOWE1c1pqU25HYU53clp2RFRzOGJaNnlJajdxY3pZUHdCcHdpOTJMVzNSVmZhbmlTZDFZUmsyVWhncS1USTB3dzh6SkdwbHRWTksyT2piaU1CUFB4blRqSk1Gc0Y3eFlKd1dmbW4xaGZiclF3eC13REJj</guid></item><item><title>由于“绝对数字” ，专家发出警报，致命的罕见癌症在年轻人中激增-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15178747/breast-cancer-rising-women-American-Cancer-Society.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are warning that rates of a rare but highly deadly cancer are on the rise in the US, with cases climbing three times faster than other forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key finding from 2012 to 2021 was that the invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a type of breast cancer, incidence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13912601/doctors-warn-cancer-rate-rising-young-people.html"&gt;climbed at an average&lt;/a&gt; annual rate of 2.8 percent in women 50 and older and 2.9 percent among women younger than 50.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This rise across age groups exceeds the 0.8 percent increase for all other breast cancers combined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The period from 2016 to 2021 was most concerning, showing an even sharper annual increase of 3.4 percent. Hormonal and lifestyle factors, not genetics, are the primary drivers behind the rising rates of invasive lobular carcinoma, experts say.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the American Cancer Society reported this week that the steepest rise in lobular breast cancer cases was among Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) women, with an increase of 4.4 percent per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this rapid increase, white women still have the highest overall case rate with nearly 15 cases per 100,000 women, compared to 11 per 100,000 among Black women and approximately seven per 100,000 among AAPI women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Angela Giaquinto, an associate scientist for cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said: ‘Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lobular form of the disease appears to grow in ways that differ from the other breast cancers, with cells proliferating in dispersed patterns as opposed to forming a lump typical of other cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lobular breast cancer grows differently than other breast cancers. Instead of forming a distinct lump, its cells spread in dispersed patterns. This makes it more difficult to detect through traditional mammograms and physical exams (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The growth pattern of ILC doesn't make it categorically more aggressive in terms of metastasis, but it makes its spread differently, sometimes later, and to unusual locations, which poses unique &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14150127/mammogram-cancer-incurable-Doctors-reveal-harder-spot-stop-happening-YOU.html"&gt;challenges for detection&lt;/a&gt; and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed national cancer data, comparing invasive lobular breast cancer cases against all other types to track incidence trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized software, they calculated rates and tested for statistical differences in trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also compared patient and tumor characteristics between lobular and ductal cancers and analyzed their ten-year survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While ILC has a similar five-year survival rate to other breast cancers, its long-term outlook is less favorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ten-year survival rate is lower, largely because ILC has a higher risk of late recurrence and tends to spread to uncommon sites in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For lobular cancer that has spread distantly, the 10-year survival rate is only 12.1 percent compared to 19.6 percent for the more common ductal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lobular breast cancer is becoming more common, and its long-term survival rates are low once it spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to finding that rates of ILC are rising over three times faster than all other breast cancers, its slight survival advantage in the first few years disappears over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giaquinto said: ‘Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for [lobular breast cancer] than the most common type of breast cancer, highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This chart tracks lobular breast cancer diagnosis rates across different racial and ethnic groups in the US from 1975 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White women had the highest rates across every age group, with risk peaking between ages 70-79 before declining&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors conclude that ILC's unique biology, which makes it harder to detect and potentially less responsive to chemotherapy, requires specific research and clinical attention to improve these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior researcher Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director for cancer surveillance research at the ACS, said: ‘Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are occurring consistently across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uniform pattern is notable because ILC is rising at similar rates in both younger and older populations, unlike some other breast cancer types that typically show more variation between age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pointed to hormonal and lifestyle risk factors as the main drivers of the increasing incidence over genetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ILC is described as being ‘more strongly associated with female hormone exposure’ than other breast cancers, evidenced by a steeper drop in ILC cases when menopausal women’s use of hormone therapy went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart tracks ten-year ILC survival from 2007 to 2021. While early-stage ILC shows better survival, distant-stage disease survival plummets to just 12 percent compared to 20 percent for ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also specifically pointed to the impacts of increasing rates of excess body weight, a younger age at first menstruation and having fewer children or having a first birth at an older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors that extend a woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen, such as a later age at menopause, along with increased alcohol consumption in some groups, are also identified as significant contributors to the growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70061"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the American Cancer Society.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Siegel concluded: ‘Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The scientists report that those who received a shingles vaccine shot were at a definitive health advantage over the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were less likely to receive a new dementia diagnosis during the next seven years. The analysis made use of a policy quirk to compare people born just before and after a vaccine eligibility cutoff in 2013. This helped separate cause from coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/varicella-zoster-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VZV&lt;/a&gt;) can go quiet in nerve cells for decades. Later, it can return as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herpes zoster&lt;/a&gt;, better known as shingles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovery from chickenpox, the virus stays latent in the nervous system and can reactivate as immunity wanes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-actually-tested"&gt;What the study actually tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Pascal Geldsetzer at &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, who studies large health datasets to answer practical questions in medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team focused on people who turned 80 in late 2013, because a small birthday difference determined who could get the shingles vaccine that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this a natural experiment. It was a real-world situation that mimicked a trial because a rule or cutoff split otherwise similar people into different groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those just old enough to miss the program served as a comparison group for those barely young enough to be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing near identical birth cohorts, the analysis made it less likely that differences in health habits or clinic access explained the result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That design choice strengthened the case that the shingles vaccine itself mattered for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-drug-helps-protect-memory-in-brain-diseases-like-alzheimers/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a really striking finding,” said Geldsetzer, summarizing the signal they kept seeing across checks and sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-shingles-vaccine-lowers-risk-more"&gt;New shingles vaccine lowers risk more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea is simple – fewer viral reactivations may mean less inflammation near nerves and blood vessels that serve the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea is broader – vaccination can tune immune pathways that influence brain health in ways not limited to one microbe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; compared the older live vaccine, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/zostavax/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zostavax&lt;/a&gt;, with the newer recombinant vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/shingrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shingrix&lt;/a&gt;. Shingrix was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of dementia than Zostavax. It also had a lower risk than other common adult vaccines in similar age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shingrix includes an adjuvant, a substance that heightens the immune response to a vaccine’s antigen. That extra kick could be one reason the newer shot shows a stronger association with brain outcomes in population data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Welsh analysis and other large population studies point toward the same conclusion. Shingles vaccination appears to do more than prevent shingles, and the newer recombinant vaccine could be even more effective in lowering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-shingles-vaccines"&gt;What this means for shingles vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax used a weakened form of the virus and is no longer the routine shingles vaccine in many places. Shingrix, which is a recombinant vaccine given in two doses, has replaced it in standard adult schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax and Shingrix both aim to prevent shingles, yet they work differently. Zostavax uses a live, attenuated virus, while Shingrix uses a viral protein plus an adjuvant to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-trick-immune-system-into-stronger-vaccine-response/"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; the immune system more directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical takeaway is simple. A shingles vaccine remains a tool to prevent shingles. Any added protection for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; is a possible bonus that researchers are still testing, not a reason to treat vaccination as a dementia drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh analysis used routine health records, which can miss or delay diagnoses. The design, however, focused on people born only a week apart around the policy cutoff time, which helps balance many hidden differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biology is not settled. Reduced viral reactivation could be part of the story, and immune training unrelated to the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-cases-of-tropical-virus-oropouche-spread-by-mosquito-are-recorded-in-uk/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; could be another part. Both are testable in future mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects tens of millions of people. According to a recent WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;factsheet&lt;/a&gt;, there are about 57 million people worldwide living with dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-think-about-risk-and-causality"&gt;How to think about risk and causality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies can be skewed if people who get vaccinated also do other healthy things. This project reduced that concern by using an eligibility threshold to compare very similar groups separated by a quirk of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cleanest proof comes from randomized trials that assign the shot or a placebo and follow people over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of trial would show whether vaccination delays &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; onset, and by how much, across different ages and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population level findings are useful for public health decisions. For individuals, the decision to vaccinate should still rest on the proven benefit of preventing shingles and its complications. Any decision should first be discussed with a clinician who knows your medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNnY3YS04V0pHdzhxYjBxTUZTLUdTRkhLaHk3SWlhZEpBUGJQR3NOOVd2TTBKbDF1U0J4NC1tM2JZVDhyUkhIQjFWNEh5a1FwelE0X3BuNkc4RllicFMyZDBVNUR4TTVvYnotWVN0ZnNmS1Bta1JENFBMU0ZtRTVlV2o3T3lITEJsYnRGY3diY3pBTHk4Y2FRZUZEQ0pjbk41N1M5M1pGM0p0MkU2NVI4</guid></item><item><title>我的姻亲对我的孩子非常不负责任。我很害怕，但我丈夫说这没什么大不了的。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/10/parenting-advice-in-laws-alcohol-problem.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkyk6g4000i3b7814enbbz0@published"&gt;You have every right to put your foot down and say that your minor son should not be drinking under any circumstances. However, try to be understanding of your husband’s position; his parents let him drink as a kid and thus, he doesn’t see a problem with it. His family’s position isn’t exactly unique, as there are some folks who think it’s better to let a young person experiment with alcohol at home than to let them discover it on the streets. Explain to him kindly that drinking a beer with family can easily be a gateway to sneaking booze behind your backs and that you do not want to send your son the message that drinking at 15 is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

Let your in-laws know that you are not wavering on your stance, and that your boys can’t visit with them until you have their word that they won’t allow them to drink until they are of age. Tell your sons that your rule may not be fun, but it is designed to keep them alive and from harming others. Everyone can be mad at you if they want, but you know that what you are doing is in your children’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkydfiz000ki0j8yyijt6l7@published"&gt;When I first met my husband, he told me he’d never touched a drink, never smoked, and never taken any sort of drug. He had a family history of addiction, and having seen what it does to people, he decided it probably wasn’t worth it. As someone who never became addicted to alcohol but partied a bit too hard in my early 20s, I really respected that. He never asked that I not drink, though by the time I met him, I wasn’t going out often anyways. Over time, his relationship with his alcoholic mother grew worse until we had to cut her out of our lives entirely, and his sister recently died of a drug overdose. He’s since become a health fanatic. We have three kids between the ages of 13 and 9. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/health-obsessed-dad-parenting-advice-from-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He’s now obsessed with perceived unhealthiness in our family, and it’s doing something really strange to our kids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it gets worse: Hypertension also increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. And heart disease, stroke, and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., respectively. Unfortunately, only one-in-four people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean, and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why did blood pressure guidelines change?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prior to this new statement were in 2017;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed: The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120 to 129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130 to 139/80 to 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this change may impact millions of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria, and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT — short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; — to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What’s the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been consistently drinking excessive amounts of alcohol but later stop drinking, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:their blood pressure may come back down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That might not sound like much of an impact, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt;, compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults — with or without hypertension — consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:need to increase physical activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regular exercise also helps you &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/aging/how-to-live-longer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:live longer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;live longer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history, and blood pressure, to determine risk.

But it’s &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eight essential health behaviors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall: These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change, since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Cornwell is an associate professor of cardiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many survey-based studies have been conducted to try to understand how happiness changes over a person's lifetime. While there have been a few different outcomes, the most common has been the U-shaped curve. This pattern indicates that, on average, people are happier at the beginning of adulthood, they experience a dip during midlife (the so-called "midlife crisis"), and happiness then increases again in old age. Yet, other similar studies have reported inconsistent patterns—steady happiness throughout life, steady increases, steady decreases or even inverse U-shapes.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Now, Fabian Kratz and Josef Brüderl from Ludwig the Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, argue that the widely reported U-shape is largely an artifact of methodological biases, instead of a robust empirical pattern. Their study, recently &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaf038/8262529" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;European Sociological Review&lt;/i&gt;, describes a different pattern, in which happiness declines slowly through adulthood, slightly increases in the early 60s (or the "golden ages"), then declines steeply in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the team sought to find an explanation for the variance among studies in happiness versus age patterns and to determine a set of "best practices" for working with these kinds of studies. They used &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/survey+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;survey data&lt;/a&gt; from the long-term German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), taken from 1984 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say, "The social sciences have faced a challenge regarding the replication of research findings, raising concerns about the credibility of results. An illustrative case pertains to research on age-related changes in subjective well-being (SWB)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to remedy this problem, they decided to take a different route than their predecessors. "This study aims to demonstrate how insights from the modern causal inference literature can help explain the contradictory findings in this research field. We use these insights to develop a theoretically informed and empirically validated &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/research+design/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;research design&lt;/a&gt;, to which we refer as the 'best-practice design.'"&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work involves identifying a set of common biases, including things like social desirability, in which participants report higher happiness levels due to societal expectations. Survivorship bias is another common problem in these studies. As people get older, those that are unhappy tend to have more &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt; or may die by suicide, leaving the healthier and happier people to continue filling out surveys, and thus creating the upward happiness trend in late life.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to avoid overcontrol, by not controlling mediators like health or employment. They say, "Overcontrol occurs when analysts control for mediating variables—i.e., variables caused by age that also affect SWB. A growing body of causal inference literature clearly demonstrates that controlling for mediating mechanisms distorts estimates of total causal effects. The rationale is clear: including such variables distorts the causal effect by explaining away part of its mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove that these biases lead to the results from prior studies, the team also replicated older results using different combinations of biases and what they believe were misspecifications of data. They say the U-shape is a common result of these designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, their improved best-practice design results in the steep decline of happiness after the late-60s. They also find no evidence for the midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, our findings do not support the notion of a U-curve, at least not in the sense in which it is often conceived. There is no basis for concluding that people in old age become happier again. Even the small increase during the golden ages can hardly be interpreted as evidence of a U-curve, since SWB remains well below happiness levels in the 20s, and the sharp decline follows immediately. Furthermore, we would argue that the dip in happiness around age 58 can hardly be interpreted as an indication of a midlife crisis, since the decline in happiness is gradual throughout adulthood," the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is no definitive, objective way to measure happiness. Subjective reports may be unreliable, and even if they are not, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/happiness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;happiness&lt;/a&gt; over a lifetime can also vary by culture and location. The study authors note these limitations, as their data is only based on German surveys. They also note that compositional variables or contextual factors may not be fully captured.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-6b0305f0-a5d6-11f0-b5dc-0395410c7ef4"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recorded 2,168 cases of congenital syphilis. By 2024, that number rose to 3,941. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the agency, this is the highest number of cases of the disease since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the rise is being driven by lack of access to general medical care and education, as well as by pregnant women not receiving prenatal care and testing and not following up with treatment after testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of pregnant women who tested positive did not receive any or adequate treatment, according to new CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of congenital syphilis have more than tripled in recent years, with 3,882 cases reported in 2023 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women’s sexual partners who don’t receive STD screening or treatment also contribute to the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many infected people will show no symptoms of the infection.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-three percent of birth parents did not receive syphilis testing during their pregnancy and 23 percent were not treated for a positive case. This contributed to almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases across the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For nine in 10 cases of the STD in infants, testing and treatment during pregnancy might have prevented the transmission of the potentially deadly disease to newborns, Johns Hopkins estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the outbreak, the city of Baltimore awarded Johns Hopkins $225,000 in 2024 to help provide testing and care to at-risk or infected individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Head of Johns Hopkins' Center for Communication Programs August Summers said during the announcement: 'We will be bringing awareness about the issue to Baltimore, both to people who are pregnant and their partners who likely also need treatment, as well as to providers to help improve counseling and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a possibility of infant death, and that’s really what we want to prevent above all else.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis is an STD contracted during sex that causes skin rashes and sores &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary syphilis sores begin at the infection site such as the mouth or genitals. Secondary syphilis rashes appear on the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis can cause symptoms such as bone deformities, jaundice, rashes and lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both syphilis and congenital syphilis are preventable by using condoms during sex and can be treated by the antibiotic penicillin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When left untreated, the disease can lead to neurological problems, premature and stillbirths, and after-birth death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health agencies have recommendations for syphilis testing, providing self or at-home STD tests to expand the options for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health, said officials were focused for years on the pandemic, rather than on congenital syphilis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every state recommends a test in the first trimester, 18 states recommend it for the third, and nine recommend it post-birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only eight states mandate syphilis screenings after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, syphilis rates among African Americans are some of the highest in the US and Baltimore's population is 60 percent African American. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic may have also played a part because health leaders were more focused on Covid than other infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/congenital-syphilis-babies-sti-mothers-YJVMTFAMPJGMTE4CNYOARG3OXI/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Baltimore Banner: 'We went through the pandemic, and our eye was not on congenital syphilis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC states: 'Increasing rates of syphilis among babies reflect a failure of the US health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Testing for and treating syphilis during pregnancy more than 30 days before delivery can prevent this infection in newborns. Too many people are not being tested and treated early enough during pregnancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only cure for congenital syphilis is the antibiotic benzathine penicillin, which is administered by injection. However, it is currently facing a worldwide shortage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This pattern differs enough from that of neurotypical adults that a machine learning algorithm was able to accurately classify individuals with ADHD based on these visual traits with over 90 percent accuracy. The same approach was also able to distinguish whether a person with ADHD regularly takes stimulant medication. These findings indicate that ADHD may involve a consistent, underlying difference in how the brain handles brief moments of perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It affects around 3 to 4 percent of Canadian adults and about 2.6 percent of adults worldwide. While researchers have known for some time that ADHD influences attention, memory, and executive functioning, less is known about how it affects the brain’s handling of incoming sensory information—especially how that processing changes from one moment to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies using brainwave recordings have shown that people with ADHD often display different patterns of electrical activity, particularly in the alpha and theta frequency bands. However, these findings have not always been consistent. To better understand the functional impacts of such oscillations, the researchers behind this new study used a method called random temporal sampling, which allows them to track how efficiently someone processes visual information across tiny slices of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to explore whether ADHD is associated with a distinct rhythm or timing in visual perception, which could reflect underlying neural oscillations. If such a rhythm exists and is consistent across individuals with ADHD, it could provide a new behavioral marker for identifying the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In light of the relatively high incidence of ADHD, there is surprisingly little that we know about it for sure,” said study author Martin Arguin, a professor of psychology at the University of Montreal and director of &lt;a href="https://www.neurocognitionvisionlab.org/en" target="_blank"&gt;the Neurocognitive Vision Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially true of the neural bases of the disorder. My lab had recently brought to maturity the technique of random temporal sampling, which serves to capture temporal variations in perceptual efficiency. Given that these temporal variations can be assumed originate from oscillatory neural activity, we thought that examining ADHD from this perspective might bring a positive contribution to our knowledge of the disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited young adult participants from two colleges in Quebec. A total of 49 people were included in the final analysis: 26 were neurotypical controls and 23 had received a formal ADHD diagnosis. Among those with ADHD, 17 regularly used stimulant medication while six did not. All participants had normal or corrected vision and completed a battery of visual tasks under controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central experiment involved briefly showing participants a series of five-letter French words overlaid with visual noise. The visibility of each word varied rapidly during the 200 milliseconds it appeared on the screen. Participants were asked to read the word aloud, and researchers recorded whether they were correct. The contrast of the noise was continuously adjusted so that each participant would average about 50 percent correct responses, ensuring a balanced challenge across individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What set this experiment apart was how the noise varied. It wasn’t static; instead, the signal-to-noise ratio changed throughout the 200-millisecond window in a pattern composed of multiple sine waves at different frequencies. This random fluctuation allowed researchers to analyze how well participants could extract the word at each moment in time, depending on the frequency of the noise changes. The technique generated what are called classification images—maps showing how efficiently each person processed the visual input at different times and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the classification images of those with and without ADHD, the researchers could examine whether there were consistent group differences in the rhythm of visual processing. They then used a machine learning model trained on features extracted from these classification images to see if it could distinguish between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification images revealed consistent differences in visual processing patterns between participants with ADHD and those without. Although the general structure of visual processing looked similar across both groups, certain frequencies showed marked differences. These included processing oscillations at 5, 10, and 15 cycles per second (Hz), particularly when the noise in the stimulus oscillated at 30 to 40 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immediate implication of our results is that, in ADHD, there seems to be a systematic divergence in visual function from that of individuals with typical development,” Arguin told PsyPost. “This divergence points to a difference in brain function that has yet to be clearly determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these patterns were fed into a machine learning algorithm, it was able to classify individuals as either ADHD or neurotypical with 91.8 percent accuracy, using only about 3 percent of the total features. The sensitivity (the algorithm’s ability to correctly identify ADHD participants) was over 96 percent, while its specificity (the ability to correctly identify neurotypical individuals) was 87 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The literature largely emphasizes the individual differences among persons with ADHD as a potential indicator of varied causes for the disorder,” Arguin said. “Our findings rather indicate that we can actually classify 100% of our participants into their respective group (i.e. ADHD vs typical development) from their individual data patterns pertaining to perceptual oscillations; thereby pointing to a possibly unique cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This high classification rate in itself was also rather unexpected. However, at the time we carried out the data analyses, we had already completed a similarly designed project comparing perceptual oscillations across young vs elderly participants with normal cognitive functioning (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1323493" target="_blank"&gt;Lévesque &amp;amp; Arguin, 2024&lt;/a&gt;). In that study too, we found an accuracy of 100% in the classification of individual participants into their respective group based on their patterns of perceptual oscillations. This somewhat contributed to raise our expectations for the outcomes of the ADHD study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether the algorithm could tell apart individuals with ADHD who were on stimulant medication from those who were not. Despite the small sample size, the model performed well, achieving 91.3 percent accuracy. It was particularly sensitive to identifying those taking medication, with 100 percent accuracy in that subgroup. Only a few features were needed to make this distinction, suggesting that regular medication use has a measurable effect on the timing of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when the researchers directly compared the classification images of medicated and unmedicated participants with ADHD, they did not find statistically significant differences using traditional statistical methods. However, the machine learning approach was able to detect consistent patterns, indicating that the medication status leaves subtle but consistent traces in the visual processing rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the findings indicate “that there is a particular pattern to perceptual oscillations that seems to uniquely characterize most, if not all, persons with ADHD,” Arguin explained. “This fact suggests that there may be a single atypical brain mechanism underlying ADHD. This is at variance from a large portion of the relevant literature, which seems to assume a variety of potential causes in attempting to account for sometimes significant individual differences among ADHD sufferers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, the study has some limitations. The sample size was modest, especially for the comparison between medicated and non-medicated ADHD participants. Larger and more diverse samples are needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. The participants were mostly young adults, so it is not yet clear whether similar patterns would be found in older adults or children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that while the classification method was very effective, the specific link between the observed visual processing patterns and underlying neural mechanisms remains unclear. The classification images are thought to reflect brain oscillations, but this assumption has not yet been directly tested using brain imaging techniques. Future studies could combine this behavioral method with electroencephalography or functional MRI to identify the brain regions and networks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that the task they used—a repetitive word recognition task with limited cognitive flexibility—may have made it especially sensitive to the effects of ADHD and medication. It remains to be seen whether similar processing differences would appear in more complex or varied tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings suggest that random temporal sampling may offer a powerful and objective tool for identifying ADHD. The ability to classify individuals with such high accuracy, based on a brief visual task, suggests that there may be a single core difference in perceptual timing that characterizes the condition. This idea stands in contrast to much of the current literature, which tends to emphasize individual differences and multiple potential causes for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the technique proves reliable in broader populations and under different testing conditions, it could eventually be adapted into a clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our investigation in adults with ADHD, we are now pursuing a related study to examine whether we can replicate its findings in children in the age range where an assessment for possible ADHD is most often sought (10-14 year olds),” Arguin explained. “If so, it would indicate that random temporal sampling could constitute an excellent test for the assessment of ADHD. Such a test could eventually prove very useful in the current context where: 1. access to the relevant specialists is often very difficult; 2. assessment for possible ADHD may be very costly; 3. the diagnosis of ADHD is based on symptomatology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310605" target="_blank"&gt;Visual processing oscillates differently through time for adults with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, Martin Arguin, Hélène Brisebois, and Nathalie Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:05:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOU2FFY2o2Qi12cWUwcDRPeXYzRk5DeGxTUklkYTl2OHZwSkVFcXJCRnJyX0hiNUw0ZU1EQUpXU1hZdGVDWHBoNG1sT1NJSUhXS3psSGQ1RE1xSEpkTTQ0WVdoQW1vS2ctd3pLNmVWd3Z5bHFwMzJ5cEdVeDFWM1cwbWZhQnc5WlktU3pyazdQMHhiNmE0bS04bTVfNlgyckZZQmUtN2o5Q05Kc3BNQWhGTQ</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家：在治疗心脏病发作20年后，您“付不起钱让我吃”的9种美国食物- MSN</title><link>https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/nutrition/cardiologist-9-american-foods-you-couldn-t-pay-me-to-eat-after-20-years-of-treating-heart-attacks/ar-AA1OdES0</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

While you can’t eliminate it, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manage it, and adaptogens like ashwagandha can help. The best ashwagandha supplements work in tandem with healthy lifestyle habits that can naturally tackle stress like balancing blood sugar, taking walks outside, breath work, spending time in nature, meditating, journaling, and more. “Ashwagandha is an important rejuvenating herb in Ayurvedic medicine thanks to its ability to nourish, restore, and promote longevity,” explains Ayurvedic nutrition and well-being expert  &lt;a data-offer-url="http://www.jasminehemsley.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.jasminehemsley.com/"}' href="http://www.jasminehemsley.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jasmine Hemsley&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the plant has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, it’s becoming more and more mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ProductSummaryGridWrapper-bJtJNc eqjcje"&gt;&lt;h2 class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ProductSummaryGridTitle-ceGaGn deqABF bpDRoa hsCmuX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue’s&lt;/em&gt; Favorite Ashwagandha Supplements:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason is that it’s an adaptogen, meaning it’s a natural remedy that can help the body cope with daily stress. “It’s traditionally used to help the body manage stress and help calm the nervous system by regulating the body’s stress response over time,” explains naturopathic physician, functional medicine doctor, and chief science and nutrition officer at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://drinkag1.com/learn/agz" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://drinkag1.com/learn/agz"}' href="https://drinkag1.com/learn/agz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AG1&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.drralphesposito.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.drralphesposito.com/"}' href="https://www.drralphesposito.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ralph Esposito&lt;/a&gt;, IFMCP. “Consistent clinical evidence supports its benefits for relaxation and sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better sleep, less stress, and total relaxation?

We consulted with nutritionists, Ayurvedic well-being experts, and naturopathic physicians to give us all the intel and break down the best ashwagandha supplements to try now. Everything you need to know, below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In this story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrative Therapeutics Cortisol Manager&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; Registered dietitian and wellness advisor for The Lanby &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.thelanby.com/team/taylor-fazio" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.thelanby.com/team/taylor-fazio"}' href="https://www.thelanby.com/team/taylor-fazio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Taylor Fazio&lt;/a&gt; often recommends Integrative Therapeutics’s Cortisol Manager for patients with elevated &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cortisol-addiction" target="_blank"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; or difficulty falling asleep. “It contains Sensoril, a root-and-leaf extract with a higher concentration of withanolides, making it especially helpful for stress reduction and sleep support,” she says. Sensoril is a patented form of ashwagandha that’s been &lt;a data-offer-url="https://scispace.com/pdf/a-standardized-withania-somnifera-extract-significantly-cvi6irtjrc.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://scispace.com/pdf/a-standardized-withania-somnifera-extract-significantly-cvi6irtjrc.pdf"}' href="https://scispace.com/pdf/a-standardized-withania-somnifera-extract-significantly-cvi6irtjrc.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;well-researched&lt;/a&gt; for its effects on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3897003/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; support. “Adults dealing with ongoing stress, mild anxiety, fatigue, or sleep issues may benefit most from ashwagandha,” adds Fazio. “But, as always, consult with a trusted medical provider before taking a new supplement to ensure it is right for your goals and clinical profile.” This gluten-free, dairy-free vegan tablet is also supercharged with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-l-theanine-supplement" target="_blank"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;, another stress-balancing adaptogen, for total relaxation amidst the most turbulent of days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Sensoril, L-theanine,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Tablet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 tablets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; NSF-certified, cGMP-certified, ISO accreditation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Ritual Stress Relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing is for certain—modern-day life means you can’t escape stress—it’s unavoidable and present at pretty much every turn. With constant overstimulation and minimal relaxation, our bodies amp up cortisol production to deal, which can be harmful when those levels stay elevated over long periods of time. However, while cortisol often gets a bad rap, balanced levels are essential for key functions like metabolism, blood pressure, and more. Fortunately, Ritual’s capsule is a brilliant line of defense against stress—with a special time release capsule that works instantly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; over the span of four and eight hours respectively, by releasing a special combination of ashwagandha, L-theanine, and saffron to fight stress, which supports balanced cortisol levels overall. “Ashwagandha has been shown to lower cortisol levels, reduce perceived stress and anxiety, and improve sleep quality,” Fazio says. “It may also help with energy, focus, and immune support by working on the same stress pathways.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Shoden Ashwagandha, Suntheanine L-theanine, affron Saffron Extract&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-GMO Project verified, ClimeCo certified, Clean

it:&lt;/strong&gt; By reverse-engineering the biology of sleep, the team at Athletic Greens researched the core systems that influence good sleep, including clinically studied nutrients and botanicals that support those tentpoles. “For AGZ, we identified six key systems that impact sleep, and carefully mapped them to ingredients, including the stress system (HPA Axis) which ashwagandha supports,” explains Esposito. “This multisystem approach supports sleep in a 360-degree way through three different phases of rest—calming the body in the evening, improving sleep quality through the night, and helping you wake up feeling more refreshed.” Made with ashwagandha (5% withanolides), saffron, L-theanine, Magtein magnesium L-theronate, and chamomile flower extract, it’s basically a great night’s sleep in a tiny packet. There’s three delicious flavors—mixed berry, chocolate, and chocolate mint—so you’ll find one version tailored to your taste preferences. Use a frother to blend it with four ounces of water or milk (again, your choice) that’s cold, room temperature, or warm. Use one packet right before bed to signal your brain and body that it’s time to begin winding down and doze off to dreamland.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashwagandha, saffron, L-theanine, Magtein magnesium L-theronate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 packet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; NSF-certified, third-party tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Emotional Balance:&lt;/strong&gt; Thorne Ashwagandha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; With a concentrated dose of the bioactive components of Shoden ashwagandha (both root and leaf), this extract is standardized to 35% withanolide glycosides. “When looking for ashwagandha for sleep or stress support you want to look for one that is standardized to &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;withanolides&lt;/a&gt;,” Esposito says. “These are the active constituents that have been studied for their restorative and rest promoting effects.” Thorne has long been a favorite among doctors and physicians for their transparency and stringent testing, making it an easy choice for anyone looking to support physical, mental, and emotional health. “This option from Thorne is a high-quality, well-tolerated formula that provides standardized ashwagandha in a clean, reliable supplement,” says Fazio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashwagandha extract (root, leaf)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; One capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; NSF-certified, third-party tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Moon Juice Ashwagandha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; Known for their incredible adaptogen supplements, Moon Juice has a few different offerings made with ashwagandha, but none are more powerful or potent than this finely milled 100% ashwagandha powder. It’s made with only a single ingredient—an organic, super-concentrated root-only ashwagandha extract called KSM-66—which has shown to reduce levels of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4103/0253-7176.106022" target="_blank"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; (the stress hormone) as well as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270108/" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and restlessness. KSM-66 has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3573577/" target="_blank"&gt;clinically studied&lt;/a&gt; to help manage stress and improve sleep over time. For the best results, take it consistently—its not an overnight one and done. “Most people do not feel an immediate effect but instead build up the benefits over time,” explains Esposito. “I suggest giving it several weeks before assessing the full benefit.”  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic KSM-66 ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1/4–1/2 tsp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Ashwagandha Gummy&lt;/strong&gt;: Gaia Herbs Organic Ashwagandha Gummies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; For a plant-powered boost, these organic gummies taste like an apple-cinnamon donut and are naturally sweetened with apple, date, and blueberry extracts. Three gummies is all you need for a 600mg dose of ashwagandha root extract. “The most studied dose is 300–600 mg per day of standardized root extract, taken with food,” says Fazio. “You can take it in the morning for focus and energy, or in the evening to support relaxation and sleep.” And because they’re delicious, it’s easy to keep up with taking them consistently. “Consistency is key to get the best results: Use daily for at least six to eight weeks to see how you feel,” Fazio adds. It is worth noting that there are four grams of added sugars so it may not be the best option for those looking to lower sugar intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic ashwagandha root extract, cinnamon bark, ginger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Gummy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 gummies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; USDA-organic, Non-GMO Project Verified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Liquid Ashwagandha:&lt;/strong&gt; MaryRuth Organics Ashwagandha Root&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have trouble swallowing capsules, a liquid supplement is an excellent option that’s easier and more palatable to take. Formulated with glycerin and water (instead of alcohol), it comes with a brilliant dropper for precise doses. MaryRuth’s has pretty rigorous quality and testing standards, making it a great choice for anyone new to ashwagandha too. “It’s important to choose supplements that come from a vetted brand, that has clinical research, and are third-party-certified,” says Esposito. “This not only confirms the quality of the ingredient but also confirms that it is truly ashwagandha.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic ashwagandha root extract&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Liquid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 0.5 ml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; USDA organic, Non-GMO Project verified, B Corp certified, Clean Label Project certified, cGMP certified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Ashwagandha Blend:&lt;/strong&gt; Needed Cognitive Support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; Made specifically to support women at every life stage, this capsule is research-backed, thoughtfully made, and ideal for those who are feeling depleted with brain fog and fatigue. With 125 mg of the patented ashwagandha complex Sensoril, as well as nootropics like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-lions-mane-supplement" target="_blank"&gt;lion’s mane&lt;/a&gt; and reishi, it offers full-spectrum support. “In Ayurvedic tradition and now through modern studies, ashwagandha is regarded for reducing stress and anxiety by supporting the nervous system,” says Hemsley. “Modern forms of ashwagandha are capsules and tablets which are convenient, but the traditional way to take herbal remedies is with a carrier such as warm milk, ghee, or unpasteurized honey to enhance absorption.” If you’re looking to take ashwagandha the Ayurvedic way, Hemsley recommends emptying the capsules—which are already precisely dosed—into your preferred “carrier” to meet the Ayurvedic recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashwagandha, coffee fruit extract, lion’s mane, reishi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 capsules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; The Climate Label certified, B Corp certified, Clean Label Project certified, certified plastic neutral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;inline-embed name="faq" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="callout:accordion" contenttype="callout:faq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything You Need to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT jBbAVt"&gt;&lt;div id="whatis" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha is a nightshade plant whose root and leaf are sometimes used to make adaptogenic supplements. “Ashwagandha’s latin name—&lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;—will hint at exactly what it has been seen to do,” says Esposito. “Somnifera means sleep inducing and is related to the word we use today, somnolence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="benefits" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the benefits of ashwagandha?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a wide range of benefits associated with using ashwagandha—some include lowering cortisol levels, supporting lower stress levels and sleep, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270108/" target="_blank"&gt;combating anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and improving &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471731/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. “Strong clinical trials show that ashwagandha root extract can significantly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37878284/" target="_blank"&gt;lower stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improve sleep when taken regularly,” says Fazio. “However, more large-scale and long-term research is still needed.” There’s also some emerging research that shows it could help with energy, focus, and immune support by working on the same stress pathways. On the Ayurvedic front, it can help with seasonal changes in autumn and early winter too. “At this time of year when the seasons are changing, which affects our inner environment, ashwagandha can be particularly useful to strengthen ‘Ojas’ (the vital energy or "life force" that sustains physical and mental health),” says Hemsley. “It’s responsible for immunity, resilience, and vitality.” Some research attributes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829155" target="_blank"&gt;improved thyroid function&lt;/a&gt; in patients with hypothyroidism as well as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471731/" target="_blank"&gt;enhanced memory and cognitive improvement&lt;/a&gt; for adults with mild cognitive impairment and people with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="form" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What form of ashwagandha is most effective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple forms of ashwagandha and the impact really depends on what the intent for use is. “When looking for ashwagandha for sleep or stress support, you want to look for one that is standardized to withanolides,” says Esposito. Ashwagandha is rich in phytochemicals, including alkaloids and withanolides—the latter are believed to be responsible for ashwagandha’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ashwagandha is well-tolerated by most people, it’s essential to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplements—including ashwagandha. “That way you can ask questions about combining it with other medications, specific health concerns, and more,” says Esposito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="how" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to take ashwagandha for maximum benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most supplements, consistency is key in order to see any real results or benefits from taking ashwagandha. “Most studies show the greatest benefit when ashwagandha supplementation is taken consistently for at least six to eight weeks,” says Fazio. Fazio recommends capsules and tables with standardized root extracts with at least 5% withanolides. “While liquid extracts and gummies may provide convenience, they often vary in potency or absorption,” says Fazio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="howwetested" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we test and review a product, we take a holistic approach to deliver well-rounded product recommendations.
