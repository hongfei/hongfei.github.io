            A 59-year-old man arrived at the Peking University First Hospital in Beijing for a procedure when he started having severe &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/18/us/plane-heart-attack-cardiologist"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and shortness of breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600023j6nknrjzvam@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four months earlier, he had cancerous tumors removed from his bladder. Around his family, he tried his best to appear strong and avoided discussions of his health. Privately, his severe anxiety over the possibility of a cancer recurrence kept him awake at night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600033j6ni26df8rp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors said the man was experiencing takotsubo cardiomyopathy — also known as broken heart syndrome, as documented in a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2021/11120/cardiogenic_shock_caused_by_takotsubo_syndrome.37.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;2021 case study&lt;/a&gt;. The rare stress-induced heart condition has been observed primarily in women, but a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in May found that the illness may be more deadly for the men who get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600043j6n43ho2t87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thought to be caused by extreme emotional or physical events — such as learning about the death of a loved one, winning the lottery or lifting a heavy sofa — &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-broken-heart-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;, or TC, occurs when the heart muscle is flooded with stress hormones, causing part of it to “freeze” in place. As the heart struggles to properly pump blood, symptoms resemble those of a heart attack, including chest pain, heart palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600053j6nu8l3ozos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 patients hospitalized for TC in the United States between 2016 and 2020. While women accounted for 83% of the cases, men were more than twice as likely to die from the condition — with a mortality rate of 11.2%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600063j6nhl7fwnni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The differences between men and women are a very striking finding,” said study coauthor Dr. Mohammad Reza Movahed, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “It raises a new, interesting question that should really be studied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600073j6nidayie0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar to differences between men’s and women’s cardiovascular health more generally, the discrepancies in TC death rates are not well understood, Movahed said, especially because they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590093519300256#:~:text=Although%20the%20incidence%20of%20CVD%20in%20women%20is,heart%20disease%2C%20stroke%2C%20heart%20failure%20and%20aortic%20diseases." target="_blank"&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt; trends in other heart diseases. It’s widely theorized, however, that differences in hormone levels play a role.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600083j6niwawtqos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stressful situations trigger the adrenal glands to release our fight-or-flight hormones, called catecholamines. They are meant to increase our blood pressure and raise our heart rate, but extreme levels can temporarily “stun” cells in the heart’s tissue, leading to TC, Movahed explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx745600093j6nz2euge9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Men are thought to produce more catecholamines during stressful situations compared with women, possibly leading men to present with &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.030" target="_blank"&gt;more severe&lt;/a&gt; cases of TC, he suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000a3j6n73aw8tew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Estrogen, a sex hormone produced at higher levels in women, may also have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9330499/" target="_blank"&gt;protective effect&lt;/a&gt; on the cardiovascular system, making it easier to manage an extreme influx of catecholamines and reducing the risk of severe complications from TC, said Dr. Louis Vincent, a noninvasive-cardiology research fellow at the University of Miami, who coauthored a similar&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;multiyear&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34711393/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating discrepancies in men and women who had TC. Vincent was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Beyond biological differences, social factors may play a role as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000c3j6n6pav4cvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most (physicians) know about takotsubo, but they may think of it as a disease just affecting women, so the diagnosis might be overlooked in men,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and the director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital who was not involved in the study. “With misdiagnosis, care is delayed, and that can sometimes lead to worse outcomes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Men may also seek care at a later stage of illness, believing that their symptoms are manageable or may pass, said Dr. Alejandro Lemor, an assistant professor of interventional cardiology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who was also not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Deadly complications from TC include blood clots, stroke, cardiac arrest and heart failure, Lemor said. If the condition is caught early, medications can reduce the risk of having these complications, restore proper heart function and allow for full recovery within weeks, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000f3j6nn5w8xmr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Movahed’s team was able to factor for important variables like age, race, income, chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes in the findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000g3j6ntzgtrl17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, there was no patient data on other comorbid diseases, such as a history of stroke or the presence of a Covid-19 infection, Vincent said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000h3j6nbef7s07c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the new study included in-patient diagnostic data only for those hospitalized with TC, so those who received outpatient care or died later from complications outside the hospital were likely not counted in the analysis, Movahed noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000i3j6nkvdgaheg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To establish a firmer explanation for the differences in mortality rates between men and women and further test treatment methods, a more detailed dataset would be needed, Vincent said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000j3j6nnff9dwyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People should be aware in studies like this, we’re presenting findings that are based on diagnostic codes, and we’re not looking at patient procedures or lab results,” Vincent said. “But it’s powerful in the sense that it lets us look at large populations and look at trends. And I think that this trend of a higher mortality in men is worth taking a deeper look into.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000k3j6nzn2u9805@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sudden, severe chest pain or shortness of breath should always be treated as a medical emergency, warned Bhatt, who is also a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000l3j6nd9c86d2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not a time to tough it out at home or get on the internet to figure it out. … Don’t try to track down your primary care provider. Call emergency services,” Bhatt said. “Time matters. By winning those few hours, you could save yourself irreparable damage to your heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000m3j6nzfa16f5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms following physical stressors — a common cause of TC in men — should not be ignored, Movahed said, especially preceding medical events such as asthma attacks, seizures or complications from drug use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkx7456000n3j6nvtvt8sm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while TC is caused by sudden stress, Bhatt said that managing chronic stress with daily meditation or exercise can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;better cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; overall while giving you routines to fall back on in unexpected situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

He was 38, a thriving magazine editor in New York with a 7-month-old daughter whose third birthday, he suddenly realized, he might never see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The moment after I was told I had cancer, I just said ‘no, no, no,’” Jon told me in an interview just last week. “This cannot be true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The fact that Jon is still here, talking to me in 2025, tells you that things didn’t go the way the medical data would have predicted on that November morning. He has lived with his cancer, through waves of remission and recurrence, for more than 20 years, an experience he chronicles with grace and wit in his new book &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/760582/an-exercise-in-uncertainty-by-jonathan-gluck/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Exercise in Uncertainty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That 7-month-old daughter is now in college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You could say Jon has beaten the odds, and he’s well aware that chance played some role in his survival. (“Did you know that ‘Glück’ is German for ‘luck’?” he writes in the book, noting his good fortune that a random spill on the ice is what sent him to the doctor in the first place, enabling them to catch his cancer early.) Cancer is still a terrible health threat, one that is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/news-events/new-report-on-global-cancer-burden-in-2022-by-world-region-and-human-development-level/"&gt;1 in 6 deaths&lt;/a&gt; around the world, killing nearly 10 million people a year globally and over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/data/index.html"&gt;600,000 people a year in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But Jon’s story and his survival demonstrate something that is too often missed: We’ve turned the tide in the war against cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The age-adjusted death rate in the US for cancer has &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/u-s-cancer-death-rate-has-fallen-33-since-1991-heres-why"&gt;declined by about a third since 1991&lt;/a&gt;, meaning people of a given age have about a third lower risk of dying from cancer than people of the same age more than three decades ago. That adds up to &lt;a href="https://ascopost.com/issues/february-25-2024/american-cancer-society-annual-report-shows-cancer-mortality-still-declining-but-cancer-incidence-is-projected-to-top-2-million/"&gt;over 4 million&lt;/a&gt; fewer cancer deaths over that time period. Thanks to breakthroughs in treatments like &lt;a href="https://people.com/jonathan-gluck-living-with-cancer-22-years-science-saved-him-memoir-exclusive-11747490"&gt;autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy&lt;/a&gt; — breakthroughs Jon himself benefited from, often just in time — cancer isn’t the death sentence it once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="getting-better-all-the-time" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Getting better all the time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s no doubt that just as the rise of smoking in the 20th century led to a major increase in cancer deaths, the equally sharp decline of tobacco use eventually led to a delayed decrease. Smoking is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21530575/"&gt;one of the most potent carcinogens&lt;/a&gt; in the world, and at the peak in the early 1960s, around 12 cigarettes were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a2.htm"&gt;being sold per adult &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Take away the cigarettes and — after a delay of a couple of decades — lung cancer deaths drop in turn along with other &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK294316/#:~:text=As%20discussed%20in%20Chapter%2013,likely%20approaching%20500%2C000%20per%20year."&gt;non-cancer smoking-related deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as Saloni Dattani &lt;a href="https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/the-decline-in-cancer-mortality-is"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a great piece earlier this year, even before the decline of smoking, death rates from non-lung cancers in the stomach and colon had begun to fall. Just as notably, death rates for childhood cancers — which for obvious reasons are not connected to smoking and tend to be caused by genetic mutations — have fallen significantly as well, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/childhood-cancer-deaths-in-the-united-states-have-declined-six-fold-over-the-last-seventy-years"&gt;declining sixfold since 1950&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1960s, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra1400972"&gt;only around 10 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia survived more than five years. Today it’s more than 90 percent. And the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/2024-cancer-facts-figures.html"&gt;five-year survival rate for all cancers&lt;/a&gt; has risen from 49 percent in the mid-1970s to 69 percent in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’ve made strikes against the toughest of cancers, like Jon’s multiple myeloma. Around when Jon was diagnosed, the &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/mulmy.html"&gt;five-year survival rate was just 34 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Today it’s as high as 62 percent, and more and more people like Jon are living for decades. “There has been a revolution in cancer survival,” Jon told me. “Some illnesses now have far more successful therapies than others, but the gains are real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The dramatic bend in the curve of cancer deaths didn’t happen by accident — it’s the compound interest of three revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While anti-smoking policy has been the single biggest lifesaver, other interventions have helped reduce people’s cancer risk. One of the biggest successes is the HPV vaccine. A &lt;a href="https://web.musc.edu/about/news-center/2024/11/27/cervical-cancer-deaths-in-young-women-plummet-after-introduction-of-hpv-vaccine"&gt;study last year&lt;/a&gt; found that death rates of cervical cancer — which can be caused by HPV infections — in US women ages 20–39 had dropped 62 percent from 2012 to 2021, thanks largely to the spread of the vaccine. Other cancers have been linked to infections, and there is strong research indicating that vaccination can &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001774"&gt;have positive effects&lt;/a&gt; on reducing cancer incidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The next revolution is better and earlier screening. It’s generally true that the earlier cancer is caught, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35298272/"&gt;better the chances of survival&lt;/a&gt;, as Jon’s own story shows. According to one study, incidences of late-stage colorectal cancer in Americans over 50 &lt;a href="https://time.com/27261/colon-cancer-rates-have-plummeted-over-the-last-decade/"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; by a third between 2000 and 2010 in large part because rates of colonoscopies almost tripled in that same time period. And newer screening methods, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500%2824%2900267-X/fulltext"&gt;often employing AI&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href="https://grail.com/press-releases/patient-reported-outcomes-for-grails-galleri-multi-cancer-early-detection-blood-test-published-in-lancet-oncology/"&gt;blood-based tests&lt;/a&gt;, could make preliminary screening simpler, less invasive and therefore more readily available. If 20th-century screening was about finding physical evidence of something wrong — the lump in the breast — 21st-century screening aims to find cancer before symptoms even arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most exciting of all are frontier developments in treating cancer, much of which can be tracked through Jon’s own experience. From drugs like lenalidomide and bortezomib in the 2000s, which &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/mulmy.html"&gt;helped double median myeloma survival&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/darzalex-daratumumab-approved-by-us-fda-first-human-anti-cd38-monoclonal-antibody-available-for-the-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma"&gt;spread of monoclonal antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, real breakthroughs in treatments have meaningfully extended people’s lives — not just by months, but years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Perhaps the most promising development is CAR-T therapy, a form of immunotherapy. Rather than attempting to kill the cancer directly, immunotherapies turn a patient’s own T-cells into guided missiles. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/health/multiple-myeloma-car-t-immunotherapy.html"&gt;recent study of 97 patients with multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom were facing hospice care, a third of those who received CAR-T therapy had no detectable cancer five years later. It was the kind of result that doctors rarely see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“CAR-T is mind-blowing — very science-fiction futuristic,” Jon told me. He underwent his own course of treatment with it in mid-2023 and writes that the experience, which put his cancer into a remission he’s still in, left him feeling “physically and metaphysically new.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While there are still more battles to be won in the war on cancer, and there are certain areas — like the &lt;a href="/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research"&gt;rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people&lt;/a&gt; — where the story isn’t getting better, the future of cancer treatment is improving.

According to a new study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, a daily dose of &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D3 may significantly delay aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D3 may significantly delay aging&lt;/a&gt; by protecting the DNA stored in your chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing more than 1,000 people aged 50 and older from the ongoing larger &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VITAL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; randomized trial at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, researchers from Harvard and the Medical College of Georgia, found &lt;strong&gt;taking 2,000 IUs of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a vitamin D3 supplement daily over four years helped decelerate the aging process&lt;/strong&gt;. How? It turns out vitamin D3 can help to maintain the length of your telomeres, which are the protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes, like the plastic casings found on shoelaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are important because if telomeres shorten too quickly or by too much, the shortening can speed up the body’s biological aging process, says the study’s principal investigator &lt;a href="https://prevmed.bwh.harvard.edu/joann-e-manson-md-dph/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist, Chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study isn’t the first to investigate the potential benefits of a vitamin D3 supplement on telomeres, it is the largest and the longest-term randomized trial to specifically explore the subject. Here’s a deeper dive into what the scientists uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of telomeres in the aging process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to know is telomere shortening is an inherent part of getting older and occur with everyone. In fact, their length is considered a marker of cellular aging. “Telomeres keep your chromosomes stable and prevent them from fraying or degrading when cells are replicating and dividing, and this helps to prevent damage to the cell’s DNA,” says Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell division and replication is a natural biological function of aging, and when each cell divides or replicates, the telomeres shorten a bit. The shortening means there’s more of a chance the DNA in our chromosomes will be more vulnerable to damage and degradation, putting you at an increased risk of age-related chronic diseases, such as heart disease and certain kinds of cancers, including bladder, brain, esophageal and lung, says Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomere shortening is also associated with some inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The researchers were curious to see if one of the supplements they’ve been studying in the VITAL trial might have a positive response for preserving telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that we’ve seen the benefits of vitamin D for reducing or ‘tamping down’ inflammation and in lowering the risk of autoimmune diseases, in this study we were interested in seeing whether it has a role in slowing down the clock for biological aging, which is also linked to inflammation,” says Dr. Manson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-year study tracked 1,054 U.S. adults, &lt;strong&gt;comprised of women aged 55 or older and men 50 and older&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers chose to examine people 50 and older because it’s during this time when the chances of chronic diseases start to increase, notes Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals were divided into two groups: One was given a placebo, while the others took both a daily vitamin D3 (2,000 IUs) supplement and a separate omega 3 fatty acid (1 g.) supplement. To examine telomere length in the participants’ white blood cells, blood was taken at the start of the study, and again at the second- and fourth-year mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study, the two groups were identical, but at the two-year point, the researchers saw those in the vitamin D3 group had less telomere shortening. However, it was at the four-year mark where the differences really became apparent. It turns out compared to the placebo group, &lt;strong&gt;those who took the vitamin D3 supplement significantly reduced their telomere shortening, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging&lt;/strong&gt;. The omega 3 fatty acid supplement had no real significant effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possible explanation? “We found a reduction in an inflammation C-reactive protein [in the vitamin D3 group] and think the effect of vitamin D3 in tamping down inflammation may be one of the reasons for less telomere shortening,” says Dr. Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manson says her team was surprised by the magnitude of the study. “We did expect vitamin D would slow telomere shortening but didn’t expect to see such a difference in when it came to the time period,” she reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the vitamin D3 looks promising as a pathway to counter biological aging, Dr. Manson says more research needs to be done. “We always say a study’s findings need to be replicated, so we want to see if these results are the same in another large trial before public health guidelines can be changed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button"

Many people who come down with COVID are also hit with fatigue and tiredness. “An infected person can still make it through the day, but they are resting more and feel more tired throughout the day,” Hoy said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other common symptoms include a fever, chills, a sore throat and muscle aches. “Some have described recent variants as less intense symptoms as compared to wintertime influenza viruses, but both can have severe symptoms,” Hoy said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s no evidence suggesting the variant causes more severe disease or an uptick in hospitalizations or deaths, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="WHO" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683ef478e4b02a49cce70a90" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; states.

He also added that those who are low-risk likely do not need to go out and get another shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to treat NB.1.8.1 at home and when to go visit a doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people will be able to recover at home by resting and staying hydrated. While you’re sick, acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help alleviate muscle aches and fevers, Hoy said.

Over a dozen of them are right here in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MH4MH6IRUFGF3F2LSXK6ZIRZMI"&gt;However, a rise in overdose deaths involving the drug nationwide has raised concerns about its safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2MUYAJDPQZD6NBAE77MAQ7K6TE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is ketamine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X5N36QNY5JEGVMODIZSDOHR2MA"&gt;Ketamine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1970 as a general anesthetic for humans and animals. It makes the user feel disconnected and detached from their pain and environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WTMVWNH4A5DNFJWRVDEVXGZMGY"&gt;It can also induce auditory and visual hallucinations. These effects make ketamine a popular club drug, where it’s known as “Special K” or “Vitamin K.” But in those settings, ketamine is more likely to have been obtained illegally, diverted or stolen from legitimate sources, particularly veterinary clinics, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I7D44ECRF5AENAECRLNMS3UUM4"&gt;It’s classified by the federal agency as a schedule III controlled substance meaning it’s illegal to possess without a prescription because it can be abused or cause addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OP3GI47JGFDYNHCTJUR3ZGUDDI"&gt;But ketamine can still legally be prescribed by healthcare providers for unapproved uses if they determine it’s “medically appropriate” for their patient, according to the FDA. It’s similar to how the GLP-1 drug Ozempic is only FDA-approved to treat type two diabetes, but many people use it for weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MTO2R36U35GIBH2QWLPL2YJJMM"&gt;Providers may&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;suggest an off-label drug when there’s not an approved drug to treat the patient’s disease yet or when the patient has tried all approved treatments without seeing any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JNR2K4CDGBGP5JSHSPNMLRR3SA"&gt;Mitchell was in the latter category — she tried it all. She had been on a gamut of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications since her early 20s. They all made her feel like a zombie. She bounced from therapist to therapist seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3FFX3OHQCRGNVI46R7JNZDZONI"&gt;She tried alternatives to traditional therapies, too. But even three rounds of transcranial magnetic stimulation, a noninvasive procedure which uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells to improve symptoms of depression, failed to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVEMFKFXSJDKHAGMZTKQWKWBTY"&gt;“I’ve tried pretty much everything to get some relief from my symptoms. But if I got any relief, it was minimal and it didn’t last,” said Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P3Q543UJ2ZBV5O7YNVYMDPIEOY"&gt;In October 2024, she was in the throes of another deep depression when her mental health practitioner suggested ketamine treatment. Although Mitchell had previously administered ketamine to patients in her job as a nurse practitioner, she was initially hesitant to seek the treatment for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2OYAKT6IGND47C4ZXHJV67UR4Q"&gt;“I was afraid that if anyone knew, it wouldn’t look good for me,” she said, referring ketamine’s reputation as a recreational party drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5L6R4QGWEFAVVE3GNQGLLR4LRM"&gt;After an initial consultation, Mitchell walked into Keta Medical Center for her first treatment. She underwent a physical exam, medical history review, and mental health assessment. She was at one of the lowest points of her life, riddled with anxiety and horrible depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6L3YPHDHFJHRJBUGQMLT5NTOJQ"&gt;“When I started my first treatment, I just couldn’t even believe the symptom relief that I had because I was in a really horrible place,” said Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VPRHV72SARCEPD3NIWLA4IIAGA"&gt;“But the following day, I thought I was on another planet or something, because I had been feeling so awful for so long that I couldn’t believe I was actually out of such mental and emotional discomfort,” said Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3B2UVXEHLJFSDAMHZD5H3T3L3I"&gt;She completed an initial course of two infusions a week for three weeks before switching to bi-weekly sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__image"&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/QA6P7ZZ2KJHZPLG6H3MFKWGKTI.jpg?auth=c9342c01c878c7a3e8d8a2815b7e4a67c9ea3d3b3afa1af29460a3bda43c61bc&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90 500w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/QA6P7ZZ2KJHZPLG6H3MFKWGKTI.jpg?auth=c9342c01c878c7a3e8d8a2815b7e4a67c9ea3d3b3afa1af29460a3bda43c61bc&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;quality=90 800w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/QA6P7ZZ2KJHZPLG6H3MFKWGKTI.jpg?auth=c9342c01c878c7a3e8d8a2815b7e4a67c9ea3d3b3afa1af29460a3bda43c61bc&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/QA6P7ZZ2KJHZPLG6H3MFKWGKTI.jpg?auth=c9342c01c878c7a3e8d8a2815b7e4a67c9ea3d3b3afa1af29460a3bda43c61bc&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" alt="Ketamine treatment" decoding="async" class="article__image-content"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;There are two main forms of ketamine treatment administered by clinics: IV ketamine infusion and Spravato, a ketamine-derived nasal spray used to treat depression.&lt;span class="article__mm-image-credit"&gt;Keta Medical Center/Canva illustration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5UBZJ2Z26RA7XIREMMOQX7NCVA"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does it work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HUENEZRHIJBDHFI3TWYQPQMJ7Y"&gt;“Ketamine is very effective because of the unique way in which it works on the brain, where it creates new pathways in the brain, and in doing so people are able to reframe their thinking, their behavior, and their emotional responses,” said Dr. Haviva Malina, Keta Medical Center’s co-founder and a board-certified emergency medicine physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P3ZXJAGZGVE7FFWCYHPH7LZNGY"&gt;Anyone can seek out ketamine treatment. You don’t need a referral from a mental health professional to do so. Most ketamine centers in New Jersey have in-house licensed mental health providers who can provide consultations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LB2Z3VQYSFFSRKQGDQDGZ4FTMQ"&gt;As a schedule III drug, ketamine must be administered directly by a licensed medical practitioner or a nurse or intern directly under their supervision, according to the New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Law. And they’re allowed to administer it without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="77XKJ7FGP5AGFCSIHNN5L5BZ7U"&gt;Still, ketamine clinics don’t necessarily look like your average medical offices. Decorated with plants, paintings, and modern furniture, the Keta Medical Center in Oradell, for example, looks more like a therapist’s office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HHW6L7OTI5DZVGHKHN4SUVUY4A"&gt;“Everyone has their own private room.

His death put ketamine treatment under a microscope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YWBIBZ3UJ5B7PF2JMPOKJO5GIU"&gt;Like other drugs, ketamine is not without risk and can be addictive. Although still rare,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a4.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; involving ketamine and&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811221140006" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; poisonings&lt;/a&gt; involving ketamine have increased in recent years. Some studies also have shown that long term use of ketamine may result in brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39" data-gaid="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KRKPHSBPB5FRVL2IFPGV5Y3AMY"&gt;Additionally, because ketamine is not FDA-approved for psychiatric conditions, it’s left up to providers to determine the frequency and dosage of treatment. But providers say that ketamine treatment is safe and effective when delivered under medical supervision by qualified healthcare professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7C7L74YKV5E5XC6ATTLVMSVDYU"&gt;“We have strict guidelines in terms of regimens and protocols that we follow,” said T.J. Shah, co-owner of Vital IV Infusions, which offers both ketamine treatment in Chatham, Montclair, and Hoboken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ROCCZBDTPJBSFGD4L3IMM2LLME"&gt;“We give a low dose compared to what one would normally give for anesthesia, so it’s a very low chance of addiction when it’s used properly and by licensed professionals,” said Shah, a registered nurse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-42" data-gaid="inarticle-42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PKU2ER6NPRHQ7L7FNSOVUWPMGU"&gt;The center screens all patients for a predisposition to addiction.

IV ketamine, on the other hand, is generally not covered. However, Shah and Bayoh said that some of their patients have reported partial reimbursement for IV ketamine infusions, which cost $425 per session at Vital IV Infusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-45" data-gaid="inarticle-45"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BRWKJ2CHAVHJTMATBPIIIJH3SA"&gt;“Sometimes people don’t feel like themselves on oral medications, but on the IV ketamine they’ve done way better. Others have tried everything and felt hopeless, then tried ketamine therapy and it’s a complete 180,” said Bayoh, who’s also a registered nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-46" data-gaid="inarticle-46"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHASY4BBSJBSXOIJIW6GZNRYCM"&gt;Of the 8.9 million people in the United States with depression, it’s estimated that 30% have treatment resistant depression, according to a 2021 study in the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-47" data-gaid="inarticle-47"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E6V3PX2WZFCJHCQ6LR6SAIA6PA"&gt;“The way depression or anxiety is, some people just need 10 minutes of mediation, some need oral pills, and for some it’s a more daunting situation. So for those feeling at their wit’s end, that’s where ketamine can come in,” Bayoh said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-48" data-gaid="inarticle-48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:O25J34LUXVA7HM3GOCU4R2QXYA" data-fusion-component="O25J34LUXVA7HM3GOCU4R2QXYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:O25J34LUXVA7HM3GOCU4R2QXYA" data-fusion-component="O25J34LUXVA7HM3GOCU4R2QXYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-49" data-gaid="inarticle-49"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U45PTSWP4FGSTDYWXJQRC5PYIE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

On his social media, he has revealed several&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/heart-surgeon-avoid-four-things-smoking-worst-explained-411140-20250606"&gt; things that he avoids&lt;/a&gt; for the benefit of his heart, as well as how to detect&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/heart-health-advice-blocked-arteries-home-test-583718-20250119"&gt; a heart blockage.&lt;/a&gt; or whether to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/heart-health-weak-symptoms-doctor-313425-20250605"&gt;tell if you have a weak heart or not. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And this time, he has suggested avoiding a staple product of your toothbrushing routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A cardiac doctor has revealed one product he never uses (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In a recent video on his &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel, he explained: "Stop using mouthwash. This is one thing that I absolutely avoid as a cardiac surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Two reasons, number one, just like the remainder of your gastrointestinal tract, your mouth has healthy &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/science"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, and by killing that bacteria, you injure the environment in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Number two, and this I find really interesting, there's a chemical reaction with that healthy bacteria that helps control your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"And by destroying that bacteria in your mouth, you actually can cause high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a risk factor for both strokes and heart attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This isn't the first time Dr London has warned about using mouthwash, as he's previously said there's 'unequivocal evidence' that you can 'you can actually increase your blood pressure simply by killing the bacteria in the mouth', adding: "And if you have a propensity to having high blood pressure, that can even be worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that a balanced oral microbiome can contribute to improved cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00039/full"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that an ingredient in mouthwash, chlorhexidine, can kill nitric oxide (NO)-producing bacteria, which helps maintain blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Nathan Bryan, from Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, and his team reported that using mouthwash twice a day was associated with an increase in blood pressure after one week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The demonstration that the presence of NO-producing bacteria in the oral cavity can help maintain normal blood pressure gives us another target to help the more than 100 million Americans living with high blood pressure,” said Bryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Two out of three patients prescribed high blood pressure medication do not have their blood pressure adequately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;There's one product that the doctor never uses (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"This may provide an explanation as to why. None of the [current] drugs for management of hypertension are targeted towards these NO-producing bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mouthwash is a common hygiene product, but Bryan warns that the habit could be doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We know one cannot be well without an adequate amount of NO circulating throughout the body," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Yet, the very first thing over 200 million Americans do each day is use an antiseptic mouthwash, which destroys the 'good bacteria' that helps to create the NO. These once thought good habits may be doing more harm than good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 09:38:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNWkJkQkxfVUFrS0VJSWt3NUxWM3BxSERheUNDX2JRakxDUnI1QlFCV3l6Smx2enJodGRmNW85TFI1eVpobWZQbEVGOUlsLXc1LThRZTRkQndoRzVsWDQ1ZWpXckJxd0cxaE1KZHFfc21ZQzVJc3NOWjE1QjdLcFdVV3ZQRzJibmxxUm9tXzB1U09fN1EzQ3AwNG9faHJKdw</guid></item><item><title>一家主要的美国鸡蛋农场刚刚失去了90%的鸡- Bloomberg.com | A Major American Egg Farm Just Lost 90% of its Chickens - Bloomberg.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOTVBRcG4tQzNJSHhhR0gzWUNVMzA3OEk4Y3hrNUFXWlA0eG1mN3U3LTFwdmNSc3ZOaFdJNU9PZTBVX0R2UFlybllUWWd0eElFUWpwRDdnd0F2RGh6YWxPaHhSQ1Y2Q0pCbFRmZjlLTk5qYTNRYndyaFU4N3FGMkk2WkZHcEZzeWFFUE9OS0ozVXdFZkdjZVd5NE5YRThFSjNUMl9RYzB5enI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content"&gt;&lt;p class="media-ui-Paragraph_text-SqIsdNjh0t0-" data-component="paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/odd-lots/id1056200096" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Odd Lots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on Apple Podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1te7oSFyRVekxMBJUSethH?si=66d0fe8845e4474a" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Odd Lots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/oddlots" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe to the newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Egg prices have come down a lot since their recent record and bird flu has largely faded from the headlines. But the epidemic is still raging and, per one farmer, risks becoming endemic in the US. Glenn Hickman is president of Hickman's Egg Ranch in Arizona, one of the largest egg producers in the US. You might remember him from our series last year, &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/beak-capitalism-part-1-chickflation/id1056200096?i=1000677062052" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;Beak Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, in which we explored some of the thorniest issues facing the US economy through the medium of chickens. Well, news from the Hickman farm since then hasn't been good. A bird flu outbreak has led to the destruction of 90% of Glenn's chicken stock. We talk about the impact on Glenn's business, egg prices, and why the US isn't vaccinating its chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bloomberg.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 08:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

alongside other tests and observations from a trained health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This study shows how blood tests are making diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease quicker, easier and more accessible than ever before in a real-world setting,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While focused on Alzheimer’s disease, the test was evaluated in people with other

needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Currently diagnosis options in the UK are often slow, expensive and can be invasive, meaning thousands miss out on the benefits one can bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s great to see blood tests like this approved for clinical use in the US. We hope to see the same in the NHS, which is why we’re part of the Blood Biomarker Challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Blood Biomarker Challenge is a multimillion-pound research programme supported by the Alzheimer’s Society, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the National Institute for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Care Research. Its goal is to bring blood tests for dementia diagnosis to the National Health Service by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Oakley said: “Blood tests will be critical to accelerate diagnosis and give more people access to the care, support and treatments they desperately need faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We must see long-term investment in the tools and workforce needed to ensure everyone living with dementia can get an early an accurate diagnosis, which is even more important with disease-modifying treatments on the horizon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “We urgently need to improve how we diagnose dementia and it’s great to see international research working towards this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Blood tests in this study look at p-tau217 and amyloid beta 42/40 and showed the tests offered high accuracy in confirming Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This study adds to the growing evidence that blood tests can detect the diseases that cause dementia in people with early memory and thinking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“An important point to consider is that people taking part in research don’t always reflect the full diversity of those affected by dementia, who might have additional conditions or other characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That is why work is needed to understand whether these blood tests work in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the UK, studies like the Blood Biomarker Challenge are helping to build this evidence. The study is testing blood tests, including p-tau217, in thousands of people from sites across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This work will be a crucial part of making diagnosis easier and faster, which will bring us closer to a cure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 04:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOUUluVjE5bWo1dGRLWjlmcDdNNHlKX05FTUVHdlVRVGdOLVQ3R2ZMMC1xU1ZZbWVTak1XLUZqMGQxRnNBVDNPMVZBVEh5a1h0MTZjU2pFanJLaTFONGpVV1pxdU9VaEZzV2NYVE4yTjh3dVFuTUpOdXZNUHV2MXBGYUVORjFVQ2ZMb2RxV0otdjQ5Qi1KWlZVMlFaNFJiSE0wNFdHSkxwTGtIQzJMa09ZWWlpWVdIbDdESWtSZg</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，多吃这些食物可以将您的癌症风险降低8 ％ - EatingWell | Eating More of These Foods May Lower Your Cancer Risk by 8%, New Study Suggests - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1ocnFCbWNDUkg3RWotUDFVNlRPdlFqdmxFTnM1NXB4NjI3NkhzNnBPLVY0V3pUOU05WDNLN2E1NUJKQmFvUTF1NWtOeElybEg0Y3F6YnhBemZxSFpwMnBRWmFzenMzSy1GQW95T2FuaE1CM3Zm?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that eating flavonoid-rich foods supports lower risks of cancer and other diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flavonoids are compounds found in fruits, vegetables, tea and other plant-based foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tea, berries, apples and oranges were among the top sources of flavonoids in the study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and rates of certain types—including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-pancreatic-cancer-study-11745546" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;colon and pancreatic cancers&lt;/a&gt;—are on the rise, especially among younger adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While there’s no magic bullet to prevent it, diet remains one of the best tools you have to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-colorectal-cancer-study-11716723" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower your cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For years, scientists have studied how specific nutrients and plant compounds may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, combat oxidative stress and even interfere with the growth of cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flavonoids—the natural compounds found in colorful fruits, vegetables, tea and other plant-based foods—have gotten special attention from researchers. Past studies have linked &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-aging-study-11731249" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high flavonoid intake&lt;/a&gt; to better heart health, improved blood sugar regulation, and possibly lower cancer risk. But until now, few studies have looked at the diversity of flavonoids people eat—not just how much they consume.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Food&lt;/em&gt; takes that next step.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It found that people who consumed a wider variety of flavonoid-rich foods had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-may-reduce-premature-death-risk-by-23-percent-8656685" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; from any cause and were less likely to develop &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chronic diseases like heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, type 2 diabetes—and even cancer. The findings suggest that expanding the range of flavonoid-rich foods in your diet may offer more protection than sticking to just a few favorites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s take a closer look at what the study found—and what it means for your health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed data from more than 124,000 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank, a long-term health study. Participants were between 40 and 69 years old at the time of enrollment and were followed for up to 11.8 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To assess diet, the researchers used 24-hour dietary recall surveys that captured participants’ intake of various foods and beverages. They specifically focused on flavonoids—a class of compounds found in colorful plant foods known for their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What made this study unique is how it measured not just the &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of flavonoids people consumed, but also the &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt;—meaning how many different types of flavonoids they were getting from various foods. The researchers used mathematical tools to calculate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary diversity&lt;/a&gt; and then analyzed how this related to the risk of developing chronic illnesses over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants with the highest diversity of flavonoid intake had:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;14% lower risk of dying from any cause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10% lower risk of cardiovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20% lower risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8% lower risk of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8% lower risk of respiratory disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In short, people who ate a greater variety of flavonoids—regardless of the amount—tended to live longer and had lower rates of chronic conditions like cancer. The protective effect was strongest in people who consumed both a high quantity and high diversity of flavonoids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all observational studies, this one can’t prove cause and effect. The data came from self-reported dietary questionnaires, which are prone to some reporting error. The study also didn’t include certain types of flavonoid-rich foods (like specific berries), which may underestimate true intake. And since the UK Biobank participants are not fully representative of the general population, more research is needed to confirm these findings across different groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; is good for your health—but this study adds a new layer: variety matters. Researchers found that people who ate a &lt;em&gt;greater diversity&lt;/em&gt; of flavonoid-rich foods had a lower risk of cancer and other chronic illnesses, even after accounting for other health behaviors. That means it’s not just about drinking green tea every day or always grabbing the same apple—it’s about mixing it up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what does a flavonoid-rich, diverse day actually look like? You might start with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-to-drink-to-live-longer-8787658" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cup of black tea&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of berries at breakfast, enjoy an apple or some citrus at lunch, then add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8032757/grape-smoothie/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;red grapes&lt;/a&gt; to your dinner salad. The more different sources you include, the more types of flavonoids you're getting—and the stronger the potential protective effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tea, berries, apples, oranges and grapes were among the top contributors to flavonoid intake in the study, but they’re just the beginning. Think about how you can rotate these in and out of your week. Swapping strawberries for blueberries, choosing an orange over apple slices, or enjoying a piece of dark chocolate after dinner are all small moves that can add up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth considering the flip side: when your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dieting-trends-that-need-to-be-retired-11681807" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diets lack diversity&lt;/a&gt;—especially in fruits and vegetables—you may be missing out on protective compounds that could lower your risk of cancer and other chronic conditions. This study suggests that eating the same thing every day, even if it’s healthy, might not offer the full range of benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Building diversity into your diet doesn’t require a complete overhaul. Start by looking at your weekly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grocery list&lt;/a&gt; or what’s in your fruit bowl. Are there a few new things you can try? A wider range of colors usually means a wider range of nutrients—and this study suggests that could mean stronger disease protection, too.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A large new study suggests that eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-anthocyanins-11727484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;greater variety of flavonoid-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;—like tea, berries, apples, oranges and grapes—may lower your risk of cancer and other major chronic diseases. The greatest protection came from combining high quantity with high diversity. Small, simple shifts toward more colorful, plant-forward meals could support your long-term health in powerful ways.&lt;br&gt;

Now, leading health experts are calling for immediate action, warning that without early detection and a shift in medical priorities, the consequences could be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic liver disease is growing silently, and the experts have warned about the urgent need to improve detection to prevent its impact globally. In a global meeting held in Barcelona, Spain earlier this week (Jun 2025), 100 international experts issued a stark warning: millions of people will continue to go unseen by healthcare systems unless early detection and person-centred care for liver disease are prioritised without delay.

Its more aggressive form - metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), affects an estimated 5% of the general population. Those with type 2 diabetes, obesity, or other cardiometabolic risk factors are at significantly higher risk. What increases the severity of MASH is that, it often shows no symptoms, until it reaches an advanced stage, where it can progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the experts saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading hepatology and metabolic health experts have urged the healthcare systems to double the MASH diagnosis rate by 2027, because this advanced disease affects millions silently, yet is rarely detected early. Lack of early detection worsens outcomes and also increases the healthcare burden globally. The experts have emphasized about using non-invasive tools and AI-based technologies to identify at-risk patients in primary care. They also noted that effective treatments must go hand in hand with better diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also proposed that concrete actions such as routine screening for at-risk groups, integrating liver testing into regular health check-ups, updating reimbursement policies, and fostering collaboration across primary care, endocrinology, cardiology, and patient organisations, should be taken to eliminate the growing public threat by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The future of the fight against MASH lies in anticipation: not only treating advanced patients but also identifying those without fibrosis early on. This shift towards preventive hepatology is key to improving the metabolic health of millions around the world,” Jeffrey Lazarus, Head of the Public Health Liver Group at ISGlobal, and lead author of the study, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Need for a new perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, over 40 experts have released the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03759-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;People-First Liver Charter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, calling for a change in how we talk about and treat liver disease. They emphasized the need to end the stigma that often delays diagnosis and care. The Charter urges using respectful, person-first language and care that focuses on the patient, not just the disease. This shift is meant to increase empathy, reduce unfair treatment, and support global efforts to use more inclusive terms for liver diseases. Over 70 organisations have backed this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic liver disease rising in Spain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

      &lt;p&gt;Researchers say a new blood test for Alzheimer's disease has been shown to be highly accurate in detecting people with early symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists looked for two proteins - amyloid beta 42/40 and p-tau217 - and found the test was 95% accurate in identifying patients with existing cognitive impairment linked to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US study involved 509 patients in an outpatient memory clinic in Florida and was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316"&gt;published in the medical journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Alzheimer's and Dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, which has already been approved by the US regulator, was also 82% accurate for specificity, which means it could rule out people without &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/dementia-6062" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Gregg Day, who led the study, said the test was as good as existing, but more invasive, tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the next step was to extend the test to a wider range of patients, including those with early Alzheimer's who do not have any cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the two proteins, which they have identified in blood plasma, are associated with the buildup of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein can be found in our brains, but in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid sticks together and forms abnormal deposits, which are thought to be toxic to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Oakley, associate director for research and innovation at the Alzheimer's Society in the UK, said the results "suggest this test is very accurate".&lt;/p&gt;        
&lt;p&gt;"Blood tests will be critical to accelerate diagnosis and give more people access to the care, support and treatments they desperately need faster than ever before," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise that heart-healthy wheat bran can have a negative effect on bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wheat bran has high levels of phytates, which can prevent calcium absorption,” Matzkin explained. Many people eat wheat bran because it’s high in dietary fiber, which is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507301/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;keeping you regular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22872372/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;decreasing heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3213242/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;preventing colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, all important considerations for many Americans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, if you’re a consumer of oat bran (which is different from wheat bran), it doesn’t have the same deleterious effects on bones as wheat bran, according to Matzkin, as it doesn’t contain high levels of phytates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phytates are a type of &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/anti-nutrients/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;anti-nutrient&lt;/a&gt; naturally found in plants. Many of your favorite veggies and legumes (from kale and cabbage to beans and peanuts) contain compounds that reduce the absorption of other nutrients. Pseudoscience makes a big deal out of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600777/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;avoiding these compounds&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part, there’s no reason to avoid these otherwise-healthy foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans, spinach and beets also contain anti-nutrients that can decrease calcium absorption, but soaking (in the case of dried beans) or cooking (for raw spinach and beets) lessens their impact, according to Waller. “Beans and wheat bran contain phytates, and spinach and beets contain oxalates that decrease calcium absorption as they bind to the calcium,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to reduce the phytates in wheat bran, you can try &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/10/2929" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;soaking, sprouting or fermenting&lt;/a&gt; it. Since it has tons of other benefits, there’s no need to completely remove it from your diet, just moderate your intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As with almost all foods, moderation is key,” Matzkin said. “No need to completely eliminate wheat bran from the diet, but understanding that it can affect [calcium] absorption should prompt supplementation with other [calcium]-rich foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Added sugar pushes blood pressure higher, drives visceral fat, and nudges blood glucose past healthy limits. For most people, swapping table sugar for something less taxing could be a small shift with outsized benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that the switch might already be sitting on the breakfast table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at what happens when adults trade two tablespoons of refined sugar for an equal amount of pure maple syrup, and the results point to improvements in several early warning signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strawberries-promote-cardiometabolic-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiometabolic&lt;/a&gt; trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-has-invaded-our-lives"&gt;Sugar has invaded our lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans swallow about 17 teaspoons of added sugar each day, roughly two to three times the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;’s recommended cap for men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health guidelines urge keeping added sugars below ten percent of daily calories and, ideally, closer to six percent for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back is easier when the replacement tastes familiar. Maple syrup fits the bill but offers more than sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have cataloged more than 67 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-polyphenols-promote-heart-health-youthful-skin-and-a-healthy-waistline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; in the amber liquid alongside minerals, vitamins, and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maple-syrup-vs-sugar-the-test"&gt;Maple syrup vs. sugar – the test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest work, led by Dr. André Marette at Laval University’s &lt;a href="https://www.iucpq.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Quebec Heart and Lung Institute&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Marie-Claude Vohl at the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (&lt;a href="https://www.inaf.ulaval.ca/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;INAF&lt;/a&gt;), enrolled 42 volunteers aged 18 to 75 with body mass index values between 23 and 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person replaced five percent of daily calories – about two tablespoons – with either Canadian maple syrup or a flavored sucrose syrup for eight weeks. After a four-week washout, the groups switched syrups so every participant served as their own control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know from decades of research that maple syrup is more than just sugar. It contains over 100 natural compounds, including polyphenols, that are known to prevent disease in part through their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-with-milk-has-powerful-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt;,” remarked Dr. Marette. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the fundamental chemistry of maple syrup is unique, they wondered if ingesting maple syrup instead of an equivalent amount of refined sugar would differently impact cardiometabolic health and the intestinal microbiota in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Marette, “The results were extremely encouraging. I did not expect to see so many improvements of risk factors within a relatively short treatment period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-shifts-in-key-markers"&gt;Surprising shifts in key markers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks on maple syrup, participants handled an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meal-time-has-a-major-influence-on-our-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oral glucose&lt;/a&gt; tolerance test far better than when they consumed the sucrose syrup, showing a change of -50.59 versus +29.93. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systolic blood pressure edged down by -2.72 millimeters of mercury, while it crept up +0.87 millimeters on the sucrose phase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android fat mass – deep abdominal fat linked to heart disease – dropped -7.83 grams on maple syrup but rose +67.61 grams with refined sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both individually and collectively, the study findings are quite significant. The combined decrease of such key risk factors may help to reduce the risk of diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Marette enthused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a commitment to lifestyle changes and small adjustments to our everyday diets is important and can be a powerful tool in preventing future diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-maple-syrup-is-different"&gt;Why maple syrup is different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests were only half the story. Stool samples showed fewer Klebsiella species and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides pectinophilus&lt;/em&gt; – microbes tied to inflammation – after maple syrup consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Lactocaseibacillus casei&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium beijerinckii&lt;/em&gt; flourished. These shifts hint that maple’s natural compounds may influence metabolism partly through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pure maple syrup brings trace nutrients along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two tablespoons supply about 35 percent of a day’s manganese, 15 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-diets-have-more-nutritional-value-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt;, eight percent of copper, and small but measurable amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/amaranth-seeds-rich-in-calcium-and-iron-prevents-tumors-and-keeps-bones-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, thiamin, and potassium, all while carrying roughly twelve percent fewer calories than light corn syrup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined sugar, in contrast, arrives stripped of such extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With each new study, we learn more about the benefits that natural products from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-plant-species-show-great-promise-in-fight-against-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; and functional foods, like maple syrup, provide,” noted Dr. Navindra Seeram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The promising results of this first human trial provide more reasons to educate consumers about maple syrup’s many health benefits. It is truly a ‘smarter sweetener’ and a healthier alternative to refined sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-maple-syrup-data-is-needed"&gt;More maple syrup data is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size was modest, and the trial lasted just eight weeks. Even so, the consistency across multiple risk factors stands out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study was limited to a relatively small sample size (42 men and women) and took place during a relatively short period, the results are still significant,” Dr. Marette remarked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have human evidence to support replacing refined sugars with maple syrup, a natural sweetener, for preventing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/christensenella-minuta-gut-bacteria-linked-obesity-different-men-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists’ next goal is to conduct larger studies with other populations to explore how replacing refined sugars with maple syrup might impact their unique health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-the-swap"&gt;How to make the swap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping maple syrup for sugar in your diet is as simple as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the study, I would consume pure maple products regularly but not consistently,” one study participant shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have always enjoyed it. Today my routine is to replace refined sugars with two tablespoons of pure Canadian maple syrup daily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small swaps add up. Cutting just two tablespoons of refined sugar trims roughly 96 calories and more than 24 grams of straight sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing pure maple syrup in place of refined sugar, you enact a modest dietary change backed by evidence of healthier glucose responses, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, diminished visceral fat, and a more favorable gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies will refine these insights, the present trial already encourages individuals, clinicians, and food producers to rethink sweetening habits and embrace this nutrient-rich natural syrup as a wiser everyday indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone edging toward metabolic trouble, that simple switch may be one easy step toward better numbers at the next check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(24)00465-6/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:19:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPX2VZRVZDbzZqb1dzSFhIR0lVY0lCUWYzWEpXa2FWRW03X2pkX1kwVWxGVW5JZU5OSU1XNExjQmkzWmFZSWRjVjNENFRoZWRCcnE0VGRlZk1xa19qbzRROW1rMlFuMGRxTmRqV0FRcmlINU1UbktsSm5OUU0wQnpfNHRqVzZCVGM3QktkaHVYVjZuY2JqSnlObV9mNUhFUTIzQUJFYXY1VjlWV0xucXlabm9hNmNpS1NDNDdj</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告罗切斯特山诊所可能有麻疹暴露- ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4 | Health officials warn of possible measles exposure in Rochester Hills clinic - ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNX3JuTl9fakZENjF0dmp2ODgwblFyMjVCWlRwcTQ1ZGZsSWNmaFFIeXU3amRhaHpzTlhwRUVaV0xvRXpuX1R2Z0JPRmdzQjlGSVhFZXhjcWdrWU54djlEeFhpczU0T0tfSG5GTkNQMnk1WWg5SmV2YVdFaXFXWXN2N21FZ3paTzRoYlhFbTZZNmhqQnRTZ2prWG8zcXBodXdjLVRacXVPXzNXQ3EyQ0FSdmZubWNnRkRTazQzT0JOZlNRbnIyRjZydkJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich.&lt;/strong&gt; – The Oakland County Health Division is notifying the public about a measles exposure site involving a person from another county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Individuals who visited the medical office building at 3950 S.

            As measles cases in the United States continue to mount, neighboring countries Canada and Mexico are also experiencing significant outbreaks – all of which have been linked to at least one death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100043b6mb9pf6us4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Thursday, the chief medical officer of health of the Canadian province Ontario announced that an infant who was born prematurely with a measles infection had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100053b6m5hkds6gw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant contracted the virus before birth from their mother, who had not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine,” Dr. Kieran Moore said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “While measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death, the infant also faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100063b6mg87spso6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least four people have died from measles in Mexico in 2025, and three people have died in the US: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100073b6mqg2lad0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This years’ measles outbreaks are the biggest that Canada and Mexico have seen in decades, and the World Health Organization has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that the “overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high.” Low vaccination rates are a key driver of this elevated risk assessment, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100083b6m3ec1ydi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mexico has reported at least 1,520 measles cases as of late May, according to &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/measles-rubella-bi-weekly-bulletin-19-20-17-may-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Pan American Health Organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100093b6m5v0pcgpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada reached measles elimination status in 1998, meaning that there has not been continuous spread of the virus for more than a year. But there have already been more cases reported so far this year than there were in the previous 27 years combined. At least 2,755 measles cases have been reported in Canada so far this year, according to federal &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; that was last updated on Monday, the vast majority of those which have been in Ontario residents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000a3b6mx5wzf84c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the US has reported at least 1,168 measles cases so far this year, according to federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Friday – nearly 80% of which are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Canada. It’s the second highest number of cases that the US has reported since achieving measles elimination status in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000b3b6m3627dng5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Significant shares of the measles outbreaks in the US, Canada and Mexico have been concentrated in Mennonite communities that are closely connected to each other – and that have historically had low vaccination rates due largely to minimal interactions with formal health care systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000c3b6mcqzuxgwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, in a recent webinar, experts from the Pan American Health Organization did not formally link outbreaks in the three countries to each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000d3b6macxlntjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The outbreak [in Mexico] started in Chihuahua, at the heart of Mennonite communities, who were very close to Texas through the border, but they’re also close to other Mennonite communities in Canada,” Dr. Alvaro Whittembury, regional adviser for the Comprehensive Immunization Special Program, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/events/webinar-between-urgency-and-resilience-culturally-aware-strategies-address-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. “It’s important to show that although at first the outbreak starts in Mennonite communities … the vast majority of cases are outside of these communities, and they are sustained in the general population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000e3b6mxhyd4lgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only a small share of confirmed cases in the Americas have identified genetic sequences, experts from the Pan American Health Organization said, and there haven’t been enough identical sequences to explicitly link cases across countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000f3b6m6mn6qfp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Mexico issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000g3b6m7h3t18vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk and I urge everyone, but especially those who may become pregnant, to ensure they have received two doses of the MMR vaccine, which will protect both a parent and baby,” Moore said in his statement Thursday. “This vaccine has been safely used for over 50 years and is highly effective. Two doses provide nearly 100 per cent protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The folds and ridges of the human brain are more complex than any other in the animal kingdom, and a new study shows that this complexity may be linked to the brain's level of connectivity and our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-really-is-in-your-head-thinking-hard-and-long-can-cause-brain-drain"&gt;reasoning abilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research led by a team from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) looked at the brain shapes and neural activity of 43 young people, and in particular the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_prefrontal_cortex"&gt;lateral prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (LPFC) and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) – parts of the brain that handle reasoning and high-level cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grooves and folds on the brain are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_(neuroanatomy)"&gt;sulci&lt;/a&gt;, with the smallest grooves known as tertiary sulci. These are the last to form as the brain grows, and the research team wanted to see how these grooves related to cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162712" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth.jpg" alt="Sulcal depth diagram" class="wp-image-162712 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth-413x415.jpg 413w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth-600x603.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162712" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at sulcal length and sulcal depth. (Jannsen et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0606-21.2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;J. Neurosci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2022)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/05/21/are-groovy-brains-more-efficient/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Kevin Weiner, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed each sulci had its own distinct connectivity pattern, and that the physical structure of some of these grooves was linked to the level of communication &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-misunderstood-precisely-what-makes-our-brains-tick"&gt;between brain areas&lt;/a&gt; – and not just areas that were close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds to the findings &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25162-w"&gt;of a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; carried out by some of the same researchers, which found the depth of certain sulci are associated with cognitive reasoning. Now we have more data to help scientists understand why that might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 60 and 70 percent of the brain's cortex (or outer layer) is hidden away inside folds, and these patterns change with age too. Tertiary sulci can vary significantly between individuals as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162714" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3.jpg" alt="Sulcal brain maps" class="wp-image-162714 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3-509x415.jpg 509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3-600x489.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162714" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers developed models that could identify sulci with high levels of accuracy. &lt;span&gt;(Häkkinen et al., &lt;em&gt;J.

They're not just random folds used to pack brains inside skulls – and may have evolved in certain directions over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the researchers have big plans when it comes to studying brain grooves. Eventually, it's possible that a map of these sulci could help in assessing brain development in children and spotting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-severe-brain-disorder-is-common-but-often-goes-undiagnosed"&gt;neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more work to do before that can happen though, and the researchers are emphasizing that brain fold length and depth are just two of many factors involved when it comes to our cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/05/21/are-groovy-brains-more-efficient/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual's cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0726-24.2025"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research reveals exciting connections between caffeine consumption and women’s health as they age. A groundbreaking study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health offers promising evidence that women who regularly enjoy caffeinated coffee during midlife may experience better health outcomes later in life. The research specifically examined how different caffeinated beverages affect aging across multiple health domains, with coffee emerging as a potential ally in the quest for &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/21/93-year-old-man-body-40-year-old-scientists-amazed-his-fountain-youth-secret/"&gt;healthy aging strategies that can maintain vitality&lt;/a&gt; well into our senior years.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;Coffee consumption patterns and their impact on women’s health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive Harvard study tracked 47,513 women from the Nurses’ Health Study over an impressive 30-year period beginning in 1984. Researchers collected detailed dietary and health information every four years, paying special attention to caffeine intake from various sources including coffee, tea, cola, and decaffeinated coffee. This methodical approach allowed scientists to establish meaningful connections between consumption patterns and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1384396993"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sara Mahdavi, lead researcher from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Toronto, emphasized the uniqueness of this study: “While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades.” This holistic view of aging represents a significant advancement in our understanding of caffeine’s long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/26/neither-banana-nor-apple-scientists-reveal-the-healthiest-fruit-of-all-and-why-you-should-eat-it-every-day/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2016, researchers identified 3,706 women who met all criteria for “healthy aging” – defined as reaching at least 70 years while remaining free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, good mental health, and cognitive sharpness. These women typically consumed about 315 mg of caffeine daily during their midlife years (ages 45-60), equivalent to three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards. Coffee contributed to more than 80% of their caffeine intake, suggesting this beverage may offer unique benefits that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/03/a-youtuber-walks-250000-steps-in-a-week-and-reveals-the-surprising-effects-on-his-body/"&gt;positively affect physical wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-3402857608"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Not all caffeine sources are created equal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s most compelling findings is that the source of caffeine matters significantly. While regular coffee consumption showed positive associations with healthy aging, researchers found no significant benefits from decaffeinated coffee or tea consumption. This suggests that the unique combination of caffeine and other compounds specifically found in regular coffee may be responsible for the observed health benefits.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more striking was the discovery that cola consumption showed opposite effects. Each additional small glass of cola was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging. This stark contrast highlights that simply consuming caffeine isn’t enough – the delivery method and accompanying ingredients play crucial roles in determining health outcomes. For women seeking to enhance their long-term health, this research suggests that mindful beverage choices matter.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study controlled for numerous factors that might influence aging outcomes, including body weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, educational background, and dietary protein intake. This careful methodology strengthens the connection between coffee consumption and healthy aging, though researchers caution that the benefits remain modest compared to &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/26/10-strategies-used-high-achievers-stay-productive-motivated/"&gt;overall lifestyle habits that support longevity&lt;/a&gt; and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/18/better-than-nordic-walking-this-old-peoples-sport-melts-fat-with-minimal-effort-even-after-60/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking: this “old people’s sport” melts fat with minimal effort (even after 60).&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Quantifying the coffee-aging connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For women in the healthy aging group, each additional daily cup of coffee corresponded to a 2% to 5% higher chance of maintaining good health in later years, &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01522-7/fulltext"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;. This positive association held true for consumption up to five small cups daily (approximately 2.5 cups by current standards). The researchers presented these findings at NUTRITION 2025, the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting, on June 2.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi noted, “These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health. Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.” This perspective aligns with growing evidence that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/07/if-you-want-more-fulfilling-relationships-say-goodbye-these-10-habits/"&gt;daily habits significantly impact our wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; across physical, emotional, and social dimensions.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s extensive follow-up period of 30 years provides valuable insights into how midlife dietary choices can influence aging trajectories decades later. While the exact mechanisms behind coffee’s apparent benefits remain under investigation, this research suggests that women who include moderate amounts of caffeinated coffee in their daily routines may be supporting their long-term health in multiple ways.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;The broader implications for healthy aging research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This Harvard study contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that specific dietary choices can influence how we age. By examining multiple domains of aging simultaneously – physical function, mental health, absence of chronic disease, and cognitive preservation – researchers have created a more complete picture of what constitutes truly healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/02/nearly-60-years-ago-this-psychologist-discovered-the-7-38-55-rule-to-improve-emotional-intelligence/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Nearly 60 years ago, this psychologist discovered the 7-38-55 rule to improve emotional intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For women navigating midlife choices, this research offers practical guidance amidst sometimes conflicting nutritional advice. Unlike many health interventions that require significant lifestyle overhauls, incorporating moderate coffee consumption represents an accessible option that may complement other &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/15/this-simple-hack-can-help-calm-a-panic-attack-with-just-a-pen/"&gt;wellness strategies that support mental health&lt;/a&gt; and physical resilience.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s focus on women’s health specifically addresses an important gap in aging research. Women typically live longer than men but often experience more health challenges in later years. Understanding gender-specific factors that contribute to healthy aging can help &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/10/14/how-forget-someone-according-psychology/"&gt;develop tailored approaches to wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; that acknowledge physiological differences.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coffee consumption shows promise as one component of a healthy aging strategy, researchers emphasize that no single habit exists in isolation. The most successful aging outcomes likely result from a combination of factors including regular physical activity, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/28/it-grows-with-almost-no-light-needs-no-watering-and-filters-pollutants-perfect-for-dark-rooms-or-office-spaces/"&gt;environmental wellness factors&lt;/a&gt;, nutritious eating patterns, social connection, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco. Nevertheless, this research suggests that for many women, that morning cup of coffee might be doing more good than previously recognized.

Some of these cases have been linked to international travel while others remain under investigation due to unclear origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The majority of cases have been reported in Gaines county, home to a Mennonite community with historically low childhood immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two children from the affected region, both unvaccinated and with no known pre-existing conditions, have died due to the disease. The earlier of those deaths was the first in the US from measles since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas state health services department figures&lt;/a&gt;, fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases are currently considered infectious – which is defined as individuals within four days before or after the appearance of the measles rash. Since January, 94 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The state health agency has identified seven counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. The agency says it continues to work closely with local health officials to monitor and contain the spread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Shuford says that the department has struggled to adequately encourage community members to get vaccinated, explaining that the state health service department is “really trying to strengthen our messaging at all times and so that we already have a relationship with different communities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added that “vaccines are just such an instrumental way for us to maintain a healthy society that can be productive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 20:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5OWUUxWHowc1d6dWc5SGNXNzBaUUxONWNDekNNYkQ3Zk1JRk5lNXJUOTFjRUp5a2p4RHFScWhkdFRtbi1DMzRVYVRkS1pFYjNWMVJCbEdUbElFeXU0Zk9tRmd0SWdLT0JBa2dmbGo1dWZ2U21KNVVGUnp3</guid></item><item><title>他领导了乔治· W ·布什的PEPFAR计划来阻止艾滋病。现在他担心它的未来- NPR | He led George W.

   &lt;p&gt;About two decades ago, Namibia was one of the hardest-hit countries in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. More than one in three adults tested positive for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark Dybul remembers visiting a clinic in rural Namibia and meeting a woman and her baby. She was HIV-positive and was terrified of passing the virus on to the child. She named her baby No Hope in the local language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's one of the most devastating things you could ever hear," Dybul says. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A game changer&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, soon changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush created PEPFAR in 2003 and reauthorized it in 2008. Dybul was the principal architect of PEPFAR while he was at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and he was later appointed U.S. global AIDS coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR has since given out billions every year to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with programs like free drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission and widespread treatment of HIV-positive people to keep the virus from progressing to AIDS and to keep it from being spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department has credited it with saving 26 million lives so far.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/04/nx-s1-5423372/trump-wants-to-cut-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-controlling-hiv-aids" target="_blank"&gt;In an interview with NPR this week&lt;/a&gt;, Dybul tells a story about how he went back to Namibia and "here she was — and here that child was, four years later, because of the support from the American people that provided the antiretroviral therapy to her, which prevented her child from actually getting the virus" — which can be passed from mother-to-child not only during delivery but with breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71057" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dr. Mark Dybul addresses a Senate hearing on global health issues in 2015. He was an architect of PEPFAR, the program created by President George W. Bush to stop the spread of AIDS. Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and brought more stability to countries hard hit by the virus, he says.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What will happen to PEPFAR?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now the future of PEPFAR is hazy. On Tuesday, President Trump asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid that lawmakers had already approved in 2024 and 2025 budgets — including $400 million allocated to PEPFAR.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The cuts would drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's part of an ask, known as a rescission request, that would eliminate a total of $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move would codify cuts already made by the U.S Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which dismantled USAID and absorbed it into the U.S. State Department in the first months of Trump's term and dramatically reduced PEPFAR's reach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR asked the State Department to comment on the impact of aid cuts on PEPFAR. The State Department did not respond in time for our deadline for publication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Congressional decision awaited&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Congress now has 45 days to respond to Trump's memo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move comes after a March &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333.60.0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. District Judge Amir Ali that the Trump administration acted "unlawfully" by halting foreign aid without Congress's approval.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The rescission request "put the ball squarely in Congress's court," says Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention organization receiving PEPFAR funds that led the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Congress, at least to date, has moved not at all. The question really is, will they act?" Warren asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some members of Congress have signaled they want to keep PEPFAR from being slashed — so PEPFAR's future is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it has been an up-and-down year for PEPFAR. The program's work was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/25/g-s1-44762/pepfar-trump-hiv-foreign-aid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;initially halted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the days following Trump's inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed PEPFAR to resume operations again — but only or treatment of existing HIV-positive patients and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5295011/what-is-happening-with-pepfar-it-depends-whom-you-ask" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HIV prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measures for pregnant and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That doesn't represent everyone at risk for HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are still 1.3 million new HIV infections every year, which means the pool of people who need treatment will grow rapidly without more prevention, Warren says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;These cuts do "exactly the opposite of what this administration says they want to do, which is to get countries to own their AIDS response and own their budget," Warren says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We all want to see that transition, but we're making it harder for countries by not helping them reduce the burden of treatment programs. And in fact, we're going to add to it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dybul agrees.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's important to note that this was never intended to be a forever program," he says in his NPR interview. "But if we don't stay in the game, all of those gains will be lost."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Eventually we should be in a position where there is no PEPFAR. But it can't be done overnight," Dybul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He still remembers how "absolutely catastrophic" HIV was only a few decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The epidemic was particularly brutal because HIV often kills young people in the prime of their lives, Dybul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You would have entire villages run by orphans because all the adults were gone. Countries could have ceased to exist. That's how devastating it was."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and made hard-hit countries like Namibia more stable, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And U.S. assistance also offered hope, Dybul says. Because of PEPFAR, "no one would any longer name their child No Hope," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without it, there "is a hopelessness that occurs when you see everyone dying around you, you think you're going to die," Dybul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/melodyschreiber.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melody Schreiber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a journalist and editor of  &lt;/em&gt;What We Didn't Expect: Personal Stories About Premature Birth.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A tool that grew in popularity during the
COVID-19 pandemic might help communities track the flow of measles nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wastewater monitoring can serve as an “early warning
system,” according to North Carolina environmental engineer Angela Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people are spreading these pathogens in their
urine or their stool, prior to exhibiting symptoms,” Harris explained. “If you’re
only doing clinical testing of people who are symptomatic, it’s going to be a
bit delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris, an associate professor at NC State, worked closely
with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services amid early research
efforts during the SARS Co-V-2 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When we were thinking about, ‘How can we help with this
response, and how can we address transmission?’ – wastewater is a really nice
sample type that allows us to look at community level exposures,” Harris explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris said every pathogen is different. The researcher
noted measles, for example, is shed through urine and not stool.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/how-wws-works.html"&gt;Wastewater
has been used as a helpful tool to look for other viruses&lt;/a&gt; including polio
and influenza, and for looking at widespread drug use. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The researcher noted data from water treatment facilities has
proven to be particularly helpful for hospital systems – as exhibited during the
pandemic – when making  “decisions about
elective procedures so they would have space for a rising outbreak, or surge in
cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

measles across the Untied States.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The online tool offers another way to track the flow of
measles as confirmed cases hit 1,168 across 34 jurisdictions, as of June 5,
2025. At least 89% of cases have been linked to 17 different outbreaks this
year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;All states bordering North Carolina, except for South
Carolina, have now reported at least one case of measles in the last few
months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris cautioned the system isn’t without its flaws, as she
noted it is more reliable when several people within a community are sick with
the same infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Say there are
100,000 people contributing to a wastewater treatment plant,” Harris explained.
“If just one of those people is infected, we’d have a very low probability of
detecting it in wastewater. But, if you had more people infected, say 100
people, you’d be maybe 50% likely to detect it in wastewater.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The researcher also said monitoring specific facilities,
such as individual schools, hospitals, or nursing homes, could also help
provide more detailed information about a particular viral spread. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Certain buildings will have one pipe of sewage that goes to
the main line, so you can install sampling devices within a network,” Harris said. “One neighborhood – all of their waste may be funneled to a single
point in the sewer network – so you could install a sampling device pretty
easily at a pump station.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris noted data from specific facilities would also help
health departments in planning strategic and targeted community outreach
efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you are doing wastewater surveillance and you see certain
disease trends, vaccination campaigns can be quite effective in expanding
vaccination coverage to reduce transmission likelihood,” Harris said. “Schools
are another way to reach populations. If we see certain things in wastewater,
then health departments can work with schools to deliver information and to
offer vaccination campaigns.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Reducing spread among school populations is of particular
concern among health officials when it comes to measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The virus is highly contagious and can be particularly
dangerous for children. The CDC warns two out of the three confirmed deaths from
measles so far in 2025 were children. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;67% of the total cases reported across 33 states as of June
5 were in children under 19, with 95% of total cases occurring in patients who
were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-hospitals-standby-measles-threat-may-2025/"&gt;North
Carolina hospitals are on high alert amid growing concerns of a potential
measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective when
protecting against measles, mumps, and rubella, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, runny nose, and
red, watery eyes. A red, blotchy rash may also appear throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris notes wastewater surveillance will likely be a useful
tool for health departments statewide moving forward who need to track community
spread of measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It can also be helpful if we have limited case data,” Harris added. “If there is some sort of stigma around going and reporting that you
are sick, or if there is not great access to healthcare services in some areas,
this wastewater surveillance allows us to collect data that may not have the
same access to health care or to testing as other populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is one of only six states involved in the
National Wastewater Surveillance System through the CDC. Data collected is used
to help drive innovation and help researchers detect infectious diseases across
the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After a brief lull during the pandemic, whooping cough has bounced back, raising alarm among public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been more than 10,000 whooping cough cases in the United States so far this year, an unusually high number even by prepandemic standards, said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University who has studied whooping cough, also called pertussis, for decades. A branch of the World Health Organization recently called on countries with high levels of spread, including the United States, to bolster surveillance of the illness and increase vaccination efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwards said the surge was most likely caused by a combination of falling childhood vaccination rates and a lack of exposure to the disease during the pandemic. That exposure “reminds” the immune system how to recognize and defend against the bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While less deadly than other vaccine-preventable illnesses like measles and polio, whooping cough — sometimes called the 100-day cough — is not a mild illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The respiratory illness is known for causing bouts of coughing so intense that they can lead to vomiting or even broken ribs. About a third of babies who get whooping cough need treatment at a hospital. Last year, 10 people died from the infection, and most of them were younger than 1 year old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cough seizures can be so profound that you can lose consciousness and fall,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Who should get a shot, and when? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial series of vaccines for pertussis — which also targets tetanus and diphtheria — is typically given during childhood. And doctors generally recommend booster shots for adults every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because, while the current vaccine offers excellent short-term immunity against whooping cough, protection drops considerably after just a few years. (An earlier version of the shot offered much longer-lasting protection, but was phased out in 1996 because of side effects, like seizures and fevers.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure about when you were last vaccinated, Schaffner said, there is no harm in getting an extra shot within the 10-year window, “other than a sore arm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local public health officials may advise a booster shot for anyone living near an active outbreak. States on the West Coast — including Washington, Oregon and California — have reported the most cases this year, according to the latest data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And medical experts say there are other groups who may want to consider more frequent shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; If you have a young child in your life &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough, while unpleasant for adults, can be devastating for a child under 1 year old. Babies have a less developed immune system and, for reasons scientists do not fully understand, a much more severe reaction to the toxins released by the pertussis bacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the five people who died from the infection this year, four were under 1 year old. Unvaccinated children are 13 times as likely to become infected as their fully vaccinated peers and more likely to suffer severe outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria are often spread to babies by adults who don’t realize their symptoms are from whooping cough, or who don’t have symptoms at all, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to visit a child younger than 6 months old — and especially under 2 months old — experts recommend checking whether you’ve had a Tdap shot within the last five years. If not, or if you’re unsure, you should get a Tdap booster at least two weeks before interacting with the baby. This gives your body enough time to build up immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; If you are pregnant &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy can offer strong protection for babies during the vulnerable early months of life, before they are able to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Cherry, a longtime pertussis researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, said if all women were given the Tdap shot in their third trimester, as is recommended by the CDC, the country could eliminate “virtually all deaths” from whooping cough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet only about 60% of pregnant women in the United States follow this recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; If you are a preteen &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As children get further away from their initial round of pertussis vaccines, they become increasingly vulnerable to a whooping cough infection. At 11 years old, most of the immunity from their childhood shots has worn off. At the same time, children are still spending most of their days in school, where the bacteria spread readily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, more than a third of whooping cough cases have been among people 11 to 19 years old. For this reason, the CDC recommends that children get a booster shot at 11 or 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this age group is unlikely to have fatal complications, the cough often disrupts normal activities, like sleeping, eating and studying, and can linger for months after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talking about the subsequent events, Ashlee told this website: 'We were hoping for a miracle and kept him on life support so that family and friends could visit for the next two days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With no improvements, we took him off of life support on Monday, April 28, and he passed peacefully at 3.35pm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14673485/child-flu-deaths-highest-swine-flu-outbreak-cdc.html"&gt;its similar-sounding name,&lt;/a&gt; haemophilus influenzae is not a flu virus but a bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many healthy people carry it in their nose or throat without symptoms, H. flu can turn lethal if it enters the bloodstream, causing the body to attack organs. It is particularly dangerous for young children, whose immune systems are still developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;H. flu is now rare due to widespread Hib vaccination, which has brought yearly cases in the US down from 20,000 in the 1980s to just 50 today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, vaccine uptake has been dropping since the Covid pandemic and doctors warn that it could make a deadly resurgence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam was one of those rare cases. The vaccine — given over three doses to babies — is about 95 per cent effective at preventing infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although he was fully vaccinated as part of routine childhood immunizations, Liam fell into that small group for whom the vaccine isn't fully protective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Little Liam Dahlberg, eight, from Indiana , complained of a headache after coming home from school last month — the next day he was dead &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infectious disease doctors told Ashlee they believed that her son caught Hib from the cough or sneeze of an unvaccinated child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being vaccinated limits your chances of contracting the disease and at the same time limits the carriage of the disease,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, basically in order to not see this disease to this extent, everyone should be vaccinated for it because then it would be eradicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not impossible for a vaccinated child to be carrying the bacteria but a vaccinated child would not spread the disease to this extent of being fatal unless an unvaccinated child contracted the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why you don't see it very often because there are more vaccinated children than unvaccinated - but it's the unvaccinated that essentially destroying herd immunity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact source of Liam's infection will never be known for certain but doctors said the timeline suggested exposure happened between April 22 and April 24.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the family is sharing his devastating case in the hope of raising awareness about Hib - and the importance of maintaining high levels of childhood vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They don't just protect you they protect others who may not be able to be vaccinated and who may have weakened immune systems,' Ashlee said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He was diagnosed with haemophilus influenzae, also known as H. flu , which had spread to his brain and spinal cord &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The family is still unsure how Liam caught the infection — he had been fully vaccinated against H.flu as part of his routine childhood schedule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pediatricians have warned of declining vaccine uptake overall in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, though there is no detailed data as to the fall in rates for children when it comes to H. flu. Misinformation and political polarization are thought to be playing a part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there may be other reasons fewer children received shots this year, Dr Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said, citing reduced access to services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many pediatricians offices were understaffed and not holding as many after-hours vaccination clinics as in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, more Americans were seeking their vaccinations from pharmacies but some drugstores don't vaccinate children, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the medical costs that have amounted to $300,000, the Dahlbergs described Liam as 'a bright and smart young boy, full of life and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'His presence brought joy and warmth to everyone he met,' the page adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using advanced brain imaging, the researchers found that individuals with this condition showed altered activity in several brain regions related to emotion, sensation, and visual processing. These brain changes were also linked to key neurotransmitter systems that regulate reward, arousal, and muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifelong premature ejaculation is a common male sexual disorder marked by consistent early ejaculation, often within one minute of sexual activity. It can cause significant distress, affect self-esteem, and create tension in relationships. Despite its prevalence—affecting around 3% of men in China and up to 5% globally—the underlying brain mechanisms are still not fully understood. Diagnoses typically rely on self-reported measures, and objective biological markers are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers in China set out to investigate how the brains of men with lifelong premature ejaculation differ from those of men without the condition. They aimed to find measurable patterns of brain activity that could help explain why some men are affected. Their approach focused on resting-state brain function using a method called percent amplitude of fluctuation, or PerAF. This technique measures how much blood flow-related activity varies in different regions of the brain when a person is not engaged in any specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 81 men—46 with lifelong premature ejaculation and 35 healthy controls. All participants were screened for mental and physical health and were not taking medication. Brain scans were conducted using a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner while participants rested with their eyes closed. The researchers then analyzed the brain imaging data to identify regions where brain activity differed between the two groups. They also compared the imaging findings with clinical measures of sexual function, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that men with premature ejaculation had increased brain activity in several key regions. These included the middle cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, Rolandic operculum, hippocampus and parahippocampal area, and the insula. These areas are known to be involved in emotional regulation, sensory integration, and bodily awareness. At the same time, reduced activity was observed in the precuneus, inferior temporal cortex, and parts of the occipital lobe—regions linked to self-referential thinking, visual imagery, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether these brain differences could help distinguish between individuals with and without premature ejaculation, the researchers conducted a receiver operating characteristic analysis. This statistical method estimates how accurately a variable—such as brain activity in a specific region—can classify a condition. The analysis showed that some of the altered brain regions, especially the middle cingulate cortex and hippocampus, were moderately effective in distinguishing the affected group from controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found meaningful connections between brain activity and clinical symptoms. Higher activity in the insula was associated with greater depression scores, while lower activity in the precuneus was linked to poorer sexual function. These findings suggest that emotional and cognitive processes may play a role in how premature ejaculation develops and persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the biological underpinnings of these brain changes, the researchers investigated whether the altered activity was related to known patterns of neurotransmitter distribution. They used a brain mapping tool called JuSpace, which compares imaging data with maps of neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The analysis showed that brain activity patterns in men with premature ejaculation were significantly correlated with areas rich in dopamine D2 receptors, serotonin transporters, norepinephrine transporters, and vesicular acetylcholine transporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurotransmitters are involved in a wide range of processes relevant to sexual function. Dopamine plays a key role in motivation, reward, and motor control. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation and is known to delay ejaculation when increased. Norepinephrine affects arousal and muscle contractions, while acetylcholine is important for communication between nerves and muscles. Imbalances in these systems may help explain why some individuals experience rapid ejaculation and emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that premature ejaculation may be partly driven by a failure to balance sexual arousal and inhibitory control. This could result from dysregulation in the brain’s reward and emotional circuits, leading to faster ejaculation that is difficult to consciously control. Some scientists have proposed that premature ejaculation may resemble impulse control disorders, which share similar disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. Other studies have linked premature ejaculation to traits like anxiety, impaired self-regulation, and heightened sensitivity to sexual stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these insights, the study has some limitations. It was based on a relatively small sample and used a cross-sectional design, which means it cannot determine whether the brain differences cause the condition or are a result of it. The researchers also relied solely on functional imaging data, without combining it with structural scans or other biological measures. Future studies with larger and more diverse samples, as well as multimodal imaging approaches, may offer a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-024-00920-8" target="_blank"&gt;Abnormal percent amplitude of fluctuation in patients with lifelong premature ejaculation is associated with neurotransmitter profiles&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jiarui Yuan, Pinxiao Wang, Dingxin Nie, Wanxiang Zheng, Kepu Liu, Jianyong Feng, Yuntao Zhang, Yanzhu Wang, Junjun Gao, and Ming Gao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMUpXSTBCbURpd0pUREd1dVhwTFRHWURteThxeG9vZ01vR1V0cE1namFlck9UT3ZrQTFXRm5LY1d1RVlzVnh3RllyS211c2QySUxKU2t6dUdIZmNyNU1DNVZyUGk4NW9od1NwcGtmTFFDT0hXaTdkYTE1cHAySm9BRFhqU2lTcmZHR3RNODhtMkcyZUp3dVFHWmkyQUhFdkxreTlZU2V4b2szQjkzM0lhVXpNMnpXbE0</guid></item><item><title>分析智能手机应用程序数据的算法可以预测多发性硬化症症状-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | Algorithm to analyze smartphone app data can predict MS symptoms - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFZDdnlNSEdmTHlCaFVLT1hfVzlPR0FDZVVyM0ZKSEl0SHgtYzItZ21zRnhGR0RkM295a1hMZkp5Yi1manNERGVKU1BzT294TWFld0lvaXV1WTk1UHE2cTUtTUVxWmxVSzNsNDNBTmVhUW9rTjRhQmVMR0Z2U29jUUtxLVQtUDM4ZDVIaGhYRDZXNDl0WlM0WHFTSmNCMHhOMGIyQWlaeHpGTEhlNjVRSEZVdlJwUm5RdGRZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms to analyze data collected on a smartphone app could predict whether a person with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) will experience certain high-severity &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in the next three months, a study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe this will help empower patients to better understand their disease and work more easily with their healthcare team to make disease management decisions. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63888-x"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Performance of machine learning models for predicting high-severity symptoms in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system erroneously attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. Disease symptoms and severity can vary widely depending on which regions are most affected, and the extent of the damage. Typically, people with MS have clinical assessments a couple times a year, along with an annual &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scan&lt;/a&gt;, but these infrequent snapshots may not be enough to fully capture how it’s impacting their life between visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital monitoring tools like smartphone apps could fill this gap and enable collection of a wide range of data on a daily basis. In turn, AI algorithms can analyze the data and make predictions about disease progression to aid clinical decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mobile technology enables continual collection of data and can pave the path for predicting complex aspects of MS such as symptoms and disease courses,” the researchers wrote. “We might learn what symptoms MS subjects are likely to develop, why they are experiencing the ones they have, and what treatments are more suited for their current disease burden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Helping patients manage their disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An observational study called &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02845635"&gt;MS Mosaic (NCT02845635)&lt;/a&gt; was initiated to collect data from adults with MS in the U.S. via a mobile app over three years. The app was developed by scientists at Duke University in North Carolina and was made available for download during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants completed tasks that included demographic surveys, daily MS symptom reporting, and other active functional tests. The smartphone also passively collected data related to step counts, sleep, and heart rate. The researchers then partnered with Google data scientists to develop AI algorithms that would continuously predict when symptoms might occur. The analyses included data from 713 people who used the app for at least three months, most of whom had MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested several different approaches to predict on a weekly basis if a person would have any of five MS symptoms — &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/fatigue-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, sensory disturbances, walking instability, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-and-mental-health/"&gt;depression or anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and muscle cramps or spasms — with at least moderate severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team honed in on one type of algorithm that had the best predictive abilities, with a diagnostic accuracy between 80%-90% for each symptom. This model was particularly accurate considering all the evaluated features collected from the smartphone, but what seemed most important for predicting future symptoms was a past history of that symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that feature was removed from the algorithm, its predictive abilities declined, though it could still achieve a fairly high performance by looking at the totality of other data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of considering all available data collectively, which proves the need for methods that can analyze a wide range of data simultaneously,” wrote the researchers, noting an app-based method for predicting MS symptoms showed it could give patients more certainty in their daily lives. “Symptomatic uncertainties associated with MS can have a substantial impact on quality of life, as individuals struggle to anticipate how they will feel each day, whether their symptoms will impede daily tasks, or know if particular symptoms originate from their MS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By focusing on actionable prediction of high-severity symptoms, the algorithm described here could improve anticipatory guidance and symptom management,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a person knows their ability to walk might soon decline, they can consider &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/physiotherapy/"&gt;physical therapy&lt;/a&gt; or other interventions before this happens. The app was designed to provide patients with a symptom summary report that may facilitate such conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, “this approach has the potential to empower subjects as experts of their own experience in order to improve symptom management, and to optimize the often-limited interactions with physicians and clinical experts,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:01:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFZDdnlNSEdmTHlCaFVLT1hfVzlPR0FDZVVyM0ZKSEl0SHgtYzItZ21zRnhGR0RkM295a1hMZkp5Yi1manNERGVKU1BzT294TWFld0lvaXV1WTk1UHE2cTUtTUVxWmxVSzNsNDNBTmVhUW9rTjRhQmVMR0Z2U29jUUtxLVQtUDM4ZDVIaGhYRDZXNDl0WlM0WHFTSmNCMHhOMGIyQWlaeHpGTEhlNjVRSEZVdlJwUm5RdGRZ</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚在HIV治愈研究方面取得重大突破- Queerty | Scientists just made a major breakthrough in HIV cure research - Queerty</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOdHpqR0l2cE9MMUtGNUZuM01SOHd5N0JydDNMWDM5QkExZnNGcEdpSG5UdTlFUGFTVFF3aXZDb1BadlVURkw0NERld1JPM2pQYklCZEdNMWoxaGU0eXpqVzZmYkFHa28xREpjOGI1ZEVHNzJCM2ZfYW1VV0Y4VnVPaWtKcmhoZHhjeEd0QV9MWm4zWjczTTY3Qk0zcy0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cf-column"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Fudan University, the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Shaoxin Laboratory, all in China, has developed a retinal prosthesis woven from metal nanowires that partially restored vision in blind mice.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;In their paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu2987" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, the group describes how they created tellurium nanowires and interlaced them to create a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/retinal+prosthesis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal prosthesis&lt;/a&gt;. Eduardo Fernández, with University Miguel Hernández, in Spain, has published a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4439" target="_blank"&gt;Perspective&lt;/a&gt; piece in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a way to cure blindness has been a major goal for scientists for many years, and such efforts have paid off for some types of blindness, such as those caused by cataracts. Other types of blindness associated with damage to the retina, however, have proven too difficult to overcome in most cases. For this research, the team in China tried a new approach to treating such types of blindness by building a mesh out of a semiconductor and affixing it to the back of the eye, where it could send signals to the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/optic+nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;optic nerve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work involved fabricating nanowires out of tellurium and then interlacing them to form a mesh. Tellurium was chosen for the project because it can directly convert &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/light+energy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;light energy&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/electrical+energy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical energy&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/light+irradiation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;light irradiation&lt;/a&gt; without the need for an additional power supply. The electrical energy produced was then funneled to the optic nerve where it was processed by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing involved implanting the nanoprostheses in the eyes of mice with bioengineered &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/blindness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;. To test the effectiveness of the implants, the research team conducted imaging and electrophysiological recording of the nerves leading into the optic nerves and signals that were carried to the brain and found activity not present in a control group. They also found that the implants resulted in restored pupil reflexes along with neuron firing, which were also not present in a control group. The implanted mice were also able to turn toward an LED light and to respond to pattern testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosthesis also allowed for processing near-infrared light, which, the researchers suggest, could lead to the development of devices that could provide sharper color contrast and better night vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nucleus Genomics, a genetic testing startup founded by 25-year-old Kian Sadeghi, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/nucleus-genomics-lands-new-funding-from-alexis-ohanian-to-help-people-assess-specific-disease-risks/?guccounter=1"&gt;initially launched in 2021 &lt;/a&gt;with the goal of calculating a patient’s risk for specific diseases. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it’s been courting controversy for years with products that claim to tell people how their genetics correlate to a host of complex issues, including their IQ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, it ratcheted up the controversy to an earsplitting level when it announced a new product called Nucleus Embryo &lt;a href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics/status/1930293851383615752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that said: “Every parent wants to give their children more than they had. For the first time in human history, Nucleus adds a new tool to that commitment.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus says it can test IVF embryos not just for well-known specific genes that have a high chance of illnesses like breast cancer, but also for appearance — sex, height, hair color, eye color — as well as IQ and complex health attributes like anxiety and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch video includes a screenshot of a comparison menu. The idea is to help parents choose which embryos to pick and which ones to, perhaps, discard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Genetic testing of embryos isn’t unheard of. IVF physicians &lt;a href="https://www.froedtert.com/fertility/genetic-screening/pgd-chromosomal-abnormalities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;can test for&lt;/a&gt; genes that can cause conditions like Down syndrome, or when parents know they are of high risk for a particular genetic disorder, like cystic fibrosis. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that’s not exactly what Nucleus is doing. It is using controversial “polygenic scores” to determine “complex genetic outcomes, like intelligence and anxiety,” a spokesperson says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, polygenic scores only calculate the probabilities of a certain complex illness occurring, mainly within populations. “A polygenic risk score can only explain the relative risk for a disease,” &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;the NHGR says&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the same as discovering a specific gene, such as the BRCA1 gene mutation, which gives a person a 60% to 80% “absolute risk of breast cancer,” the NHGR says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a reason doctors don’t typically use such tests for individuals. “Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated,” according to the NHGR.  &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus defends that its method can be used to determine an individual’s risk. The spokesperson pointed us to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;a 2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; where the authors said they had developed validated methods for five common diseases: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That paper was advocating screenings to help individuals make lifestyle or therapeutic decisions, similar to Nucleus’s initial concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wednesday’s tweet was promising parents that Nucleus can help them create designer babies. It has now been viewed more than 4 million times and has hundreds of comments, many of them either expressing disbelief that this works as promised, or horror at the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://x.com/maxniederhofer/status/1930551749531574421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;VC chimed&lt;/a&gt; into the discussion saying, “I was going to type something like Noah get the boat but honestly the reality of this just makes me so nauseous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus has experienced this kind of controversy before, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/controversial-genetics-testing-startup-nucleus-genomics-raises-14m-series-a/"&gt;TechCrunch previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, when it announced its $14 million Series A earlier this year. The startup is backed by Founders Fund; Alexis Ohanian’s 776; &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/nucleus-genomics-lands-new-funding-from-alexis-ohanian-to-help-people-assess-specific-disease-risks/?guccounter=1"&gt;and angels, including&lt;/a&gt; Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), and Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, Sadeghi launched Nucleus IQ, which is supposed to tell users how much their genetics influence intelligence. The product was blasted &lt;a href="https://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/genetic-iq-tests#:~:text=On%20the%20ethical%20side%2C%20too,race%20as%20a%20biological%20category." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;as “bad science and big business”&lt;/a&gt; by some critics. Sadeghi &lt;a href="https://nucleusgenomics.substack.com/p/genetics-can-predict-height-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;published a lengthy defense &lt;/a&gt;of his company’s methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even so, telling adults that they are genetically smart is one thing. Telling IVF parents that they can choose the appearance and other complex attributes for their children is, &lt;a href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics/status/1930293851383615752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;many would argue&lt;/a&gt;, something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/embryo-ivf-screening-longevity-2b1f096a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;is not currently conducting such tests via IVF lab partners&lt;/a&gt; itself, The Wall Street Journal reports. It’s partnering with Genomic Prediction, which works with IVF clinics. A Genomic executive told the WSJ that many parents request intelligence tests, and it doesn’t provide that. Parents can voluntarily upload genetic data information to Nucleus if they want to pursue it. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, as Sadeghi said in the launch video aimed at would-be parents: “Not that long ago, IVF-1 sparked fear and the stigma of test tube babies,” he said. “What was once controversial is now an everyday practice. The same is true with genetic optimization. The technology is now here and it’s here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
