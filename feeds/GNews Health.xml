													644. IN TIME FOR NEWS TO GO, WE HAVE     A LOOK AT TODAY’S TOP NEWS STORIES ALONG WITH YOUR TRAFFIC AND WEATHER, ALL BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT THE DOOR. WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS OUT OF OCONEE COUNTY. ISABELLE MARKS AT THE OCONEE COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT CENTER. ISABELLE. WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR? HEY, ERIN, WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IS THAT OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING A HOMICIDE AFTER A WIFE AND HUSBAND WERE FOUND DEAD IN THEIR HOME OVERNIGHT. NOW, THERE’S LIMITED DETAILS SINCE THIS IS STILL PRETTY EARLY ON IN THE INVESTIGATION. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW SO FAR IS THAT THE COUNTY CORONER SAYS THAT THEY RECEIVED A CALL AROUND 9:00 LAST NIGHT AND REPORT THAT THE COUPLE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THEIR HOME ON CROMER MOOR DRIVE, NEAR WESTMINSTER. THE 911 CALL WAS PLACED BY A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS CHECKING IN AFTER NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM, AND THE CORONER’S OFFICE SAYS THE DEATHS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AS A HOMICIDE. THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 76 YEAR OLD LARRY MOORE AND HIS WIFE, 75 YEAR OLD SANDRA MOORE. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS RIGHT NOW. WE DON’T KNOW IF THERE’S A SUSPECT INVOLVED. WE ALSO DON’T KNOW THEIR CAUSE OF DEATH JUST YET. WE’LL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU UPDATED, BOTH ON AIR AND ONLINE, AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE, BUT FOR NOW, REPORTING LIVE IN OCONEE COUNTY. ISABELLE MARAK WYFF NEWS FOUR ISABELLE. THANK YOU. MORE BREAKING NEWS WE’RE FOLLOWING THIS MORNING. DEPUTIES IN GREENVILLE COUNTY ARE SEARCHING FOR A MAN THEY SAY ATTACKED A WOMAN. DEPUTIES SAY IT HAPPENED JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT NEAR WEST PARKER ROAD. DEPUTIES SAY THEY GOT A 911 CALL REGARDING AN ATTACK. AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SCENE, THEY LOCATED A WOMAN WITH SIGNIFICANT INJURIES. THEY DESCRIBED THE SUSPECTED ATTACKER AS A MAN WEARING CAMOUFLAGE PANTS AND A BLACK JACKET. INVESTIGATORS SAY THE VICTIM AND THE SUSPECT KNEW EACH OTHER AND THE ATTACK APPEARS ISOLATED. VICTORIA. ALL RIGHT. BUNDLE UP OUT THE DOOR THIS MORNING. IT’S DEFINITELY COLD. STARTING OFF IN SINGLE DIGITS IN THE 20S FOR WIND CHILLS ACROSS THE CAROLINAS. THEN AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, WE BEGIN TO WARM UP AND WE’LL SEE MORE SUNSHINE. ONCE AGAIN, A BREEZE COMES IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST LATER TODAY. THIS WILL BRING TEMPERATURES UP ABOVE FREEZING BY TOMORROW MORNING. FOR THE UPSTATE, WE’LL SEE A MIXTURE OF SNOW AND RAIN FOR THE MOUNTAINS EARLY ON SATURDAY, AS THIS COLD FRONT BLOWS IN. MAINLY JUST RAIN FOR THE UPSTATE BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ARE ABOVE FREEZING BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS, WE’LL CONTINUE TO SEE THAT MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW. AND THEN ONCE THAT COLD FRONT BLOWS THROUGH, WE LOSE THAT MOISTURE FOR SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES ACTUALLY WARM UP TOWARDS THE 50S FOR TOMORROW. IT WILL BE A NICE AFTERNOON OVERALL. AND THEN WE WATCH THAT COLD BLAST MOVE IN ON SUNDAY. AGAIN, WE’VE BEEN WATCHING THESE WEATHER MODELS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS FOR THAT POTENTIAL OF SNOW HERE IN THE UPSTATE, AND NOW IT IS BACKING OFF FOR LOCAL SNOW TOTALS OR SNOW CHANCES HERE FOR THE UPSTATE AND FOR NORTH CAROLINA. MOST MODELS NOW KEEP THIS COLD FRONT SOUTH OF THE MIDLANDS. NOW AGAIN, IT’S CLOUDY ENOUGH AND WE COULD SQUEEZE OUT A FEW FLURRIES THROUGH THE MORNING. AND THEN THAT SHOULD BE IT. ONCE THIS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH WE COULD SEE SNOW POTENTIAL MAINLY FOR THE COAST. AND THEN BEHIND THAT. SUNSHINE RETURNS MONDAY WITH SOME PRETTY COLD WEATHER. AARON VICTORIA ANOTHER LOOK AT TRAFFIC AT 6.47. BUT FIRST, THE SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IS PREPARING ROADS ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW AND ICE THIS WEEKEND. SCDOT HAS TWO SALT DOMES IN THE STATE AND ONE IN THE UPSTATE HAS MORE THAN 10,000 TONS OF SALT. IT’S USED TO PREPARE THE ROADS FOR SNOWY WEATHER CONDITIONS. SCDOT SAYS IT WILL PRIORITIZE HEAVILY TRAVELED ROADS BEFORE MAKING THEIR WAY TO SECONDARY ROADS. WE’VE BEEN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON OUR ROADS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. WE’RE NOW LOOKING AT 85. THIS IS RIGHT AT THAT 26 INTERCHANGE, SPECIFICALLY 85 SOUTH AT I-26 IN SPARTANBURG COUNTY. NO ISSUES THERE. I DO WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION, THOUGH. THERE IS A CRASH AT EXIT ONE IN LANDRUM ON 26 WESTBOUND. SO IF YOU’RE HEADED TO LANDRUM, MAYBE YOU’RE CROSSING THE STATE LINE GOING INTO NORTH CAROLINA. WE’RE SEEING A LITTLE BACKUP THERE. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE’S NOT A CAMERA RIGHT THERE, BUT I’D ESTIMATE THAT BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT A HALF A MILE RIGHT THERE. TRAVEL TIMES OVERALL LOOK GOOD THOUGH. 26 EASTBOUND IS 11 MINUTES FROM I-240 TO ASHEVILLE. HIGHWAY 85 SOUTHBOUND FROM AIRPORT WOODRUFF ROAD TO SIX MINUTES AND 35 NORTHBOUND FROM FAIRVIEW ROAD TO DOWNTOWN. 14 MINUTES. TRI-COUNTY TECHNICAL COLLEGE IS EXPANDING. THE COLLEGE IS BREAKING GROUND TODAY ON A $31 MILLION INVESTMENT IN ITS ANDERSON CAMPUS, WITH THE GOAL TO EXPAND AND GROW ITS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THE EXPANSION WILL CREATE A MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS HUB TO HOUSE EIGHT PROGRAMS ON A SINGLE CAMPUS. THE CONSTRUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE DONE BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR, AND THE GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY SET FOR 11:00 THIS MORNING WITH DINNER PLANS HAVE BEEN A STRUGGLE.

Of those infected, here is the vaccination status: 483 unvaccinated, 6 partially vaccinated with one of the recommended two-dose MMR sequence, 13 vaccinated, and 56 unknown. The incubation period for measles is usually 7 to 14 days but can be up to 21 days. People should monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Symptoms of measles include cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and fever followed by a rash two to three days later that starts on the face then spreads to the rest of the body.  The MMR vaccine is safe and is the best way to protect against the virus.  Vaccination now can avoid long quarantines at home for those exposed to the measles virus. Vaccination within 72 hours of exposure can prevent measles infections. Vaccines are available at many primary care provider offices and pharmacies, as well as DPH Health Departments.

Fifteen more children died from the flu in the week ending Jan. 10, bringing the total of pediatric deaths to 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2a277" class="body-graf"&gt;On Friday, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an over 18% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2026-week-01.html" target="_blank"&gt;drop in confirmed flu cases&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the previous week. Doctor visits for respiratory illnesses also decreased by more than 5% and hospitalization rates went down by nearly 55%. Influenza deaths rose by 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b30313" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC estimates that so far this season, 18 million people have had the flu, including 230,000 who were hospitalized and 9,300 who have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4f576" class="body-graf"&gt;“It seems like there is some cautious good news that cases are declining,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island. “But I’m going to put a giant asterisk on this because that does not mean the worst is behind us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edf672" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, flu cases dipped around this time before hitting a second peak in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-cases-high-cdc-illness-hospitalizations-rcna191203" target="_blank"&gt;early February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08a22c" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC data also captures the national trend, and it's likely some states have not yet seen influenza cases peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-806e73" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are not going to all experience this at the same time,” said Beth Carlton, a professor of public health at the Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado in Aurora. “Nationwide, the trend is going down, but there may be differences in different states and communities as this virus runs its course.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3996e8" class="body-graf"&gt;While influenza tends to show up first in highly populated areas, such as New York City, and then hit rural areas later in the season, “the challenge with flu is that it is incredibly nimble, so it does not always behave the way we expect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d7d24" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases may be dipping, but flu and other winter illnesses including norovirus, Covid and strep throat are closing schools in states around the country, including in &lt;a href="https://www.kark.com/news/state-news/flu-outbreak-causes-arkansas-school-district-to-shut-down-for-two-days/" target="_blank"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas, &lt;a href="https://www.lex18.com/news/covering-kentucky/robertson-county-schools-closes-through-friday-due-to-flu-strep-throat-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, Tennessee and West Virginia, where overall cases are reported to be low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-395355" class="body-graf"&gt;Idaho, New Mexico, New York and parts of Appalachia are still experiencing very high levels of flu, while the number of reported cases is low in Montana, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbb335" class="body-graf"&gt;“The amount of people hospitalized for influenza around New Year’s was really high, the second highest in the past 10 years, with last year being the highest,” Carlton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d69a7" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-2026-states-deaths-cdc-symptoms-superflu-rcna251910" target="_blank"&gt;notably bad&lt;/a&gt; flu season this year is driven by a highly mutated strain of influenza A called H3N2 subclade K, which has key mutations that make it less similar to the strain used in this year’s flu vaccine. Influenza-like illnesses, which include other flu-like viruses including RSV and Covid, are also very high this year, Nuzzo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bfbb5" class="body-graf"&gt;Usually these viruses surge in the same season, “but they are fortunately often staggered,” she said, noting that this year the viruses appear to be peaking around the same time, making this year’s cold and flu season particularly brutal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f34ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts had worried earlier that the flu vaccine wouldn’t be a good match against the subclade K. Recent research found that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-vaccine-2026-effective-symptoms-new-research-rcna252659" target="_blank"&gt;current flu vaccine is effective against the variant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd3156" class="body-graf"&gt;The current flu shot protects against three strains: two A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-132fcb" class="body-graf"&gt;“With this K clade, we can still say the flu vaccine is helpful, especially for keeping you out of the hospital,” Nuzzo said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-382366" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year was the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm#:~:text=Since%20that%20time%2C%20the%20highest%20number%20of,(210)%20was%20reported%20during%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20season." target="_blank"&gt;deadliest&lt;/a&gt; flu season for kids since the CDC began tracking pediatric deaths.

Our boys were ages 2 and 5 at the time. Despite being a cheating asshole, Peter did remain a devoted father, and I swallowed my animosity toward him for the sake of parenting the kids effectively after the divorce. But now something terrible has happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;

The boys are devastated, but if I’m being honest, I’m secretly pleased the bastard is gone. The kids, however, are confused about why I’m not saddened by his loss. How am I supposed to handle this? It feels so disingenuous to try putting on an act of grief over the death of the scumbag.&lt;/p&gt;

Tell them that you are sad for their loss and that you hate the fact that someone who meant so much to them is no longer here. Explain that their emotions are the ones that matter most right now; if you need to offer more that, you can share that you grieved your relationship with your ex long ago and that his place in your life was based on who he was to them. Encourage them to share how they are processing the loss and be vocal about your empathy: “I’m so sorry this happened,” “I know how hard this must be for you.” I’m sure you do feel bad for your children, even if you don’t feel bad about your ex. Lean into your concern for them and away from your feelings of victory, no matter how well earned.&lt;/p&gt;

He will ask for snacks, and when we say no, he will have a temper tantrum. We won’t let him have anything else but won’t force him to eat dinner. If he asks for food later, he can eat what was made for dinner or have a glass of milk. For a while he would ask for food after his bath, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/10/parenting-advice-bad-words-books.html"&gt;but now he just won’t eat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A 20-year-old man’s switch to the keto diet dramatically changed his body—just not in the way anyone would have expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors writing in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/image-challenge?ci=20260115"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; how the man developed a rare skin condition often caused by switching to keto, one that covered his neck and chest in itchy rashes. Despite the alarming symptoms, the condition is readily treatable, provided the person can be convinced to stop their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Keto rash&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This latest case was presented as a part of a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/image-challenge"&gt;regular segment&lt;/a&gt; in the NEJM detailing unusual or noteworthy medical images.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the otherwise healthy man visited a dermatology clinic four weeks after developing a peculiar rash. He told doctors that two months earlier, he had started a keto diet for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The skin condition is formally called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/keto-rash"&gt;prurigo pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s better known by its nickname, “keto rash.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t really sure why the condition occurs, but it’s strongly linked to someone entering ketosis, a metabolic state in which the body breaks down stored fat as its primary source of energy instead of glucose. Keto diets induce ketosis by heavily limiting carbohydrate-rich foods, though other health conditions can trigger it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rash develops across several phases. It usually begins as small, itchy red or purple bumps along the neck, chest, and back. These bumps then enlarge and form a distinctive net-like (reticular) pattern on the skin; they can sometimes fill with fluid and crust over, similar to blisters. The bumps may become less itchy and fade over time but can recur repeatedly, eventually leaving behind persistent darkened (hyperpigmented) spots.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Rare and resolvable&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this said, keto rash remains an incredibly rare complication of ketosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(19)32142-5/abstract"&gt;2019 paper&lt;/a&gt;, only around 300 cases had been documented worldwide at the time, including just 20 cases in the U.S. The condition has been most commonly reported among women of East Asian ancestry, particularly in Japan, but not exclusively, as with this latest report.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Rare as the rash is, its incidence could be rising with the increased popularity of keto diets. And because it’s seldom seen, doctors may mistake the rash for more common skin conditions like eczema. Once identified, however, it can be easily treated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rash eventually goes away once a person leaves ketosis, though it might take a few weeks to clear. For most cases, that means ending the keto diet (cases not linked to a keto diet tend to go away on their own). Tetracycline antibiotics are commonly used to manage its symptoms, since they have anti-inflammatory effects. As for our protagonist, the report authors didn’t detail whether the man took their advice and ditched the keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Strange rashes aren’t the only weird side effect of trendy diets. Last January, doctors &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-florida-mans-meat-cheese-and-butter-diet-caused-his-hands-to-seep-out-cholesterol-2000554027"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how a man’s high-fat “carnivore” diet full of cheese, butter, and meat caused his hands to literally seep out cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

The incident, however, would save the infant's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jewel Hee was busy doing laundry in September 2024 when she caught her three-year-old daughter, Harper, trying to pick up four-month-old baby Hazel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 27-year-old raced over, but not before Harper accidentally dropped the baby from about a foot off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Terrified that Hazel may have been seriously injured, the mother-of-two rushed her straight to the hospital, where a full-body X-ray revealed she hadn't broken any bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until they were about to leave that a nurse discovered Hazel's oxygen levels were extremely low, which can eventually lead to brain death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believed the infant may have had a lung infection and prescribed antibiotics, but her health continued to decline over the next several months.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, in May 2025, an MRI scan revealed Hazel had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15181605/habits-deadly-stroke-sleep-processed-food-hypertension.html"&gt;suffered a stroke&lt;/a&gt; during pregnancy, which Hee says would have gone undetected had she not initially rushed her daughter to the hospital for a freak accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hee said: 'My daughter saved Hazel's life. All of our family and friends consider Harper to be Hazel's hero. It was a happy accident in the end. It was divine intervention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jewel Hee was terrified when her toddler, Harper (left), accidentally dropped her younger sister, Hazel (right). However, doctors believe it actually saved her life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the stroke was due to a blood clot in Hee's placenta, a temporary organ that grows during pregnancy to provide nutrients to a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were completely dumbfounded,' Hee said. 'We were expecting to leave and they told us everything was great. We were shocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought, "Why wasn't this found beforehand?" She'd had four months of screening with doctors and she's had all her vitals done before.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was very upset at first [after finding out about the stroke]. You're telling me my child had a stroke while I was pregnant with her and not a single doctor was able to catch that?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A perinatal stroke, or a stroke that occurs in the womb, cuts off blood supply to a fetus' brain, which may later lead to developmental delays and feeding issues. It affects between one in 1,000 and one in 3,000 newborns in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hazel had trouble breastfeeding and would aspirate milk into her lungs rather than her stomach, which had triggered her low oxygen levels. She had also been born at a low weight and had reduced muscle tone, leading to movement difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hee said: '[Previously] the doctors weren't concerned so I wasn't concerned. Usually when you have really low oxygen your lips will turn blue and you have a harder time staying awake, but she had none of those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor had told us that if we had not found this as soon as we did and she had gone through flu season without understanding what had been going on, we would have lost her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hazel is pictured at left and right in the hospital. The stroke she suffered in the womb has left her with developmental delays as well as oxygen and feeding issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hee said she is grateful that Harper (left) inadvertently saved her sister's (right) life, as doctors believe she would not have otherwise survived&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hazel now receives oxygen therapy, suffers from developmental delays, wears braces on her feet to help her strength and uses a feeding tube as a result of the stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Hee is 'grateful' that Harper saved Hazel's life, she urges parents to seek medical care immediately if anything seems off and is pushing for more thorough screening from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I am eternally grateful. I thank God every day that everything happened that did and we were able to find out early. If they would have caught it earlier she would not need to have as nearly as many interventions as she does now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's absolutely terrifying to think that something that could have been prevented, or at least caught as early as it supposedly happened so that she didn't have as many issues as now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to raise awareness for other people to make sure they ask questions they need to at a routine appointment and that they push for more through screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they see anything wrong with their child, don't hesitate to bring them in or get them checked out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:15:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQRzJnaUZNRlJBeFNrcy1jXy04aTNTYUVJX2w5OEdlV21aSTJmTlI4QnJLd3hIb2ZTX2pIYmpWZFVMa0tVY1lTbFVyaDdyS1VsNzM2MG5TUWdhV3ZjQWpnODA3MzdaVnBQUGlpU3NKZGptc3pwTmtSRGxKSHNtbURqMTVTdTk1RENnVXNKMVFXUVZPZzIxQ3l4ODdOSktLcno3RDhYNDVB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE41dHFLQmc5eXAzT1Y5b0l4eG9CLXJwWW5HZW1vN0tKMTJNWlhTSlBXUHM0ZzdFbUdzbjJxTDlST0l2NDJLWE9hYkVUQTV5Tmhick9ubUlycjBuYlRBS3hOVzdFUzBEc3VRWFZFbkQyOXVyNkFJSDdDdW10ajFkNkYtUEFERXBFYnVkYkRVOER5Y0VzZ1F5S0pfNzd2OUI1T0p4S0NlVzVpcG80aw</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府在被红手抓住后取消了怪诞不道德的医学研究-未来主义</title><link>https://futurism.com/health-medicine/trump-rfk-africa-vaccines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="article-featured-image-figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;What do you get when you put a vaccine conspiracy theorist in charge of the agency responsible for funding medical research throughout the globe? A recipe for Tuskegee 2.0, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Some bombshell reporting over the last month has revealed a monstrous plan by Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services to fund a $1.6 million study on hepatitis B vaccines among 14,000 newborns in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. As protocol documents &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-leaked-protocol-of-the" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show, the study would have been a “randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of neonatal Hepatitis B vaccination on early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In other words, the study aims to withheld Hep B vaccinations from 7,000 infants in one of the poorest countries on earth — so that western researchers could compare their long-term health to babies that got the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;This is where things get hazy. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the trial — slated to begin in 2027 — had been halted by officials in Guinea-Bissau, after &lt;a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/media/press-releases/lofgren-slams-rfk-jr-disgraceful-plan-fund-unethical-research-infants-guinea" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;weeks of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;outrage&lt;/a&gt; from health officials and researchers. Instead, the Africa CDC told the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; the study would be reworked to address the ethics concerns that have become a rallying cry in the medical research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The study has been cancelled,” Africa CDC official Yap Boum said on Thursday, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But a spokesperson for the HHS pushed back strongly, saying the study was forging ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” HHS assistant secretary for public affairs told us in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts,” he said. “This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of HBV0.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;We’ve reached out to the HHS and the Africa CDC to try to figure out what’s going on, since the two groups seem to be disagreeing on details as basic as whether the study is still happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Regardless, experts are appalled at the implications of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This is another Tuskegee,” one anonymous CDC official told &lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;They were refering to the &lt;a href="https://arkansasworker.com/racism-imperialism-and-medical-practices-the-tuskegee-and-guatemalan-syphilis-studies/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous experiment that ran from 1932 until 1972 in which 600 poor Black men with syphilis were studied to understand the long-term effects of the disease in exchange for “free medical care” from the US government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The catch? Though penicillin was discovered to be an &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/syphilis-its-early-history-and-treatment-until-penicillin-and-the-debate-on-its-origins/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;effective treatment for syphilis&lt;/a&gt; mid-way through the study in 1943, study subjects were never offered the antibiotic, or even told they had syphilis in the first place — leaving them to suffer the full effects of the debilitating infection, even though it was entirely treatable. It remains one of the most barbaric biomedical research studies in US history, and its cruelty is &lt;a href="https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/news/researchers-and-students-run-pilot-project-oakland-test-whether-tuskegee-syphilis-trial-last" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;still felt to this day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Continuing, the CDC official told &lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine &lt;/em&gt;that “we are allowing children, infants, to be exposed to Hepatitis B when we could prevent it, and then follow them for five years to see what happens. That’s not long enough to see the long-term benefits, but might be long enough to find some non-specific effects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Non-specific effects” is a key buzzword swirling around Kennedy’s orbit of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/beauty/the-wellness-world-elites-in-rfk-jrs-orbit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;holistic wellness influences&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially means “unintended harms.” The HHS’s chosen researchers for the Guinea-Bissau study were Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, a controversial Danish couple who have spent years chasing after &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/randomized-trials-show-no-evidence-of-non-specific-vaccine-effects" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;non-specific effects&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Thankfully, “the good guys won,” as Paul Offit, an infectious disease physician told the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable… We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the HHS is denying the study is canceled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Children receiving the MMR shot only increased by about 10% compared to that time the previous year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Andrea Romero, immunization program section manager at NMDOH, told ABC News communication was key during the outbreak. Romero said most of the adults who got vaccinated did so because they were unsure of their vaccination status and felt a strong sense of duty to get the shot, not just to protect themselves but to protect their community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"When they know that they're making a difference, it matters," Romero said. "Every time I take that opportunity [to say], 'Thank you for being a great community and your response, caring about yourself, your family, your neighbor,' but it means a lot because it's their efforts. It was their response that made the difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;NMDOH data shared with ABC News shows that 384 children with a vaccine exemption on file received at least one MMR shot between Jan. 13, 2025 and Jan. 13, 2026. This suggests parents of these children changed their minds about the vaccine around the time of New Mexico’s measles outbreak, according to health department officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;During that same timeframe, at least one MMR dose was the only immunization on record for 189 children in the state, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Fears of further measles spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors near outbreak regions are also experiencing the effects of fears and questions about measles and vaccination from their community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Deborah Greenhouse, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics and pediatrician in South Carolina, told ABC News that her community hasn't had a measles case yet, but parents and healthcare providers are increasingly concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"As we all know, and as my patients know, measles virus does not respect county borders, so, as the numbers continue to rise, the likelihood that we start seeing cases here in the midlands of South Carolina increases dramatically," Greenhouse said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;On Tuesday, health officials announced there was a measles exposure on Jan. 2 in the midlands region at the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If more families decline the vaccines, our vaccination rates drop and we become an open target, essentially a sitting duck for an outbreak, much like the Spartanburg area," Greenhouse said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;One year-old River Jacobs is held by his mother, Caitlin Fuller, while he receives an MMR vaccine from Raynard Covarrubio, at a vaccine clinic put on by Lubbock Public Health Department, March 1, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In her experience, building a foundation of trust has been essential for vaccine acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"They know me, they trust me," Greenhouse said.

Why? Because accomplishing something with a degree of struggle is the way to realize joy. I gave the example of using GLP-1 drugs for weight loss as a bad resolution. Don’t get me wrong: These medications are a miracle, transformative for many people. But they take out the struggle—which is the point of making a resolution in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The column provoked quite a few comments. For example. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your resolution to do more things you enjoy: listen to and do what Mrs. B says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amen to that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the responses also inspired for me another question: New Year’s resolutions aside, how much happiness do GLP-1s stimulate? And what about other relatively struggle-free ways to change your appearance, from plastic surgery to hair implants? Let’s have a look at the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. GLP-1 Drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who use this medication make the assumption that it will raise their well-being, at least in an indirect way, because they will look better or see health improvements. That’s a big assumption—and, as yet, it’s without much research to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial studies are somewhat mixed. Most research to date does suggest some positive well-being results from GLP-1 drugs, such as one review of Mendelian randomization studies (a statistical technique that allows researchers to establish causality without treatment-control experiments). They &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.25322150v1" rel&gt;show that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, on average, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.25322150v1" rel&gt;depression falls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; after people start the drugs, and their sense of well-being rises even beyond what the weight loss and health improvements would predict. In some rodent studies, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453015300184?via%3Dihub" rel&gt;researchers find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the drugs have antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects in the long term—though I question how one can tell when a rat is feeling depressed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, we find some conflicting evidence. One large 2024 study in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75965-2" rel&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; GLP-1 drugs led some patients to develop psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, even suicidal behaviors. (For patients who already struggle with these maladies, GLP-1 drugs appear to increase their mental suffering.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the jury’s still out—and people using these drugs need to pay close attention to their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Plastic Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a general rule, cosmetic surgery has been found to raise well-being, at least in the beginning. The data on well-being &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dmlsjournal.com/index.php/January2024/article/view/73" rel&gt;reveal that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; people see the highest self-rated quality-of-life increases from breast augmentation, followed by rhinoplasty, liposuction, Botox, and dermal fillers. Breast augmentation improved well-being among the women who sought it for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/abstract/1994/12000/the_efficacy_of_breast_augmentation__breast_size.9.aspx" rel&gt; two reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: lower self-consciousness and high self-confidence. However, longer-term studies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33854453/" rel&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the effects diminish over time, with 12 percent lower psychological well-being after three years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Anabolic Steroids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas most cosmetic surgery involves women, steroid use and testosterone supplementation are predominantly a male phenomenon. The research on this reveals two main patterns of outcome. First, hormone replacement under a physician’s direction (elevating unusually low testosterone) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/andr.12867?utm_source=consensus" rel&gt;improves quality of life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, by lowering depressive symptoms and raising energy levels. But steroid use (prescribed by the dude who hangs out over by the squat rack) to raise sex hormones to supraphysiological levels &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/036354659202000613" rel&gt;increases aggression and irritability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, popularly known as “roid rage.” Elevated levels of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07853890.2024.2337717?needAccess=true&amp;amp;utm_source=consensus" rel&gt; depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also tend to occur, despite the drugs’ clear success for their intended purpose (muscle strength and size).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, the findings would appear to support the common contention that women’s typical cosmetic alterations raise well-being more than men’s ones do. This is consistent with the research on evolutionary psychology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-018-9717-z" rel&gt;suggesting that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; aesthetic appearance is more important for female happiness, on average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve written about all of these changes at a certain scholarly remove. None of them has been a part of my life. But the next one hits me more directly. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Hair Transplants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m going to let you in on a secret from the Sacred Brotherhood of Bald Men: If we see a man our age with a full head of hair sent to jail for embezzlement, that feels cosmically just to us. We fight this schadenfreude internally and deny it to others, but it’s there—I’m sorry. Before you judge me too harshly, consider the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40990054/" rel&gt;words of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; scholars writing in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;: “Hair loss is associated with significant psychological distress and may exacerbate depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the answer? For some, hair transplants “can lead to improved self-esteem, confidence, and emotional well-being.” But not always. The scholars also note that for some men, mental health actually worsens after treatment. This certainly appears to be the case for men suffering from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jocd.70475?utm_source=consensus" rel&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a malady that might also account for some of the steroid use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So there you have it, the happiness evidence on a few of the most popular body-aesthetic interventions. Nothing I’ve written here should be interpreted as a condemnation of these choices. I don’t judge, as I hope not to be judged. But I’d like to make one other point in closing. Whatever you do to your appearance—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;even adding hair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;[sob]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;—will not make you love yourself, if you don’t already do so. That requires work you do on the inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cue Ball&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pursuit of Happiness with Arthur Brooks will be back next week with a column on Monday.

    &lt;p&gt;After a sharp &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html"&gt;uptick in flu cases in mid-December 2025&lt;/a&gt;, flu activity across the U.S. and Canada remains high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although cases are &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/respiratory-virus-surveillance/influenza.html"&gt;trending downward in Canada&lt;/a&gt; as of Jan. 9, 2026, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;the season has yet to peak in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://physicians.umassmemorial.org/details/4677/zachary-binder-emergency_medicine-pediatric_specialty_services-pediatrics_-_general_pediatrics-worcester"&gt;emergency room pediatrician&lt;/a&gt; in central Massachusetts, I’m seeing a tremendous amount of flu over the past few weeks. I’m hearing from colleagues in emergency rooms across the country that they are experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/new-flu-strain-2025-symptoms-rcna243681"&gt;similar explosion of flu cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early January, New York state recorded the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2026/2026-01-02_flu_hospitalizations.htm"&gt;highest number of flu cases in a single week&lt;/a&gt; on record. Several other states, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colorado-ranks-among-the-highest-states-in-the-country-for-flu-an-emergency-room-physician-describes-why-the-2025-26-flu-season-is-hitting-hard-273069"&gt;such as Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, are also experiencing record flu levels, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;44 out of 55 states and other jurisdictions&lt;/a&gt; are reporting high or very high flu activity, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spike in flu cases – widely referred to in &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/superflu-or-same-old-flu-how-subclade-k-influenza-playing-out-worldwide"&gt;media reports as a “superflu”&lt;/a&gt; – is largely driven by a newly identified subtype of the virus called subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s different about the current flu season?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu seasons vary every year. In 2024-2025, influenza cases rose fast beginning in October 2024. In contrast, the 2025-2026 season started out slow, but then it’s as if a switch was flipped in early to mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last week of December, throughout the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;over 8% of doctors visits were for flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt; – the &lt;a href="https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/p/updated-flu-report-national-edition"&gt;highest weekly rate since 2005&lt;/a&gt;. Emergency department visit rates for flu are spiking throughout the country, &lt;a href="https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/p/updated-flu-report-national-edition"&gt;most notably in the South and Northeast&lt;/a&gt;, where rates exceeded the national average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over this same time period, &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/respiratory-virus-surveillance/influenza.html"&gt;more than 26% of flu tests taken throughout Canada&lt;/a&gt; were positive for influenza. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Jan. 15, the CDC estimates that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;flu has caused 15 million illnesses&lt;/a&gt;, 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths this season. One small saving grace is that the flu this season hasn’t come on &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/rsv-flu-and-covid-demystifying-the-triple-epidemic-of-respiratory-viruses-220980"&gt;concurrently with either a respiratory syncytial virus – RSV – or COVID-19 surge&lt;/a&gt;, as it often does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nT414phB-Wc?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Public health experts expect flu rates to remain high for several more weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the flu is most dangerous for &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-diseases/flu-and-older-adults/"&gt;people over 65&lt;/a&gt; or those with underlying health conditions, with young children experiencing more mild symptoms. But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;this year’s strain is hitting kids harder&lt;/a&gt;. They are arriving in the emergency room after having had a high fever of more than 104 degrees for 5-7 days, or with flu complications including febrile seizures, croup or severe dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;especially high number of children&lt;/a&gt; is currently being hospitalized for flu, the CDC reports. As of Jan. 9, the U.S. had seen &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;17 deaths of children due to flu&lt;/a&gt; so far during the 2025-2026 season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024-2025, the deadliest year on record for kids, flu caused &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html"&gt;289 pediatric deaths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is subclade K?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, the subvariants of the influenza virus that are the most pervasive change slightly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the most prevalent variant is subclade K, which is a subtype of influenza H3N2. Subclade K was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.49.2500894"&gt;first detected in Australia in July 2025&lt;/a&gt;. It’s driving 91.5% of infections in the U.S. so far this season and is &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-jan9-canada-9.7039817"&gt;also responsible for the peak in Canada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subclade K has proved itself to be a particularly infectious variant, based on how quickly the volume of flu cases has surged. Its dominance may be driven by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586"&gt;mutations that make it different&lt;/a&gt; from previous strains. Some scientists speculate that H3 influenza viruses have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00061-6"&gt;circulated at relatively low levels the past few years&lt;/a&gt;, which may have led to lower levels of immunity in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my emergency department, we’re also seeing particularly high spiking fevers of 104 or 105 degrees, compared with more usual lower grade fevers. That in itself is not dangerous, but for young children it does result in more instances of febrile seizures and dehydration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/712784/original/file-20260115-56-8sgkkl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Children are currently being hospitalized for flu at an especially high rate.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/sick-child-on-a-receiving-a-saline-solution-in-royalty-free-image/1040812646"&gt;picture/iStock via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How late is too late to get vaccinated?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I recommend people get the flu shot, in line with &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/influenza/"&gt;guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. Getting vaccinated for the flu has proved to decrease the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000"&gt;serious illness, hospitalization and death&lt;/a&gt;. People who get the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.004"&gt;more likely to have milder cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people still considering getting the flu shot for this season, I strongly recommend doing so sooner rather than later. Waiting longer would limit the window in which the vaccine is most effective. That’s because it &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/timing-your-flu-shot-science-behind-when-get-vaccinated"&gt;takes a couple of weeks for the flu shot&lt;/a&gt; to impart its maximal benefits. Vaccination in mid-January would mean peak protection in late January and early February. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu season generally &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season.html"&gt;peaks in December through February&lt;/a&gt; in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note, however, is that the strains that were chosen to be included in the 2025-2026 flu vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;weren’t a great match for the predominantly circulating subclave K&lt;/a&gt;. Still, evidence suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/early-estimates-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-effectiveness-against-influenza-requiring"&gt;this year’s vaccine&lt;/a&gt; does &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.01.05.26343449"&gt;provide protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Should you take an at-home flu test?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, in most cases home testing for flu is not especially useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people seek out flu tests to determine whether they should get &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/flu-antivirals-what-to-know-and-when"&gt;antiviral therapies like Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;. But while those therapies might decrease your symptoms slightly, they aren’t particularly effective, and &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/influenza-flu-treatment/"&gt;they come with their own risks&lt;/a&gt;, such as upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea. Most of my colleagues in the emergency department, myself included, rarely recommend them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you have the flu or a flu-like illness such as RSV, COVID-19 or rhinovirus, the recommendations for treating and managing the illness at home as well as the point at which I’d suggest someone seek care are no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, being able to put a label on the disease isn’t all that important. With the high levels of flu circulating now, if you’re feeling unwell and have signs of fever and upper respiratory symptoms, you can almost assume it’s the flu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One exception is for people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease or severe asthma. For them, as for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/antiviral-drugs.html"&gt;people who are hospitalized for flu&lt;/a&gt;, antiviral therapy may be recommended and thus testing for the flu can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Basic precautions can protect you and your community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same precautions apply for all flu-like illnesses, but it’s worth being particularly mindful of just how contagious subclade K seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to protect yourself and your community. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-washing-your-hands-well-is-so-important-to-protect-your-family-from-the-flu-105348"&gt;Washing your hands frequently&lt;/a&gt; can minimize exposure to flu-containing droplets. Even more importantly, people who feel unwell – particularly if they have a fever – should stay home from work, school or activities, if possible, until they are fever-free for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Flu vaccine recommendations for children &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; in early January to “shared clinical decision-making”, which has typically meant a provider recommends the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked whether the new restrictions would lead to fewer children getting vaccinated against the flu, “maybe that’s a better thing”, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime vaccine critic, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-says-it-may-be-better-if-fewer-children-receive-the-flu-vaccine/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS News last week. “There is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalizations or death in children,” Kennedy claimed, despite extensive studies, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/risk-groups/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), showing the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072184/206063/Influenza-Vaccine-Effectiveness-Among-Children?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10979318/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828501" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His comments come after Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, cast doubt on how well flu vaccines work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every year, there’s a flu vaccine. It doesn’t always work very well. That’s why it’s been controversial of late,” Oz &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=738968345466786" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Newsmax. He instead recommended that Americans “take care” of themselves, so they can “overwhelm” the flu when they encounter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CDC press statements have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661508/flu-cdc-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one”, urging people to consult with their doctors to understand “the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines”. Unlike in previous years, there have been no health advisory notices from the CDC on the new variant, top health officials haven’t publicly received vaccines and a successful campaign called “Wild to Mild” was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/pediatricians-vaccines-flu-season" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;halted and not resumed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The dominant flu strain in the US is H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness, and this particular variant, subclade K, has mutated to get around immune defenses, which means more people may be susceptible to the flu than usual. The last time H3N2 spread through the US, in &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm#:~:text=Influenza%20(Flu)-,Estimated%20Flu%2DRelated%20Illnesses%2C%20Medical%20Visits%2C%20Hospitalizations%2C%20and,On%20This%20Page" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2017-18&lt;/a&gt;, about 51,000 people died, making it the most severe flu season in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far this year, there have been about 15m illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths from the flu, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; in its weekly update on 9 January – with deaths including at least 17 children . “There is still time to get vaccinated against flu this season,” the CDC concluded in the report, in sharp relief to public statements by health officials and new restrictions on the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an earlier CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, about 8.2% of visits to the doctor were for flu-like respiratory illnesses – the highest rate for this point in the season since the 1997-98 season. That rate fell slightly to 7.2% last week, but the CDC cautioned that the drop could be due to delays in reporting or seeking care because of the holidays. Some health systems are requiring providers to wear face masks amid &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/flu-season-ramps-nationwide-record-high-outpatient-illnesses-increasing-hospitalizations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;surging cases&lt;/a&gt;. New York, for instance, logged the most hospitalizations it has ever seen in the week ending 27 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The flu can be extremely, extremely severe. It can be really scary,” said Megan Berman, professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and faculty with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Berman has seen an influx of patients who need to be hospitalized, and “what they all had in common is actually they had not been vaccinated”. Even patients who have already gotten cases of flu A would still benefit from vaccines, she said, because there was often a double peak in flu season with flu B, which the vaccine also protects against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the UK, where flu season started early and now seems to be abating, shows that the vaccine is still effective at preventing hospitalizations: 70-75% effective in children and 30-40% effective in adults, a rate similar to previous flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the flu shot may not stop transmission, it is still very effective at preventing severe illness, Lakdawala said. But only 42.5% of children and 43.5% of adults have received the shot this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC. Vaccination rates have fallen in recent years after reaching a high of 63.7% of children and 48.4% of adults in 2019-20 – &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/vaccination-2019-2020.html#:~:text=Vaccination%20coverage%20with%20%E2%89%A51,in%20flu%20vaccination%20coverage%20persisted." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of the US population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Covid rates are also high, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasing, putting more pressure on hospitals. Both of those childhood shots also saw &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/11/rsv-vaccines-trump-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent restrictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The changes in the recommendations will probably further dampen vaccination rates because it “gives the message that it’s not important”, Berman said. Yet “nothing has changed from the science, and I know that physicians are still strongly recommending it to everyone six months and older … &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/children" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt; should not be dying from a preventable illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Antiviral treatments for flu have also fallen in recent years. About 79% of hospitalized flu patients in 2022-23 received antivirals, compared with 90% in 2018-19. The drop was especially pronounced in children; three out of five children hospitalized for the flu in 2022-23 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/ss/pdfs/ss7306a1-H.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; the medications, compared with four out of five in 2018-19. Only 28% of children under age five who are sick enough with the flu to see a doctor are prescribed antivirals, and only 32% of children who seek care for flu in emergency departments receive the treatments, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/hcp/trainings/seasonal_influenza_2025-2026.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, mortality among children is rising, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/cdc-flu-vaccination" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 300 children&lt;/a&gt; dying from the flu last season – the most deaths from the flu outside of a pandemic since the CDC started keeping track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="18f8319e-fa91-45ca-90e5-8cd07a6ecdc9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":17,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Health secretary RFK Jr appoints two vaccine skeptics to CDC advisory panel","elementId":"18f8319e-fa91-45ca-90e5-8cd07a6ecdc9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a patient is sick enough to seek care from a doctor, they should receive antivirals, Berman said, and so should patients with underlying medical conditions, pregnant people and older people. There are four antiviral medications for the flu, and they all work well against this variant. It’s best to start them as soon as possible after testing positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s also a risk, as H5N1 bird flu continues to devastate flocks across the US, of two flu variants &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/bird-flu-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mixing to create&lt;/a&gt; another, deadlier variant, a process called reassortment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What I worry about most with bird flu is, in five years, it will have reassorted to something else,” Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are effective ways to control the spread of the flu, Lakdawala said, noting “we have every tool in our arsenal” and “we should use them when anyone’s sick”. In addition to getting vaccinated and taking antivirals, people can wear face masks, improve ventilation, wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when they are sick to keep the flu in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We learned something really important about flu transmission during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that is that we can control it. We actually have the capacity to control flu disease burden,” Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Berman noted that “people are not helpless”, adding: “We can do something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQMzRrdTRROG5XVm4yTzd1dW9ocEhGOEpOQTczSVJMbUx6M2xrdUs5WF9sQ29hZjdhNjI5TU0waGJOLXZvM1VsRWNkZWU0dVZLT1hZM0ltc2pKMTFidXVFNmpFWnUtMnI0d0RsSzBTdmJzX0MzMWdVMWpkYS1IbTBfc0xrOTBGWnZZRjE3ajBwNzFNdw</guid></item><item><title>我看着我的妻子死于可怕的死亡。我以为我永远不会恢复—直到4个单词改变了我的生活。- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/caregiver-wife-brain-tumor-trauma-emdr_n_693c426fe4b0898f0300b3a1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been two years since I first met my Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapist. I tell myself I am much better than the day I met her, but I don’t always believe it. I still have moments when I completely shut down and feel unattached to anyone and anything. I still sometimes find myself uncontrollably crying. My entire body will still periodically start violently shaking, and the brain-piercing headaches still show up. However, it happens much less often, and the episodes are shorter. I still don’t always know what triggers these reactions, but I now know what they are, and I am able to find my way back from them more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first started EMDR after a visit to the emergency room for what I thought was a heart attack. My wife Lori had died two years earlier after a 23-year pugnacious fight with a malignant brain tumor. She was 28 years old when she was first diagnosed. We were told she would be dead by 30, but she refused to go without a fight, and she refused to let the treatments or the physical and cognitive issues she experienced get in the way of how she wanted to live her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lori started her own company, skied, hiked and traveled the world. And, in exchange for living a life filled with adventure, she accepted that she would periodically have a seizure and collapse on the street wherever she had been standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every three months, our lives would stop for a week while we waited for the results of an MRI that would tell us if our love affair was over. Along the way, she ended up having four brain surgeries, more rounds of chemotherapy than I have fingers and toes, and 70 days of radiation to her head. When the tumor finally won, it was only after it exacted its cruelest revenge. Lori not only lost her dignity, but she also spent a year fully paralyzed from head to toe, including her vocal cords and eyes. She was left fully aware but unable to see the world around her or communicate. I had a front row seat to witness the tumor’s mendacity, but without any ability to ease Lori’s suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give Lori the support she needed to keep living, I had to sacrifice the life I knew. I did so willingly and without a moment’s thought. I loved her with my entire being and could not imagine my world without her. But when she died, I never realized all that I had lost along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost my ability to care about anything beyond caring for her, lost all my hopes and dreams, lost thinking or even caring about a future, and lost any emotion tied to the life and death decisions we were making every day. I also lost my ability to show fear, sadness or pain in response to her disease because I felt I had to be strong for her. Ultimately, I lost my way and any connection to anyone else. There was no time to feel, much less grieve, what I was experiencing. I learned to move forward by just shutting down the loss as quickly as possible, burying my emotions and pressing forward. I dedicated myself to merely solving whatever problem was directly in front of me, and then pretending everything was normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Lori died, I still found it impossible to grieve. I lived in a heightened state of awareness, always ready to react. I would be filled with uncontrollable rage at the drop of a pin. I had no empathy for whatever someone else might be going through and found myself severed from any connection to the rest of the world. Despite how intense and debilitating this experience was, I hid my struggle. To the outside world, I appeared fine. I went to work every day, saw friends, and even started mountain biking, but I wasn’t actually present for any of it. I felt cold, distant, and trapped. It was as if I was floating above the world, watching it beneath me, but not part of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was home, I sat in the dark in silence. That is where I felt safe. Often when I ventured out, I would turn a corner and suddenly find myself crying and with a headache so severe I had to sit down on the sidewalk. One minute I could be driving my car, and the next I had to pull over because I was shaking so badly I couldn’t hold the steering wheel. I had no idea what was triggering these bouts and no idea how to control them, so I just sat still and waited until they were over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4571190000e1b87f3f95.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&amp;amp;format=webp 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4571190000e1b87f3f95.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440&amp;amp;format=webp 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="img" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="auto" alt="The author and Lori pumpkin picking in Eastern Long Island, New York." src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4571190000e1b87f3f95.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4571190000e1b87f3f95.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4571190000e1b87f3f95.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440 2x"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and Lori pumpkin picking in Eastern Long Island, New York.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Jon Kortmansky"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Jon Kortmansky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over two years after Lori’s death, I woke up in the middle of the night with a crushing pain in my chest and difficulty breathing. I thought I was dying, and I was ready for death. I actually only called 911 because I had made a promise to Lori years earlier that I would not die in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the EMTs arrived, my symptoms were indicative of a heart attack, and they pumped me full of the drugs to prevent any further damage. After five hours of tests in the hospital, I was told I hadn’t had a heart attack: I was in a constant state of panic. Even while I was sleeping, it was both absolutely shocking and not the least bit surprising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I confided in a friend who had been in the military, and he told me, “I know these symptoms; you’re suffering from trauma. You should try EMDR.” Those four words changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research on EMDR, &lt;a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/family/how_help_emdr.asp" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a treatment that helps people process traumatic memories" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693c426fe4b0898f0300b3a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/family/how_help_emdr.asp" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;a treatment that helps people process traumatic memories&lt;/a&gt;, and watched some YouTube videos, but I still didn’t really know what it was or how it worked. However, I knew that something needed to change. I couldn’t keep living — if you could call it that — the way I had been. I didn’t want to go through life disengaged, angry, unable to focus, and experiencing my unpredictable and uncontrollable episodes of shaking, crying and headaches. I couldn’t sleep, and when I did, I would awake in the middle of the night from nightmares that I had to remind myself were not real. Worst of all, I was completely indifferent to everyone and everything. I felt like I was trapped inside a box with no door, alone with years of agonizing memories flashing in front of me over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first EMDR session was simple enough. My therapist had a gentle demeanor and a kind face. She directed me to a brown couch with two small pillows, beside a small table with a box of tissues. I noticed there was no coffee table, and my therapist was seated directly in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began the session by explaining how the process would work. Each time we met, I would spend up to two hours reliving all of the memories that haunted me in excruciating detail. She emphasized that this would not be talk therapy and that I was going to re-experience my trauma in a safe place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told me that when some people suffer extreme trauma, their brain doesn’t organize their memories so that they remain in the past. Instead, they keep reliving them as if they’re still happening. I asked her if I could just forget them. She kindly and gently explained that I would have to live with those memories forever, but that if I did the work, I could forge a new path and begin life anew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no idea if EMDR would work for me, or how, but in that moment, I was so desperate for relief, I simply accepted what she was telling me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first few sessions were incredibly hard. I wore earphones and held vibrating stones in each hand. My therapist began the session by asking me to describe a memory. Then she turned on the EMDR machine and told me to notice my thoughts and what I was feeling in my body as I thought them. I initially felt and thought nothing, but soon, I was overcome with waves of physical and emotional reactions: shaking, crying and headaches. Anger, fear and guilt surfaced, and I felt them intensely, but I often couldn’t find the words to describe what I was feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I would ask my therapist if we could stop. She always said yes, but she would also ask me if that was what I really wanted. My response was usually no, but sometimes I felt completely overwhelmed by what I was experiencing. She taught me how to recover from the sessions and ground myself. For a long time, I couldn’t tell if I was making any progress, but about six months into my therapy, something happened: I found the strength to buy a new bed. I know this sounds trivial, but I was still sleeping in the bed where Lori died, and it was the place where she had suffered the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of Lori’s life, she could not swallow and would vomit uncontrollably while she slept. Because of this, she would aspirate constantly, and that liquid poured into her lungs, but due to her paralysis, there was no way to know that she was having difficulty. There was no coughing — nothing. Once in a while, a tear drop might fall from her eye, and I knew that she was suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day that Lori died in that bed, she was drowning in her own body fluids. There was nothing I could do except watch as she suffered for hours until it was over. I knew I should have bought a new bed the day after she died, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Finally, six months in EMDR, I finally could, and I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4576190000e1b87f3f97.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&amp;amp;format=webp 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4576190000e1b87f3f97.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440&amp;amp;format=webp 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="img" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="auto" alt="The author, right, and Lori, left, taking in the sunset at First Encounter Beach, Eastham, Massachusetts." src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4576190000e1b87f3f97.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4576190000e1b87f3f97.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/693c4576190000e1b87f3f97.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440 2x"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, right, and Lori, left, taking in the sunset at First Encounter Beach, Eastham, Massachusetts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Jon Kortmansky"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Jon Kortmansky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other new signs of my healing began to appear. Suddenly, I started to remember the names of people I met. I was able to engage in conversations. I recognized things that might be triggers, but more importantly, I was able to calm myself when I experienced a trauma episode. I started sleeping. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friends and family noticed I was smiling, and they said I looked happier. They hadn’t seen me like this for years. I was no longer angry all the time, and I started to engage with the world around me again. I found the courage to take on new adventures and started making new friends. I even found the courage to start dating. Essentially, I started truly living again — and, importantly, I realized I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many people are struggling with trauma and grief, and yet, we rarely talk about it. Most of us don’t know what to say when someone is grappling with these emotions, or we’re afraid to say the wrong thing, so we say nothing. For those of us in the throes of trauma and grief, there is often an expectation that after some amount of time, a switch will flip and we’ll suddenly feel better. That’s not how it works. The numbness, emotional shutdowns, and lack of connection or trust in yourself and others can remain for years — even decades. It can destroy relationships, choke joy and make you pull away from the people who might help you move forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found the hardest part about dealing with my trauma is that, for a long time, I thought I was alone. I was afraid to discuss the pain I was feeling with friends and family because I did not know how to explain what I was feeling, but also because I worried I wouldn’t be understood or even believed. When I did try to discuss it, the responses made me upset or feel even more isolated: “You’re still grieving, just give it time”; “Maybe you’re depressed. Have you thought about taking medication?” I often felt pity from people, as if I was damaged and not suffering with something real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved Lori with everything I had, and I’m grateful that she was in my life for as long as she was. I do not regret putting her life ahead of mine; I would do it again in a heartbeat. But those years took a toll on me that I didn’t anticipate, and after her disease had already taken so much from me, the memories of it continued to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;EMDR helped me recognize that I needed to find the courage within myself to want to change, and it gave me the strength and tools to do so. &lt;/span&gt;I know that I may always struggle with painful memories and moments where I may be overwhelmed by the trauma I have been through, but I also know that I have and will continue to heal, and am in a much better place. EMDR may not be the right tool for everyone, but speaking up and asking for help is the first step towards finding peace.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t have to stay locked inside our nightmares. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of life left in me, and I want to live as fully as I can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jon Kortmansky, a New York City lawyer, is writing a memoir celebrating his life with his beloved late wife Lori — and how the enduring strength of her love guided him to discover new hope, love and joy in his next chapter.

(Instagram/@hayleigh_fit)&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Walk your way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayleigh calls walking “the most underrated form of exercise” and swears by it. She recommends 30–45 minutes of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/walking" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="walking"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, ideally outdoors, for fresh air, movement, and a mental reset. To make it more effective and enjoyable, she suggests adding a weighted vest or tuning into a favourite podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Drink enough water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking enough water was a game-changer for her. Hayleigh aims for about half her body weight in ounces each day, for example, someone weighing 200 pounds would target roughly 100 ounces. Staying hydrated helped curb cravings and boost energy, and she also adds electrolytes once a day for an extra lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Eat protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein played a key role in keeping her full and supporting &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-trainer-warns-excess-protein-may-cause-weight-gain-protein-only-helps-fat-loss-when-101768528672488.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fat loss"&gt;fat loss&lt;/a&gt;. She targets at least 100 grams a day, which helps manage hunger and build muscle, essential for burning fat. As she puts it, the approach is simple, not complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Start mornings intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the day with purpose was one of her most impactful habits. This could include working out, meditating, or simply being present. Her rule: no phone for the first 30 minutes. She suggests trying this for two weeks to notice reduced &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/stress" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, better sleep, improved focus, and enhanced mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Include fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre rounds out her essentials. Hayleigh follows a simple rule: include three servings of vegetables a day. Fibre aids digestion, keeps you full, and helps process carbs more easily, what she calls a way to “keep the scale scaries away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A massive study of more than 18,000 people has revealed that "&lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2025/08/12/what-makes-a-superager/"&gt;SuperAgers&lt;/a&gt;" – people unusually resistant to dementia in older age – have at least two key genetic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is this population of adults aged 80+ much less likely to carry &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;a gene variant that's associated with higher Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt;, but they're also more likely to carry one associated with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a result that shows that, while genes are far from the only factor at play, exceptional memory in old age is at least partly written into the superager genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was our most striking finding," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112882"&gt;says neuropsychologist Leslie Gaynor&lt;/a&gt; of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although all adults who reach the age of 80 without receiving a diagnosis of clinical dementia exhibit exceptional aging, our study suggests that the superager phenotype can be used to identify a particularly exceptional group of oldest-old adults with a reduced genetic risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="189217" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-reveals-crucial-differences"&gt;Blood of Exceptionally Long-Lived People Reveals Crucial Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers are a population whose memories can best be described as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.6034"&gt;exceptional among their demographic&lt;/a&gt;, rivalling those of people &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610224000024"&gt;decades younger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't just manifest as cognitive sharpness. Superagers also appear far less likely to develop dementia than the general population. Scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.0627"&gt;would like to know&lt;/a&gt; how this occurs, because it may offer insights into some of the mechanisms behind dementia, as well as possible strategies for delay and mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With interest in superagers growing," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112882"&gt;Gaynor says&lt;/a&gt;, "our findings notably encourage the view that the superager phenotype will prove useful in the continued search for mechanisms conferring resilience to Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;It's well established&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;span&gt;ε4 &lt;/span&gt;variant of the gene Apolipoprotein E (&lt;i&gt;APOE)&lt;/i&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2021.10.002"&gt;strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, a neurodegenerative condition with no known cure, characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive function, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sad-case-of-the-youngest-person-ever-to-be-diagnosed-with-alzheimers"&gt;usually in old age&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, the gene variant &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-ε2 is associated with a much &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-gene-variant-seems-to-protect-you-from-alzheimers-disease"&gt;lower risk of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging studies have shown differences in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;brain structure&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;resistance to the amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; associated with Alzheimer's between SuperAgers and the rest of the population. Gaynor, her co-lead author, statistical genetic analyst Alaina Durant of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and their colleagues wanted to study what role, if any, genetics plays in superager status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research was based on an analysis of data collected from 18,080 people across eight large aging studies conducted in the US. These studies included tests of cognitive performance across the memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial domains, as well as genetic data collected from the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study defined superagers as those aged 80 and older whose cognitive performance exceeded the average score of cognitively normal participants aged 50–64. In total, the participants included 1,623 superagers, 8,829 people with Alzheimer's disease, and 7,628 cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among non-Hispanic White people, who made up the majority of study participants, the results indicated that superagers were 68 percent less likely to carry APOE-ε4 than participants with Alzheimer's disease. Crucially, they were 19 percent less likely to carry APOE-ε4 than age-matched cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, non-Hispanic White (NHW) superagers were 103 percent more likely to carry the protective APOE-ε2 allele than NHW participants with Alzheimer's disease, and 28 percent more likely than NHW cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small sample of non-Hispanic Black people in this study showed similar patterns, but the researchers acknowledge that we need more studies with a larger group of non-Hispanic Black superagers to properly determine if resilience factors vary by population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings imply that in some populations, superagers don't avoid Alzheimer's by chance; they're genetically different even from other people who age well, with their genomes tilting the odds against Alzheimer's in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is by far the largest study to date to identify differences in &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-ε4 allele frequency based on superager status, and the first study to find a relationship between &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-ε2 allele frequency and superager status," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112882"&gt;Gaynor says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect these findings to lend continued interest to questions of how these variants may influence development of clinical dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the superager phenotype more generally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Instagram video of a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; fighting waves on the beach turns a simple fetch into a mini pirate quest. Hudson plants his paws at the surf line and watches the foam creep closer. He darts in for the “loot,” then hops back before the next wave hits. The Pirates of the Caribbean-style music makes it feel like a mission. He keeps returning until he finally grabs the prize. It is a golden retriever beach-waves clip built for replay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-shows-golden-retriever-bravely-battling-waves-to-claim-treasure-at-the-beach"&gt;Video shows Golden Retriever bravely battling waves to claim treasure at the beach&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reel was posted by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTiYUsvjbmS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;@hudsonbegood&lt;/a&gt;, which follows Hudson B. Mason. The page calls him “The Goodest Golden Good Boy” and lists NYC and New Jersey. The clip was shared about 18 hours ago. Hudson wears a blue harness as he patrols the shoreline. On-screen text reads, “Never give up on your dreams!” The caption says, “Even scary waves can’t stop me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this video, Hudson spots a round brown object on the wet sand. It looks like a coconut shell or a piece of driftwood treasure. He leans in to bite it, but the water rushes forward. Hudson jumps back and keeps his eyes on the foam. When the surf slides away, he steps in again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hudson finally snatches it and trots up the beach. Another wave chases his paws, so he pivots away. He pauses at a safe spot and waits for the water to recede. Then he charges back, grabs his prize, and retreats again. The back-and-forth makes the moment feel dramatic and goofy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reactions were playful and impressed. One commenter wrote, “Perfect dramatic music.” Another said, “They tell stories about Hudson’s bravery far and wide one of our favorites of Hudson ever.” A third added, “he is so brave! Not afraid!” One wrote, “You are such a brave boy and good for you for going back to get what you wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners were supposed to make sugary foods and beverages healthier, but today, some of the most popular zero-calorie substitutes are raising &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-low-doses-of-aspartame-could-have-alarming-health-effects-study-finds"&gt;new concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An up-and-coming natural alternative could one day be produced on a much grander scale, using enzymes from slime mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural sugar is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagatose"&gt;tagatose&lt;/a&gt;, and not only does it taste 92 percent as sweet as sucrose (or table sugar), but it also packs only around a third of the calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's particularly exciting about it is that it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8718053"&gt;does not spike insulin levels&lt;/a&gt; like sucrose or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_329_19"&gt;high-intensity artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; – making it a potentially attractive option for those with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="189055" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or blood glucose issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-low-doses-of-aspartame-could-have-alarming-health-effects-study-finds"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even Low Doses of Aspartame Could Have Alarming Health Effects, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Tufts University, &lt;span&gt;in partnership with biotechnology companies Manus Bio (US) and Kcat Enzymatic (India),&lt;/span&gt; have now led a proof-of-principle study to show that tagatose can be produced sustainably and efficiently – a challenge that has so far &lt;a href="https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/tagatose-market-22465"&gt;held the market back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagatose is a rare natural sweetener, found in only small amounts in some dairy products and fruits. It offers a potentially healthier option to sucrose as well as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, which can both drive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-key-way-of-consuming-sugar-could-spike-your-diabetes-risk"&gt;strong spikes in insulin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key reason that tagatose doesn't have the same effect is that much of it appears to be fermented in the large intestine. It's only partially absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189125" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/SweetenerStudy.jpg" alt="Sweetener Study" class="wp-image-189125 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/SweetenerStudy.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/SweetenerStudy-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189125" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Previous studies have linked the artificial sweetener aspartame to heart disease.

Unlike sucrose, which feeds certain bacteria in the mouth that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbiologists-explain-what-happens-in-your-mouth-when-you-eat-sugar"&gt;contribute to tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;, initial research suggests that tagatose limits the growth of harmful oral microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big perk is that tagatose can be baked into foods, unlike many other high-intensity sweetener substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential is there, but so far, the tagatose market has been &lt;a href="https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/tagatose-market-22465"&gt;constrained by limited production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/12/11/researchers-develop-way-make-healthier-sugar-substitute"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biological engineer Nik Nair from Tufts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, researchers inserted into these bacteria a newly discovered enzyme from slime mold, called galactose-1-phosphate-selective phosphatase (Gal1P). This enzyme converts glucose into galactose, and that product is then turned into tagatose by a second enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this novel sequence, Nair and colleagues have shown that production yields for tagatose can reach up to 95 percent, which is much better than the roughly 40 to 77 percent currently achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key innovation in the biosynthesis of tagatose was in finding the slime mold Gal1P enzyme and splicing it into our production bacteria," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/12/11/researchers-develop-way-make-healthier-sugar-substitute"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That allowed us to reverse a natural biological pathway that metabolizes galactose to glucose and instead generate galactose from glucose supplied as a feedstock. Tagatose and potentially other rare sugars can be synthesized from that point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team still needs to further optimize their tagatose production line, but they hope their strategy provides a useful framework for future rare-sugar production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/tagatose-market-22465"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt;, the tagatose market is expected to reach a value of US$250 million by 2032.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2025.102993"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Physical Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Ellie Rudd will be buried in a light blue and white Princess Elsa costume, made for her as a last gift from her aunt. “Frozen” was one of her favorite movies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00063b6szzrgva93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rambunctious 4-year-old – who loved mud and getting dressed up and having dance parties with her brother and sisters – died January 6, after the flu and a co-infection with an adenovirus turned into pneumonia and sepsis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00073b6sqes7ey2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She was probably my healthiest of all my kids,” said her mom, Sarah Rudd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00083b6s80q0gt6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She had no medical issues. No eczema, no cavities in her teeth, nothing.  She was completely healthy,” she said. “I have no idea why it hit her so hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00093b6syipx7ra1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This season, at least 17 children in the United States have died from the flu, a number that will grow as more states report their numbers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last flu season, which spanned the winter between 2024 and 2025, set a record for the most pediatric deaths in a season, with 289.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000a3b6ssrpbecmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year’s flu season has proved to be even busier than last year’s, with outpatient visits for “flu-like” symptoms reaching their highest level in nearly 30 years, driven by a new virus strain called subclade K. And infectious disease experts fear this year may turn out to be even deadlier than last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000b3b6ssyw3ur68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There was a strain that emerged after we had a chance to make the predictions for our current flu shots, so it was too late to change any of our vaccines,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Although subclade K isn’t included in this year’s shots, studies have shown that many people do generate antibodies against it when given the current flu vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000c3b6s2r9dmwjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, “we’re seeing what happens when there’s a bit of a mismatch and when enthusiasm over getting vaccinated is low, and again, that one-two punch is leading to a really significant flu year,” Creech said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000e3b6s0os0bg04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu arrived at the Rudds’ house in Ogden, Utah, on Christmas Day. &lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000f3b6sagma42ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah, a mom of four, was the first to get sick. She had it for about a week, she says. “It was pretty rough, but everybody else seemed to be just fine,” she remembers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000g3b6sigeefrp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then the baby, 14-month-old Dani, developed a fever that would come and go, but she seemed to bounce back quickly. After that, dad Michael also began having intermittent fevers. By the time he began feeling better, the three older children – Mary Jane, 6; Ellie; and 3-year-old Kyler – had caught it, too. They began showing symptoms on New Year’s Day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000h3b6sgzrvw7xm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Neither Michael nor I have ever had the flu shot before, and so we just don’t think about getting it,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000i3b6sv3si63ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Honestly, I don’t even know if it would have helped in this situation, as it seems like it might have been a different strain,” she said. “We don’t know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000j3b6sl2101bb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the most part, Sarah says, people have been kind, but she and her husband have also been hurt by comments from strangers who second-guessed their medical decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000k3b6s0xh8uzq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I feel that we made the best choice that we could at the time,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000m3b6stggpb9v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Initially, Mary Jane seemed to be the worst off of the three older kids. Her fevers spiked to 102 degrees, so Sarah began alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol to keep them under control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000n3b6sdpf7zyid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellie and Kyler seemed to quickly return to their normal energetic selves after a dose of children’s ibuprofen that first morning, Sarah said, but by the next day, they were also spiking high fevers and needed more than one medicine to stay comfortable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000o3b6schxn6u7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On January 2, Ellie fell asleep on the couch, so Sarah woke her up and sent her to bed.  A few minutes later, Kyler, who shares the bedroom with Ellie, walked out with his sister and said, “Mommy, Ellie needs you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000p3b6sn5gnasep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellie’s cough had turned into a harsh bark, “and I was like ‘crap, what is that?’ ” Sarah said, “I didn’t like the sound of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000q3b6s4wrmejh7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah bundled Ellie up and drove her to a local hospital, where Ellie tested positive for both the flu and adenovirus, which can also cause respiratory illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000r3b6s9kw0iuf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah learned that Ellie’s cough was called croup and was due to swelling around her vocal cords, which can happen with viral infections. An X-ray didn’t show any signs of pneumonia, but her blood oxygen level was only 85%, so the medical staff gave her some supplemental oxygen and the antiviral Tamiflu and told Sarah they wanted to keep her overnight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000s3b6s12w639pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought they’d just give us something and send us home,” Sarah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000t3b6s9incwijd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellie woke up coughing throughout the night. She would cry a little and go back to sleep. Around 3 or 4 a.m., she began to complain of pain in her lower abdomen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000u3b6sbsynmhks@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next day, the attending doctor examined her and said everything was going well. The hospital was preparing to discharge her when her oxygen level began to drop again, and that afternoon, Ellie started throwing up blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000v3b6soz4lko0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was bleeding internally, but doctors didn’t know where the blood was coming from.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000w3b6s8u0faxop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A follow-up X-ray revealed that Ellie had developed pneumonia in one of her lungs overnight. She had also developed sepsis, overwhelming inflammation in the body in response to an infection. It can trigger a dangerous condition that causes both uncontrolled bleeding and clotting at the same time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000x3b6se8pasapv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Paramedics airlifted Ellie to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, but they struggled to keep her blood oxygen up. At the hospital, Ellie was put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a machine that takes over the work of the heart and lungs to give the body time to recover.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000y3b6suedby6t2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On January 5, the doctors explained that Ellie had developed blood clots in her heart, but she was too fragile for surgery to remove them. They discussed trying a blood thinning medication, but that was risky because she had already had internal bleeding.

            As the Rudds were talking to doctors about Ellie’s dire situation, Sarah’s phone rang. It was her mother, who was watching the two older children, Kyler and Mary Jane, who were both still sick. Mary Jane had also developed pneumonia, along with bronchitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00103b6s6nxiz12n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was just an absolute … you know … shitshow, I want to say, but it’s too crass of a way to say it,” Sarah said. “There’s no other way to really say it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00113b6sfctdx7yl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was devastating,” she said. “It was absolute chaos and terrible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00123b6seaprwqyj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just with Ellie, everything was getting from bad to worse, and there was just never any good spot that we were in,” Sarah said. “I couldn’t stop crying for a while, and I felt like I’d lost all hope at that point. I tried to hold on to some hope, but there wasn’t much left.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00133b6sksrtxm7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It hit her so fast and so hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00143b6svcm2bwuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The blood thinners didn’t help. Twelve hours later, Ellie had a massive stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00153b6s0embb5pg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The left side of her brain had no brain activity,” Sarah said. “It was just time to let her go at that point.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Creech, of Vanderbilt, said the details of Ellie’s story are tragic but familiar. He has seen some children with flu that gets worse very quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00183b6seypqdt0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We talk about this a lot in pediatrics. They don’t mean to, but young children often lie to us. They look like they are doing OK until they really aren’t,” he said.  “The younger the child is, the more quickly things can change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00193b6s4kpvj1a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he evaluates kids, he looks at three types of physical signs: How are they breathing?  Are there neurologic symptoms? Are they hydrated?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001a3b6svujcdjmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, parents should keep an eye on how fast a child is breathing and how hard they’re working to breathe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001b3b6sawmegnfp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Do they have tough or labored breathing, where they’re really having to tug at it to do it?” Creech said. “Are they having to use extra muscles around their neck or their ribs to breathe? That would be a red flag.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001c3b6sm0isrdmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For neurologic symptoms, he says, it’s important to check to see if a child is lethargic, even if they don’t have a fever. Have they lost interest in eating or drinking or interacting with you?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001d3b6syw0zodnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s a really important feature, that they’re shunting all of their energy away from watching a show or interacting with you as a parent, to just trying to breathe and trying to stay in an OK spot,” Creech said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001e3b6s79aapysl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finally, he says, a child who is breathing too fast can quickly become dehydrated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001f3b6syycu1w3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And when kids get dehydrated, unfortunately, that makes them not want to drink even more. It makes them vomit, and so sometimes they get even further behind,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001g3b6s9w12h06m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another good test is whether kids feel better after medication. If Tylenol or ibuprofen brings their fever down, do they perk up?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001h3b6s6iv8wkyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What most of us will do is give some Tylenol or give some Motrin and then, after about an hour, reassess. And if the child looks great, is drinking, is watching a show, OK, that makes us feel better,” he said. “But if they are now still feeling poorly, even when the fever comes down, that’s another one of those red flags for needing a little bit more evaluation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Rudd family said their goodbyes to Ellie in the hospital on January 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001k3b6syx6xkvk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family and friends have rallied around them as they struggle to get through each day without their daughter. Family members have &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/honoring-the-life-and-legacy-of-ellie-rudd" target="_blank"&gt;started a GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to defray medical and funeral expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Sarah says the other kids are doing their best to cope.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001m3b6sz2pe2839@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The other day, we were dropping off a dress for Ellie to be buried in, and Kyler was asking if Ellie had her wings now and she was an angel up in heaven. And I said, ‘yes,’ because we are religious, and so I think he understands some, but I just don’t know how much,” Sarah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001n3b6so2v2jm1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mary Jane is older and has been more subdued. She’s recovering well from her own illness, and “she’s finally started to kind of come back to herself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001o3b6smf4vy7s3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked whether she had a message for other parents, Sarah said Ellie’s death had prompted the family to rethink the importance of flu shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001p3b6syfmkufoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Honestly, just get your flu shots,” she said. “Even if it doesn’t work this year, maybe it could have helped her a little bit. We don’t really know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001q3b6s90zdib25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Probably next season, we’ll look into getting the flu shot for our kids and us,” Sarah said. “So just extra peace of mind.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001r3b6s6qu701xn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said it would be the first time anyone in their family had been vaccinated against the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001s3b6szgl2hh0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve never been afraid of sickness before, but now I’m a little terrified.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

At the University of California, San Diego medical library – where I was a postdoc in neurobiology – I searched for treatment options, only to confirm his physician’s prognosis: the disease was terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat in the library carrel crying. It was 1982, long before online searches. I had just turned 30. Kenny, across the country, was 33 with a seven-year-old son. I worried about my nephew growing up without a father. Despair for my brother, myself and the rest of my family &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;overwhelmed me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were little, Kenny treated me kindly as long as no one else was around. But when his friends came over, he made fun of me. I was a nerdy student. Kenny would ditch his homework and alter grades on his report card, faking our parents’ signatures. Only when he discovered flying did he become an eager learner. He worked as a sales rep for Oneida silverware, but his passion was piloting planes. He flew moguls in private aircraft and gave flying lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny didn’t want to hear about a timeframe, choosing to live as normally as possible for as long as he could. We started talking weekly by phone, sometimes more often. Two months into this routine, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;was 54.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured the three of us had all been exposed to some kind of carcinogen, but why did they develop cancer while I had not? They drank more diet soda than I did. Maybe it was the saccharin? I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. I began looking at people, wondering from their faces how you grow old. What was the secret to surviving?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;enny, Matthew and I went all-in on a macrobiotic diet – low-fat, lots of brown rice, protein mostly from plant foods like nuts but with some fish thrown in. The science wasn’t robust, but we needed to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something. Matthew and I each lost about &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;25 pounds;&lt;/span&gt; we became positively scrawny. Kenny couldn’t take eating cold rice for lunch at work; the regimen drove him crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, I flew back east to be with him during his final hospital stay. ‘I’m never coming out,’ he had said to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that last visit, I told him I was proud of him: he had stayed true to his goal, doing what he loved. Late one night, as I kept vigil, he woke briefly and we waved to each other across the darkened hospital room. ‘I’m here for you,’ I was telling him silently. ‘We’re going to go through whatever happens together.’ His own wave signalled he was happy not to be alone. Within a couple of hours, he slipped into a coma and succumbed the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;next day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Still reeling from Kenny’s death, I wasn’t ready to lose my mother&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long after, Matthew and I married. I wanted to have children after Kenny died; I wanted something positive to happen in my family, soon, before it was too late. We moved back east, too. It was time to come home, and I took a position running a neurobiology lab in Massachusetts, just a few hours’ drive from my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith, named for Kenny, was born in 1988, and my mother was still holding on. But the chemo ravaged her body, and at one point her kidney function flickered dangerously. When the cancer spread to her bone, she underwent radiation. The oncologist told me the cancer was everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t process it. In retrospect, I realise he was trying to prepare me. But my mother’s breast surgeon kept saying she should ‘keep fighting’. He never said cure, but I held on to his optimism. Still reeling from Kenny’s death, I wasn’t ready to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;lose her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;our years later, I was expecting again. I was 40 going on 41. My mother, still alive, had turned 64. I gave birth to a second son we named Gary, Kenny’s middle name, and right afterwards my mother came to stay with us for three wonderful weeks. But the cancer and the pain were getting the better of her. Her doctor, the optimistic one, took a leave of absence; he said he needed a break from the stress of losing people he cared about, a break that wasn’t available &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started visiting my mother every weekend and, when she became bedridden, we’d put Gary on the mattress with her. One Sunday night, driving home, I told Matthew it was a mistake to leave. We returned the next day. She was looking at Gary beside her when she smiled for the last time. Making sure she had time with the boys was my gift to her when I couldn’t give her anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Even when I was checked for lumps during physicals, my doctor never suggested genetic testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, in 1997, I was recruited by Tufts University to run a neurobiology lab at the medical school there. Matthew and I eased up on macrobiotics, but we continued to eat healthfully with lots of plant foods, bought a house closer to my new office, and raised our two bright, active sons. Around the same time, the BRCA gene was discovered, showing a connection to breast and ovarian cancer and then to pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t aware of the discovery. While I had been studying genetics as a neuroscientist for close to two decades, my field wasn’t cancer but the influence of genes on neurons, impacting how they send – or fail to send – messages across synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:-ml-[150px] lg:pl-10 print:hidden [&amp;amp;_a]:no-underline [&amp;amp;_p]:m-0" aria-labelledby="_S_2_"&gt;&lt;div class="border-psyche-stone-500 border-t-[1.5px] py-6 last-of-type:pb-0"&gt;&lt;article class="group/card relative flex items-start gap-4 pr-8 shadow-[0_0_0_.5rem] shadow-transparent transition-[background-color,box-shadow] hover:bg-white/50 hover:shadow-white/50 section-understand" aria-labelledby="_S_4_"&gt;&lt;div class="min-w-0 flex-1"&gt;&lt;h4 class="mb-2 text-pretty font-medium text-base leading-[23px] transition-colors group-hover/card:text-section" id="_S_4_"&gt;Why some healthy habits still take so much effort&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="spacing front-meta font-medium text-psyche-warm-grey-75 text-xs uppercase tracking-widest"&gt;Blair Saunders &amp;amp; Kimberly R More&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="absolute -inset-2" aria-labelledby="_S_4_" data-ga-inline-related="You may like" href="/ideas/why-some-healthy-habits-still-take-so-much-effort"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;button type="button" class="group/save z-9 flex h-5 items-center absolute top-0 right-0 rounded-sm hover:bg-psyche-stone-100 hover:shadow-sm focus:bg-psyche-stone-100 focus:shadow-sm"&gt;&lt;span class="w-0 overflow-hidden pr-2 pl-0.5 text-sm opacity-0 group-hover/save:w-auto group-hover/save:opacity-100 group-focus/save:w-auto group-focus/save:opacity-100 group-[:not(:is(:focus,:hover))]/save:px-0!"&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="stroke-current shrink-0 stroke-[1.5]" role="graphics-symbol"&gt;&lt;path d="M12.6666 14L7.99992 10.6667L3.33325 14V3.33333C3.33325 2.97971 3.47373 2.64057 3.72378 2.39052C3.97382 2.14048 4.31296 2 4.66659 2H11.3333C11.6869 2 12.026 2.14048 12.2761 2.39052C12.5261 2.64057 12.6666 2.97971 12.6666 3.33333V14Z" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -inset-1 pointer-coarse:-inset-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="border-psyche-stone-500 border-t-[1.5px] py-6 last-of-type:pb-0"&gt;&lt;article class="group/card relative flex items-start gap-4 pr-8 shadow-[0_0_0_.5rem] shadow-transparent transition-[background-color,box-shadow] hover:bg-white/50 hover:shadow-white/50 section-transcend" aria-labelledby="_S_5_"&gt;&lt;div class="min-w-0 flex-1"&gt;&lt;h4 class="mb-2 text-pretty font-medium text-base leading-[23px] transition-colors group-hover/card:text-section" id="_S_5_"&gt;How to start learning dance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="spacing front-meta font-medium text-psyche-warm-grey-75 text-xs uppercase tracking-widest"&gt;Dawn Davis Loring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="absolute -inset-2" aria-labelledby="_S_5_" data-ga-inline-related="You may like" href="/guides/how-to-start-learning-dance-for-fun-fitness-or-connection"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;button type="button" class="group/save z-9 flex h-5 items-center absolute top-0 right-0 rounded-sm hover:bg-psyche-stone-100 hover:shadow-sm focus:bg-psyche-stone-100 focus:shadow-sm"&gt;&lt;span class="w-0 overflow-hidden pr-2 pl-0.5 text-sm opacity-0 group-hover/save:w-auto group-hover/save:opacity-100 group-focus/save:w-auto group-focus/save:opacity-100 group-[:not(:is(:focus,:hover))]/save:px-0!"&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="stroke-current shrink-0 stroke-[1.5]" role="graphics-symbol"&gt;&lt;path d="M12.6666 14L7.99992 10.6667L3.33325 14V3.33333C3.33325 2.97971 3.47373 2.64057 3.72378 2.39052C3.97382 2.14048 4.31296 2 4.66659 2H11.3333C11.6869 2 12.026 2.14048 12.2761 2.39052C12.5261 2.64057 12.6666 2.97971 12.6666 3.33333V14Z" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -inset-1 pointer-coarse:-inset-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when Angelina Jolie inserted the BRCA gene into the public’s consciousness – by publishing an &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;op ed&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2013 about her decision to undergo a double mastectomy after she tested positive for the BRCA mutation – I didn’t make the connection. I was still thinking my family’s cancers had come from an environmental insult – if I was thinking about it at all. My mother had been gone almost &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20 years.&lt;/span&gt; While cancer was always in the background for me, I was healthy and living my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lack of attention to a genetic possibility was influenced by the fact that my mother had a sister and a brother, and neither of them nor any of their children had developed cancer. My mothers’ parents hadn’t died of cancer, either. The disease had just come for my own nuclear family. Even when I was checked for lumps during physicals, my doctor never suggested genetic testing. If someone &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;suggested it, I don’t know that I would have followed through. To me cancer had a death sentence. Why learn of a future I couldn’t do anything about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hen my shoe dropped. Late in 2018, after I had just turned 67, a friend was moving out of state. Wanting to travel light, she gave me a gigantic plant in a heavy pot. Carrying it from the car into my house, I pulled some muscles in my chest, and after a couple of days one side healed, but the other side still felt funny. I decided to go for a new mammogram, and something didn’t look right. While waiting for the biopsy results, I braced for death, for a drawn-out, painful journey to the end. Kenny was in such horrible pain just before he died that he said he would have killed himself if he could have. Sure enough, the result came back positive. I feared I would never know my grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One breast oncologist recommended a lumpectomy, followed by a test for the BRCA gene mutation. But a second oncologist said: ‘No way are we doing anything until we get genetic testing.’ She explained the results would help me decide whether to go with more aggressive options – remove one breast, remove both, remove the ovaries. A faulty gene would mean the cancer could keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;So far, I am healthy. But I will never be cancer-free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test came back positive; the genetics counsellor credited my years of healthful eating and active lifestyle for &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;delaying it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malignancy was very small but, armed with the BRCA result, I opted for a prophylactic double mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy. The decision proved prescient. After the operation, the pathology report showed precancerous spots in the other breast. I also chose removal of both ovaries as recommended. I was put on tamoxifen for five years to block oestrogen receptors that could help cancer develop and grow. Today, seven years later and almost 74, I go for annual testing, with pancreatic monitoring the priority. It can’t ever be said that every last cancer cell was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I am healthy. But I will never be cancer-free. Keith, a clone of Matthew, tested negative for the BRCA mutation, so he will never have to worry. Which means neither will my granddaughter, his toddler, Amina. Kenny’s son, my nephew Jeffrey, and his own son are off the hook, too. But not Gary, not my sweet later-in-life boy who resembles Kenny &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;and me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hasn’t yet opted for monitoring, which would include a close watch on his pancreas and prostate as well as breast self-exams. I have my annual checkup with my oncologist coming up, and I know she’s going to ask where he stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s reasonable to suspect that within Gary’s lifetime science will come up with gene therapy to correct the genetic malfunction. But probably not during mine. In the meantime, it’s a holding pattern. Monitoring is Gary’s decision, just as it was mine. He is 33, the same age Kenny was when he was diagnosed. I am back to researching possibilities for effective treatment – and, this time, prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Psyche</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQcnptd09JdndKRkZITmdfZHhGQzBodHdCaGEtNzVtX2tlY0lMSXZaXzNUR21kT1BxYTJuY1pkQ2hCREVGaktOU05IeUJHSlNHZ1FfQjN5NXVTMmRLbEJ6VEdtV3d1U1psTWFrQm5LQ2ROTFBsbnB4a3hWcGhDQlQyWlVoSGpZVWZvY3NPRkJOcUlEWmM4</guid></item><item><title>科学表明，非常不同的精神疾病可能有相同的原因-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/01/psychiatric-disorders-genetic-bipolar-schizophrenia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IED2HYHXFZGF3IKGSUXKKG2BZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A sweeping new study of psychiatric and genetic records has the potential to change treatment for millions of psychiatric patients, finding that many conditions involve similar genes and may not need to be treated as distinct illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOM0h2VW1oTDNfbVZJN3doNzdZMkJsWkVERlNjYl96Y2VUaUhKbkdBTDZDN2RiNUt0OFZDd3hBQTJseGhSck90cE1ZMndHM2FvbTFWZ3pESmdnb29LWnBOUjQyMHFoOWJRa0pTQWFWMnB5Y1FkZFYzTzhHMkl3cF9CS2ZYNXpBTWZlREVPWWo5Z29CT3BKZ1JrdS1LRFNLajFhR2ZJ</guid></item><item><title>什么是“代谢健康” ，为什么重要？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/well/metabolic-health.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5qMG94RUhtSGEtRlZHZGZ0OEpzenoxazVFdTJyXzNtVUNMbkdWSWlRRzFRVnNBSTdzMWpFcl9CbHpuZUtDVkp1c1NwOGtIcEtnSUtyWHB4NkVyX2dvWFFYUUVwOTE1bHpoZUtMc1hB</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现可以阻止有害炎症的自然“刹车” - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-scientists-natural-inflammation.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

And fibre might be the most underappreciated longevity nutrient that you’re missing daily,” Dr Vass says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Explaining why fibre plays such a crucial role, the doctor highlights the connection between &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/what-is-hydrogen-water-gut-health-expert-decodes-this-wellness-trend-and-explains-benefits-side-101768214013137.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; and overall well-being. “Here’s the secret, your gut microbes eat what you don’t digest,” he explains. These microbes convert fibre into powerful compounds that protect the body. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;They turn fibre into short-chain fatty acids, which act as your body’s natural anti-inflammatory molecules,” Dr Vass says, adding that chronic inflammation is closely linked to ageing and disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of fibre diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance, fibre intake remains shockingly low. “Most people barely hit half of what they actually need,” he notes. To support &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cancer-surgeon-says-the-gut-cancer-connection-is-real-explains-why-managing-your-blood-sugar-matters-for-longevity-101764937575165.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Vass recommends aiming higher. “Try to get 30 to 40 grams of fibre a day from foods like beans, vegetables, chia seeds, and oats,” he says. He also stresses the importance of variety: “When you can, add colour and variety, because different fibres feed different microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;The benefits, he says, can show up faster than expected. “Within a couple of weeks, people often notice steadier energy, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/should-you-eat-flax-seeds-know-why-they-deserve-a-spot-in-your-diet-for-better-digestion-and-heart-health-101766235320698.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="better digestion"&gt;better digestion&lt;/a&gt;, and sharper focus,” Dr Vass explains. Summing it up, he adds, “It’s not trendy, it’s foundational.

It isn’t that she’s actually trapped, but her brain decided gravity no longer works. Looking at her face, you can tell she’s reached a point of total surrender. She is just waiting for a miracle — or at least a hand — to get her back on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever stays incredibly still in this awkward position&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the video, we see the Golden Retriever sitting awkwardly and stuck on the chair. It defies all logic. One leg is tucked away, while the rest of her is sprawled on the seat of the chair. Her front paws are stretched in front, hovering inches above the floor. Yet she refuses to move or hop down. She truly believes she is “stuck” and you can’t convince her otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her human caught the whole thing on camera, simply captioning the moment with a perfect, “Welp.” We see the helpless blinking from every possible angle. A Golden Retriever can be pretty athletic when they want, but Mochi seems to have glitched. She sits like a statue, occasionally giving a slow, disappointed blink at the lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At one point, she even lets out a tiny wink. It is like she is sending a secret SOS signal to her followers. She is such a funny character! We have seen her &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/sleepy-golden-retriever-fear-missing-140420442.html" data-ylk="slk:fight sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;fight sleep&lt;/a&gt; before due to FOMO, but this furniture “stale-mate” is a new high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hundreds of people reacted to the video, with one commenter begging the owner to “send help.” It is hard not to laugh at her sweet, confused face while she stares at nothing. She looks like she is pondering every life choice that led to this chair crisis. One viewer joked that they are just so funny when they overthink simple movements. Most of us have been Mochi at some point — waiting for someone else to solve a problem we created. Here’s hoping she got off the chair soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a

Department has confirmed three new cases of measles connected to children who were exposed to a contagious family who was visiting from South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;According to the health department, three new cases constitute an outbreak, “a sign the disease is now spreading locally.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;The children tested positive for the virus that causes measles on Wednesday, Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;The health department said these children had experienced fever, cough and rashes consistent with measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;They were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;“We’re expecting more measles cases as a result of the previous exposures as well as these new outbreak cases,” said Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. James Lewis. “We are hoping to contain it, but unfortunately there have been a number of exposure sites already and there are likely more cases in the community that we do not know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;The health department said that most people have immumnity to measles through vaccination, so the risk to the general public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;The state health department was consulted before the “outbreak” was declared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

ContinueReading_continue-reading__uTArZ active ContinueReading_active__SOMMR"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborn babies, federal data shows, which Long Island doctors said is leaving more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infants vulnerable to a rare but life-threatening bleeding disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of 5 million newborns revealed that the number of babies who did not receive the shot increased 77% from about 2.9% in 2017 to 5.2% in 2024, according to a &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/protective-vitamin-shots-newborns-decline"&gt;National Institutes of Health study&lt;/a&gt; released last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors on Long Island said they are seeing the ramifications in their hospitals, sometimes with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_1451S"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Over the last two years, Stony Brook Children's Hospital has had to hospitalize at least five children who had not received the vitamin K dose, said Dr. Candice &lt;span id="cke_bm_1451E"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Foy, a pediatrician and medical director of the newborn nursery at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of parents refusing&lt;/strong&gt; vitamin K shots for their newborns has increased, according to a national study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts said newborns need a dose&lt;/strong&gt; of vitamin K after they are born to help their blood clot and prevent a rare but potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As mistrust of the medical field &lt;/strong&gt;has grown in recent years and social media provides  a flood of misinformation, doctors worry it is causing parents to question even routine treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year, there were more refusers than I had ever seen," she said. "We are seeing the repercussions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Heather Levin, an obstetrician/gynecologist who specializes in maternal fetal medicine at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, said she has also seen "the rates of refusal" increase over the last few years. She said parents are getting information from social media and questioning standard practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to have those conversations with them and for people to make informed choices, but there is also a lot of misinformation out there," Levin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though giving a shot of vitamin K — which is not a vaccine — has been a routine procedure at birth for decades, both doctors and vaccine skeptics attributed the drop to growing distrust with established medical practices and health policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the decline in vitamin K uptake and the growth in the number of people skeptical of claims made about vaccine safety are symptoms of the same issue: plummeting confidence in the truthfulness and accuracy of what we are told by health authorities," John Gilmore, of Long Beach, who heads the Autism Action Network and is a vocal critic of vaccine policies, told Newsday in an email. He pointed to COVID-19 guidance and the prescription opioid epidemic in particular as turning points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical associations and prominent physician groups &lt;a class="nd-link" href="/news/nation/childhood-vaccine-schedule-trump-rfk-hhs-p12647"&gt;have been alarmed&lt;/a&gt; by guidance coming out of the federal government and Trump administration regarding vaccine use, despite decades of evidence about their safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies are born deficient of vitamin K, which helps blood clot. This means a small bruise or cut can lead to abnormal bleeding, according to the NIH. Doctors are most concerned about a rare but deadly condition known as &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/about/index.html"&gt;vitamin K deficiency bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, or VKDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They use up whatever clotting factors they were born with pretty quickly to heal after birth," Foy said. "Then they need something else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants who develop VKDB can experience the bleeding internally and on the brain, which can lead to permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest fear, medically, is spontaneous intracranial hemorrhaging," Levin said. "And I don't know if anybody knows why they happen, but vitamin K deficiency is associated with them. This is where you can see prevention of morbidity and mortality for newborns.&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children receive the dose shortly after birth, as part of a regimen that includes other procedures, like putting an antibiotic ointment on the child’s eyes to prevent infection. It's been routinely administered since 1961, when the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC also &lt;a class="nd-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/fact-sheet/index.html"&gt;recommends the shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to accurately diagnose VKDB at birth, so doctors give the shot preventively, said Dr. Erika Banks, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Langone — Long Island. "If they are the unlucky few that have it, they are at risk for life-threatening bleeding into the brain and the bowel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We give it to all babies because it's just a vitamin," Banks said. "It doesn't do any harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is an oral dose available, injection is the most effective way to get vitamin K into a newborn, doctors said, since they don’t absorb it well at that age. Once they are old enough to eat solid foods, they can get vitamin K naturally through leafy vegetables and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York State requires infants to get the vitamin K shot at birth but does not track administration or refusals, state health officials said Thursday. Some hospitals require parents who refuse the treatment to sign a consent form after having a consultation with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are pushing back with interventions in general and vitamin K, unfortunately, is one of them," Foy said. "And I think people are getting trapped to different algorithms on social media and not seeing both sides." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1392886/"&gt;A 1992 study&lt;/a&gt; out of England that looked at 195 children with cancer and 558 without suggested a link between vitamin K shots given to newborns and an increased risk of leukemia. Numerous follow-up studies concluded otherwise, including one from &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2394315/"&gt;United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study Investigators&lt;/a&gt;, that looked at 2,530 children diagnosed with cancer and 4,487 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no convincing evidence that neonatal vitamin K administration, irrespective of the route by which it is given, influences the risk of children developing leukemia or any other cancer," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that questioning is an excellent thing," Banks said, "We never mind being questioned. I think what is concerning is a rising lack of trust of medical expertise on this because these practices save babies' and mothers' lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

			&lt;p&gt;A subtle change in brain wave activity could predict  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188866" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease more than two years before diagnosis, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signal could prove to be a sensitive biomarker of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a noninvasive imaging technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography"&gt;magnetoencephalography&lt;/a&gt; (MEG), neuroscientists at Brown University in the US and Spain's Complutense University of Madrid and &lt;span&gt;University of La Laguna&lt;/span&gt; analyzed the resting brain wave activity of 85 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered distinct differences in the brain wave patterns of participants who went on to later develop Alzheimer's disease. This group produced beta waves at a lower rate, with weaker power, and with a shorter duration than those who did not progress to Alzheimer's within the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;There's One Critical Thing You Can Do to Keep Alzheimer's Symptoms at Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've detected a pattern in electrical signals of brain activity that predicts which patients are most likely to develop the disease within two and a half years," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-08-01/alzheimers-biomarker"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-lead author and neuroscientist Stephanie Jones from Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being able to noninvasively observe a new early marker of Alzheimer's disease progression in the brain for the first time is a very exciting step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns are consistent with a critical shift in beta-wave activity that typically occurs around age 60 in healthy patients. From this point on, these bursts of activity tend to decline, but those with Alzheimer's typically show a faster progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07202-7"&gt;MEG imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked tiny &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-waves-can-be-manipulated-while-we-dream-and-it-could-help-treat-dementia"&gt;brain wave changes&lt;/a&gt; to learning, memory, and executive function, supporting the use of the technique "as a biomarker of cognitive impairment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all depends on how the MEG readings are, well, read. They're often analyzed as averages, but this technique can skip over critical detail, argue the researchers behind the new study. They've&lt;span&gt; instead used a closer analytical technique.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta-wave bursts were ultimately shorter in those who went on to develop Alzheimer's. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.03.010"&gt;Some evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that beta-wave bursts throughout the brain are a signature of inhibitory control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, therefore, suspect that the ability to modulate beta-wave bursts according to the cognitive task at hand is necessary for optimal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associated cognitive decline they observed in those who went on to develop Alzheimer's "may be directly related to lack of inhibitory cognitive control," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/IMAG.a.69"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunch aligns with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf443"&gt;leading hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that suggests Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages is marked by hyperexcitable neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we've uncovered beta event features that predict Alzheimer's disease progression, our next step is to study the mechanisms of generation using computational neural modeling tools," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-08-01/alzheimers-biomarker"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can recreate what's going wrong in the brain to generate that signal, then we can work with our collaborators to test therapeutics that might be able to correct the problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/IMAG.a.69"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DENVER — Colorado health officials have reported the second flu-related death of a child of the 2025-2026 season. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the patient was a high school-aged child from outside metro Denver. CDPHE said the child died in December, and their death was confirmed to be flu-related last week. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, CDPHE &lt;a href="/article/news/health/colorado-flu-child-death/73-b9b4197c-9fb5-4833-8459-ddde65655171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reported the first child death of the flu season&lt;/a&gt;. The agency said the child was elementary school-aged and was from the metro area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says Colorado has one of the highest levels of flu activity in the country, placing the state in the "very high" category for the week ending on Jan. 3.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hospitalizations are down after reaching a peak in December. &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDPHE reports on its website&lt;/a&gt; that there were 406 flu-related hospitalizations during the week ending on Jan. 10. There were 846 hospitalizations for the week ending on Dec. 27.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 3,687 flu-related hospital admissions since Oct. 1, 2025, according to state data. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

By the time he made it to the hospital, it took doctors 10 days to diagnose him. In the meantime, he fell into a coma, suffered heart failure, his lungs filled with fluid, and his brain became inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I was on the other side, with one foot in the other world," he told &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/mosquito-bites-kill-thousands-yearly-dengue-malaria-zika-west-nile-virus/a-75090964" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deutsche Welle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Deutsche Welle&lt;/a&gt;, which summarized his experience with West Nile virus, a disease that can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is West Nile virus concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While most people who contract West Nile virus may never know it, one in five will experience body aches and other flu-like symptoms, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10939-west-nile-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Others, like Hancock, suffer much more worrisome outcomes. Each year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html#:~:text=Did%20you%20know?,more%20than%20130%20people%20die." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1,300;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;1,300&lt;/a&gt; Americans who have contracted West Nile develop severe illness that affects the central nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 130 of those end up dying, the agency adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, cases of West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, and Zika are increasing, as rising global temperatures help mosquitoes to move into new territories and lengthen their active seasons. Many U.S. localities experienced surges in West Nile virus this year: Bell County in Texas reported six positive tests in six weeks, a spike in cases in one part of Utah led to one death, and the number of cases reported across the country in September was 40% higher than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about mosquito-borne diseases?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the most important things that anyone can do to avoid getting sick is to prevent mosquito bites. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellants; wearing long, loose-fitting clothing when you're outside and treating it with permethrin; and taking measures to control mosquitoes inside and outside the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many agencies assist with mosquito control efforts by spraying throughout local communities when needed. Some cities and counties are taking a more creative approach to mosquito control, too. For instance, one Florida county is using X-rays to sterilize male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This species can carry a number of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get TCD's &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/newsletter/?utm_source=recbR9XvfwhgVByh5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletters&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/rewards-club" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rewards Club;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Rewards Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNV05VX1pOM2d3OHd6S3FBVmZ0X1AyME8xZHdqM3hNbzF5bS1NMHRaNm9ZcEhZTHBSbV9GbHJGNE9OOFQ1SnMzY25Va2FHYXBTWFZmc08tQVpMdEU0V0x0OWRKMXZVN3FEVUFRUjBGYnVmME9oQ3NtTnBKU09zT08weVU1dw</guid></item><item><title>斯诺霍米什县宣布麻疹爆发，当地3名儿童检测呈阳性- KOMO</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/measles-outbreak-declared-in-snohomish-county-as-3-local-children-test-positive-outbreak-pandemic-vaccine-child-elementary-deadly-risk-tracking</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;EVERETT, Wash. — &lt;/span&gt;The Snohomish County Health Department has confirmed three new cases of measles in local children, prompting officials to declare an outbreak as the disease spreads within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the unvaccinated children were exposed to a contagious family visiting from South Carolina and tested positive on Jan. 14 after developing fever, cough, and a rash consistent with measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department notified the district on Wednesday of confirmed student cases at Serene Lake Elementary School and Pathfinder Kindergarten Center. Both schools will be closedon  Thursday, Jan. 16, to allow officials time to coordinate next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials warned that measles can spread before symptoms appear and before a rash develops. The virus can also remain in the air for up to two hours after an infectious person leaves an area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snohomish County Health Department said the infected children were at the following public locations before being diagnosed. Anyone at these locations during the listed times may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan. 9, 8:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m. — Pathfinder Kindergarten Center, 11401 Beverly Park Road, Everett&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan. 9, 8:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m. — Serene Lake Elementary School, 9401 Sharon Drive, Everett&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan. 13, 1:10–3:10 p.m. — Swedish Mill Creek Campus medical facility, 13020 Meridian Ave. S., Everett&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times include two hours after the children were at each location, when the virus may have remained airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting more measles cases,” Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. James Lewis said. “There are likely more cases in the community that we do not know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said they were notified last week, along with Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, that three members of the South Carolina family were infectious while visiting King and Snohomish counties from Dec. 27 through Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged families to monitor for symptoms and contact a health care provider with concerns. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious complications, including brain swelling and death in rare cases, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information is available through the &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/460/Measles" target="_blank"&gt;Snohomish County Health Department.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snohomish County Health Department has confirmed three new cases of measles in local children, prompting officials to declare an outbreak after determining the disease is now spreading within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the children were exposed to a contagious family visiting from South Carolina and tested positive for the virus on Jan. 14 after experiencing fever, cough, and a rash consistent with measles.

District officials said both schools will be closed Thursday, Jan. 16, to allow time to coordinate next steps with public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting more measles cases as a result of the previous exposures as well as these new outbreak cases,” Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. James Lewis said. “We are hoping to contain it, but unfortunately, there have been a number of exposure sites already, and there are likely more cases in the community that we do not know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said they were notified last week, along with Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, that three members of the South Carolina family, one adult and two children, were infectious with measles while visiting King and Snohomish counties from Dec. 27, 2025, through Jan. 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, officials said, the family visited multiple locations in Everett, Marysville, and Mukilteo, traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and visited a car rental facility near the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged families and staff to monitor for measles symptoms and contact a health care provider with any health-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re concerned about the health and safety of our Snohomish County children,” Health Department Director Kim Van Pelt said. “Measles is a serious disease that often brings unpleasant symptoms and, in rare cases, swelling of the brain and even death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a confirmed case of measles is identified, the Snohomish Health Department requires proof of immunity for all staff, students, and visitors to affected school buildings, according to the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptable proof of immunity includes documentation showing a birth date before 1957; records verifying two doses of a live measles-containing vaccine administered by a licensed health care provider; a signed letter from a licensed health care provider confirming previous measles infection and recovery; or laboratory evidence, such as a blood test or serology, demonstrating measles immunity, according to the Snohomish County Health Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about measles symptoms is available through the &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/460/Measles" target="_blank"&gt;Snohomish Health Department.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:52:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgJBVV95cUxOcWl5aDdwbGJxRG1wVmtjNkVXZmhCNkMzNzVpdUF3TldTNk42S0RmY1JLS2tWVW0xcVZJYklTNWZVYjVXMzhnY0MzUGJWdW1EZUU2ZGd5d2tGZnI1VTV1NzhZR3BHMzRQcHZIZ0tsQWJwdFAzNlZvVVlCbjBBUVlzbHNpanlmUGQ4Y21oY2laSzNwTEY1SXVScDlvMW5SU1kzSFpiUDQ0am1TT2hHYzZRV2ROMWhlS0NaWE12bDVaNlFDS3FVVGVsc3luNUgycFAyWXpOZkYtSUpzRG5PRkxyTVpkY05TM2FKSTFkOFU1LUNEM2NfTXZLZ2g2QnhKVjBxcVhsVnBR</guid></item><item><title>“寡妇制造者”心脏病发作幸存者谈论警告信号- WAVY.com</title><link>https://www.wavy.com/news/health/widowmaker-heart-attack-survivor-talks-warning-signs/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young Virginia child died from complications associated with the flu, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the first pediatric flu death of the 2025-2026 flu season in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The child who died was "preschool-age," between infancy and 4 years old, the VDH said. The health agency is not sharing more information about the child or their family to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We at the Virginia Department of Health are broken hearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time," Dr. Karen Shelton, the state health commissioner, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death," Shelton continued. "I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;What to know about the 2025-2026 flu season&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu has been trending down in Virginia in recent weeks, the VDH says, but the level of respiratory illness in the commonwealth is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virginia is still reporting emergency room visit surges for the flu, and the VDH says flu outbreaks have "significantly impacted" childcare facilities and schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Jan. 3 — the most recent estimates available as of Jan. 15 — say only around 44% of adults nationwide reported getting their flu vaccine this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only around 43% of children nationwide are estimated to have received a flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Virginia, the numbers are even lower, with less than 30% of eligible residents reporting receiving a flu vaccine this season according to the VDH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal target, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is to have &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/increase-proportion-people-who-get-flu-vaccine-every-year-iid-09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;70% of people in the U.S. over 6 months old&lt;/a&gt; vaccinated against the flu. It's a goal the U.S. consistently falls short of achieving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024-2025 flu season was the deadliest on record for U.S. children, the VDH said. Approximately half of children who died from the flu did not have an underlying medical condition and 89% of them were not up to date on their recommended flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;Is this year's flu virus more severe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flu season, a new subclade of the typical influenza virus A(H3N2), also known as "&lt;a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/new-variant-could-bring-another-severe-flu-season-heres-what-to-know/4023517/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/new-variant-could-bring-another-severe-flu-season-heres-what-to-know/4023517/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;," has been spreading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a highly contagious strain of flu, and a different variation of the flu than the one focused on in this season's vaccine, which is why it became so widespread in several countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this season's flu vaccine will still protect against severe illness that could lead to hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also still other strains of the flu that are circulating beside subclade K, and this season's vaccine will protect against those variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VDH says it is not too late in the season to get your flu vaccine, and can especially help people at higher risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/what-to-know-about-the-flu-vaccine-as-cases-surge/4038802/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/health/what-to-know-about-the-flu-vaccine-as-cases-surge/4038802/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learn more about the flu vaccine here&lt;/a&gt; if you're hesitant to get your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ways to prevent the flu include washing your hands often with soap and water, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow, and staying home when you feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Waiting for the midterms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pharmaceutical executives don’t appear comforted by the pushback. “Today it may be childhood vaccines or mRNA, but tomorrow it’s everything,” Noubar Afeyan, co-founder and chairman of Moderna, maker of mRNA vaccines, said. “We have to say not just ‘why is this happening?,’ but ‘Where will it stop?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bad flu season is underway, Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the anti-vaccine rhetoric is hitting seasonal flu shots. “With the pressure on vaccination, I cannot foresee flu vaccination increasing in this country over the next three years,” he said in a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson had a similarly pessimistic outlook. “It’s clear this administration has a particular sensitivity around vaccination, and indeed pediatric vaccination,” Hudson said. “I’m asked all the time ‘what are you going to do to fix this?,’ and the truth is we just need to stay extremely objective and continue presenting the evidence. There’s really very little else we can do,” except wait for the midterm elections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will have to maintain a steely focus on the long-term future of vaccines and deal with any uncertainty around vaccine coverage rates in the short-term based on misinformation, Facebook posts, and statements from the top,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bourla also worried about the conditions Kennedy is creating to attack drug makers. Kennedy, who is an environmental lawyer with no scientific or medical background, has profited from lawsuits against vaccine makers, as have many of his allies and advisors. “There is also a lot of plaintiffs’ playbook there,” Bourla said. “Everybody will start litigating.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Flu season has taken a grim turn in Virginia, as the state’s health department has reported the first death of a child caused by complications associated with influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to protect the family’s privacy, the only information the Virginia Department of Health is releasing about the child is that they were age 4 or younger and that the death was reported in the eastern region of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We at the Virginia Department of Health, are broken hearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time,” State Health Commissioner Karen Shelton &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/public-relations-contacts/2026-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-report-the-first-pediatric-flu-death-of-the-2025-2026-season/?utm_campaign=20260115_&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death. I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa Sollot, respiratory disease program coordinator with the state health department, told WTOP it’s not too late to get the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year, we were afforded a few extra weeks because activity started so late that I think it may have given us a little extra time for those who are may be procrastinating getting the vaccine,” she said. “We know that activity could start increasing at any minute, and so we know that there’s a lot ahead of us in terms of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do recommend the flu vaccine as the best way to protect yourself and others,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sollot said it’s also important to take precautions, such as staying home when sick, avoiding others when they’re sick, cleaning high-tough surfaces and washing your hands frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since COVID-19 came into the picture, Sollot said flu season has become a bit more unpredictable and it’s important for people to remain vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Typically, activity starts in about October, maybe November. And this year, we really didn’t have activity start until about December. And then it climbed rapidly, almost reaching last year’s peak, before also declining quickly, which is strange activity that we haven’t seen in the past,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has also made us think that this is not necessarily a true decline, and that it is possible that we could see activity surge again in the future, which is why these prevention tips are so important to help protect yourself and your family,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, less than 30% of eligible Virginians reported receiving a flu vaccine this season. Those interested in getting a flu shot can &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/provider-locator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;locate providers on the department’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state health department said the level of respiratory illnesses are considered “moderate” — where over 18.6% of emergency department visits can be attributed to the viral illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last season was the deadliest flu season on record for children in the U.S., according to health officials in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b"&gt;measles infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/334c8b4fcb5df44b25a058c724226d74"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-wastewater-climate-and-environment-8df014e9b38a70606c04234492bb3fb4"&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/wastewater-mpox-covid-cdc-66a91045c9ea10924133506ff090d285"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-8857e56c7b91d82613042beaba169a31"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;national wastewater surveillance system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/pdf/CDC_Wastewater_Surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$125 million a year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to about &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2026/fy-2026-cdc-cj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$25 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Peggy Honein, director of the CDC’s division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would “sustain some of the most critical activities” but “it would likely require some prioritization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six “centers for excellence” — Colorado among them — that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;States brace for cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/house-democrats-republicans-vote-health-care-subsidies-7d69148c6619a190f8d4abb85a7344b8"&gt;pushing back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against cuts to health care in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado’s wastewater surveillance unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that there are other states that haven’t been as fortunate as us,” Wheeler said. “They need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles found in wastewater before patients are diagnosed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/75/wr/mm7502a2.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7502a2_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/75/wr/pdfs/mm7502a1-H.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, researchers used preserved sewage samples from late 2024 to determine if sewage testing could have discovered a burgeoning outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-case outbreak spanned two counties and hit a close-knit community that does not readily seek health care, the study’s authors wrote. The first case was confirmed on July 11 and it ultimately took health officials 15 weeks to stop the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that we were missing cases, and I think that’s always the case in measles outbreaks,” said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. “But this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State see value in sewage tracking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states, such as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state’s system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutton, of Oregon, said she’s hopeful federal leaders will see the power of the system, its adaptability, affordability and reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread use of wastewater surveillance in the United States is one of the greatest advancements in communicable disease surveillance in a generation,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
