And in fact: “Carbs aren’t the enemy—they’re a key player in thriving through midlife,” says &lt;a href="https://www.respin.health/coaches" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.respin.health/coaches" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jessica Corwin, M.P.H., R.D.N." data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Jessica Corwin, M.P.H., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and menopausal health coach at Respin Health. Instead, experts including Dr. Chiang suggest focusing more on complex, fiber-rich sources of the macro, like vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fruits, and reducing refined sugars (like those found in packaged desserts) and ultra-processed carbohydrate sources (like those found in chips and fast food).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="myth-1-sugar-isnt-a-carb" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;With that in mind, here are some common misconceptions around carbs and sugar to have on your radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="7" data-lazy-id="P0-14"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #1: Sugar isn’t a carb." data-anchor-id="myth-1-sugar-isnt-a-carb" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #1: Sugar isn’t a carb.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p id="sugar-is-a-carb-but-not-all-carbs-are-sugar-and-not-all-carbs-or-sugars-are-bad-says-tk" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sugar is a carb, but not all carbs are sugar, says Corwin. Sugar is actually one of three types of carbohydrates, which also include starch and fiber, Corwin explains. “Sugar is the simplest form—think table sugar, honey, or the natural sugars in fruit (fructose) or dairy (lactose),” she adds. “But complex carbs like quinoa or black beans? Those are in the same family, just with more fiber, protein, and staying power.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Simple sugar is the easiest to over-consume because it’s not satiating and has the least nutritional value. It quickly spikes blood sugar, whereas fiber and starch, also known as complex carbs, are broken down with a more gentle and steady blood sugar release that provides the body with more energy for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“I like to incorporate sugar when it helps you to make whole foods more palatable,” says Corwin. “Perhaps a drizzle of a balsamic glaze over roasted vegetables, a spoonful of pure maple syrup over acorn squash, chocolate hummus with strawberries or cucumber, or even a drizzle of honey in green tea,” she says. Just be mindful of your overall total. “The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommends" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; we keep the total to six teaspoons (24 grams) or less per day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="11" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #2: The sugar in fruit and candy get processed in the same way." data-anchor-id="myth-2-the-sugar-in-fruit-and-candy-get-processed-in-the-same-way" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #2: The sugar in fruit and candy get processed in the same way.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The belief here is that natural sugars and added sugars are one and the same, which isn’t necessarily true. “The sugar in fruit comes packaged with fiber, antioxidants, and water, which helps slow absorption and supports metabolic health,” says Dr. Chiang. “It’s a very different scenario from drinking a sugary beverage or eating candy.” Fiber from foods with natural sugars like fruit can also help maintain digestive regularity, lower cholesterol, and promote satiety, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="13" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #3: Artificial sweeteners are worse than added sugar." data-anchor-id="myth-3-artificial-sweeteners-are-worse-than-added-sugar" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #3: Artificial sweeteners are worse than added sugar.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The data is still evolving, and some &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60672537/artificial-sweeteners-may-damage-gut-health-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60672537/artificial-sweeteners-may-damage-gut-health-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="potential health risks" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;potential health risks&lt;/a&gt; related to the overuse of artificial sweeteners have surfaced. But, moderate use of some low-calorie sweeteners may be helpful for people trying to reduce their added sugar intake, especially if they’re managing insulin resistance or prediabetes, says Dr. Chiang. “It really depends on the individual’s overall diet and response,” she concludes, which means it’s &lt;strong data-node-id="14.3"&gt;best to talk to your doctor before upping your artificial sweetener intake if you have one of these conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="15" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #4: Your body needs sugar for energy." data-anchor-id="myth-4-your-body-needs-sugar-for-energy" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #4: Your body needs sugar for energy.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Yes, glucose is technically the body’s preferred energy source, explains Corwin, but you don’t need to get it in its simplest form, especially because those quick hits are just that, quick, and won’t sustain you for very long. “Your body can get glucose from a range of healthy carbs like fruit, beans, and grains,” Corwin says. “Balanced meals with fiber and protein keep your energy more stable than a sugar hit ever could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="17" data-lazy-id="P0-18"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #5: You should eliminate sugar completely during menopause." data-anchor-id="myth-5-you-should-eliminate-sugar-completely-during-menopause" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #5: You should eliminate sugar completely during menopause.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s true that when estrogen declines during menopause, insulin sensitivity becomes a concern, Corwin reiterates. “Yet this all-or-nothing thinking is the real problem,” she says. “Total elimination usually leads to craving and eventual overdoing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="19" class="body-h4 css-12fmbeu emevuu60"&gt;“A little sugar in a nutrient-rich context can absolutely fit in a balanced plan.” &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Corwin recommends trying dark chocolate with almonds or honey in oats when cravings strike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="21" data-lazy-id="P0-19"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #6: Eating low-carb is the best strategy during perimenopause and post-menopause." data-anchor-id="myth-6-eating-low-carb-is-the-best-strategy-during-perimenopause-and-post-menopause" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #6: Eating low-carb is the best strategy during perimenopause and post-menopause.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“While some people do well with reduced-carb patterns, others may not,” says Dr. Chiang. “Carbohydrates, especially those from whole plant sources, can still be part of a balanced, nourishing diet in menopause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Overeating any food can lead to weight gain, not just carbs,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D." data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Charleston-based registered dietitian. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="24" class="body-h4 css-12fmbeu emevuu60"&gt;“Carbs are an essential energy source, and choosing nutrient-dense options like whole grains and fruit can actually support a healthy weight.”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Complex carbs are also contributors to other aspects of health, such as supporting your gut microbiome, keeping the stress hormone cortisol in check, and helping to produce serotonin for mood and melatonin for sleep, Corwin says. So, instead of cutting carbs, she recommends focusing on quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="26" data-lazy-id="P0-20"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #7: Protein is more important than carbs." data-anchor-id="myth-7-protein-is-more-important-than-carbs" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #7: Protein is more important than carbs.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Both are important,” emphasizes Manaker. “Protein helps with muscle repair and satiety, while carbs are your body’s primary energy source.

He claims to be Dominant, but he’s really not. He says that he prefers women who are petite and flat-chested. He also talks a lot about how much he loves to give oral sex to women, and he wants his women to be willing to swing with him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme8n1kz7000p3b78419wu60j@published"&gt;I have been with him for six years, and I can’t give him any of that! It makes me wonder why he’s even with me. We recently had a brief breakup, and he told me he would give all that stuff up if he could be with me, but I am doubtful. I don’t really trust that he has much self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to do some of it, but I have matured and changed, and would prefer to have a relatively normal, heterosexual relationship. He says he’s OK with such a relationship, but I don’t know if I’m OK with being such a huge disappointment to him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme8n1l98000u3b78j2tdcyk6@published"&gt;If you’re in an open relationship, is it possible that he feels significantly fulfilled by you in several ways and is looking for partners who fulfill the roles you aren’t interested in? And, if he set this up during your break, could it be in some part a reaction to the breakup? Most importantly, though, you’re going to have to ask your boyfriend what his motivations and goals were and &lt;em&gt;be able to believe him when he responds&lt;/em&gt;. That’s going to be the biggest factor in whether the two of you can have a healthy relationship—whether you’re able to trust and speak openly with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

Talk it over with some trusted friends who’ve seen the two of you together but who aren’t mutuals. If your family has met him, check in with them about their opinions (omitting the sex aspects as needed).&lt;/p&gt;

I am also asexual. I’m living with an allosexual cisgender man, and I quite like him. However, sexual intercourse between us gets awkward, for lack of a better term. I’m happy to put out to please him, but something is lacking in our sex life, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/01/arranging-hookup-partner-advice.html"&gt;and he seems frustrated by his inability to bring me to orgasm.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message from the director, Susan Monarez, however, was delivered during an all-hands meeting that was brief and chaotic — it was expected to last one hour but closed after 13 minutes — leaving some agency employees marveling at what they saw as the inadequacy of the effort. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a mess,” one wrote to STAT. The meeting began late, and technical problems reportedly prevented some people from joining the call. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though staff were told Jim O’Neill, deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, was on the call, O’Neill did not speak during the meeting. Likewise, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/12/kennedy-hhs-multiple-issues-rising-anxiety/"&gt;many on staff blame for inciting anger against the agency&lt;/a&gt; because of his criticism of vaccines and denigration of public health workers before he took the reins at HHS — was not present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy toured the campus on Monday, a day staff were told to work from home. He has been criticized for posting &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1954188966367723917" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;photos of a salmon fishing outing&lt;/a&gt; in Alaska to his personal social media account on X on Saturday, before &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1955042536680001704" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;he expressed condolences&lt;/a&gt; for the police officer who was killed in Friday’s attack and concern for the CDC staff on his professional X account.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/12/cdc-shooting-staff-concerns-security-rhetoric-rfk-jr/"&gt;A series of CDC meetings were held Monday&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the attack and security concerns. But the meeting on Tuesday was the first agency-wide address to the CDC by Monarez, whose first week at the CDC was punctuated by the attack. She told staff that the CDC Foundation has begun a fundraising effort for the family of the officer who was killed, David Rose of the DeKalb County Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her brief remarks, Monarez alluded to the political debates that have made the once-storied CDC an object of hatred and distrust for some in the country, calling the incident “an attack on our community … and in many ways the very mission we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that misinformation can be dangerous,” she said. “Not only to health, but those that trust us and those we want to trust. And we need to rebuild that trust together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In moments like this, we must meet the challenges with rational evidence-based discourse spoken with compassion and understanding. That is how we will lead,” Monarez said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC’s acting chief operating officer, Christa Capozzola, was supposed to address the meeting but was unable to do so because of technical issues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The event did not give agency employees an opportunity to vent anger or frustrations. A CDC source told STAT the chat function on the platform used to broadcast the meeting had been disabled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gunman who reportedly blamed a Covid vaccination for chronic health problems fired 180 rounds of ammunition at the CDC from a pharmacy across the street. Jeff Williams, director of the CDC’s office of safety, security, and asset management, told staff the shooter struck six different buildings on the campus with at least 150 bullets, shattering windows and terrifying employees. Those employees were forced to shelter in place for hours Friday night as security swept every room on the sprawling campus to determine if the gunman was acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gunman, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot, has been identified as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old from Kennesaw, an Atlanta suburb about 25 miles northwest of CDC headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some CDC staff have told STAT they did not receive the agency’s security alert on Friday and only learned of the incident because of a blaring siren emanating from nearby Emory University, or an email alert that Emory distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/09/cdc-gunman-security-disinformation-rfk-jr/"&gt;In a call on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; with the staff of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases — the group where CDC’s vaccines research and policy is housed — a number of employees expressed concern about how the response was conducted and their general safety. One woman, fighting back tears, suggested she and her colleagues felt like “sitting ducks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The all-hands meeting had been scheduled before Friday’s attack and was to be an opportunity for Monarez to introduce herself and her vision for the agency to the CDC. “This is not the all-staff meeting I wanted to have,” she acknowledged as she opened her remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In 2021, the recommended age to start colorectal cancer screening in the US – either by colonoscopy or at-home testing – was &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-highlights/colon-and-rectal-cancer-research-highlights/screening---early-detection-colorectal-cancer-studies/people-45-49-not-getting-screened-for-colorectal-cancer.html#:~:text=The%20decision%20was%20based%20on,colorectal%20cancer%20at%20age%2045." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lowered&lt;/a&gt; from 50 to 45. In the UK, screening is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/bowel-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; offered starting at age 52, and will soon be offered to those aged 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f85087ed-ef3d-42cf-a0bf-c9fc7a37a672" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"When do you know when it’s time to stop cancer treatment?

But &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-highlights/colon-and-rectal-cancer-research-highlights/screening---early-detection-colorectal-cancer-studies/people-45-49-not-getting-screened-for-colorectal-cancer.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fewer&lt;/a&gt; than 20% of those aged 45 to 49 are keeping up with screenings, &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/colorectal_cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; with 72% of those aged 50 to 75. Experts say some people don’t know they should be getting screened, and others are nervous about what colonoscopies entail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about colonoscopies and colorectal cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-colonoscopy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a colonoscopy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A colonoscopy is an endoscopic procedure, meaning we use a camera at the end of a long tube to examine the colon and rectum,” explains Foda. The colon itself is about 70cm long, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients are first put under sedation or anesthesia. Doctors then insert the scope into their rectum, and examine the lining of the colon for any abnormalities, like masses or small bumps called polyps. These polyps are usually removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The closest analogy is, you have a mole on your skin and it’s growing or discolored, and doctors remove it,” says Michael Sapienza, CEO of the Colorectal &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Alliance, a colorectal cancer advocacy group in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a mass is too big to remove during the colonoscopy, the doctor will take a sample to biopsy and test for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A colonoscopy is an outpatient procedure, meaning you can go home the same day. The procedure itself usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes, but with pre- and post-procedure care, the whole process can last two to three hours, says Dr Andres Carrion, a gastroenterologist at GastroMed Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the most common concerns about colonoscopies is that they are painful, says Carrion. But “intravenous sedatives make the procedure easy, and there is no pain or discomfort”, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-prepare-for-a-colonoscopy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you prepare for a colonoscopy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Colonoscopy preparation starts about a week before the procedure. Patients are instructed to eat a “low residue” diet for that week, which means avoiding foods that can make it difficult for doctors to get a good look at the lining of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These are things that the body takes a while to get rid of, like seeds, nuts, leafy greens and high fiber things,” says Foda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The day before the procedure, patients are restricted to a clear liquid diet – no solid foods. And the night before, they take laxatives to fully clear the colon. This can result in spending quite a bit of time on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hopefully you have some good reading or a movie you can watch on your phone,” says Sapienza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-a-colonoscopy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks of a colonoscopy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Colonoscopies are generally extremely safe, but as with any medical procedure, there are risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-colonoscopies-safe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, these include an adverse reaction to the sedative or anaesthetic used, dehydration from the preparation process, slight bleeding after a polyp is removed or mass biopsied, some abdominal pain, infection and a perforated bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This last risk is serious, but rare. One &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(18)30022-2/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; found that there were four bowel perforations for every 10,000 colonoscopies performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Depending on a person’s health and medical history, doctors may decide that colonoscopies could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those with a first-degree family member – meaning a parent, sibling or child – diagnosed with colorectal cancer, Carrion says screening should start 10 years before the age at which your relative was diagnosed. For example, if your mother was diagnosed with colon cancer when she was 45, you should start getting screened at 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Certain medical histories also put individuals at a higher risk for colorectal cancer, says Foda. This includes those who have previously had cancer and have received chemotherapy, those with inflammatory bowel disease, as well as those with Lynch syndrome (a condition that increases an individual’s risk for many kinds of cancer) and polyposis (a condition characterized by a large number of polyps in the colon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-other-methods-of-colorectal-cancer-screening" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other methods of colorectal cancer screening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Colonoscopies are not the only way to screen for colorectal cancer. For those at an average risk of the disease, there are also non-invasive at-home tests like Cologuard and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), says Sapienza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For both tests, a patient will receive the necessary testing material in the mail or from a doctor. They will then have to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;mail in a personal fecal sample. The FIT analyzes whether there is blood in the stool. The Cologuard test looks for both blood in the stool and abnormal DNA that could point to polyps or masses in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;scriptUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section' &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;format&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;design&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;display&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:4},&amp;quot;elementId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;e57ca313-1ebf-41d3-a061-35650a7e82e0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;isMainMedia&amp;quot;:false}"&gt;&lt;figure id="e57ca313-1ebf-41d3-a061-35650a7e82e0" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section' " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20'Well%20Actually',%20then%20'Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,'%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20'More%20from%20this%20section'%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section' &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-often-should-you-be-screened-for-colorectal-cancer" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often should you be screened for colorectal cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The frequency for each person depends on a number of factors including the type of test performed and medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a colonoscopy is completely clear, you can usually wait 10 years before your next procedure, says Sapienza, but check with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Current guidance recommends that FIT tests be repeated every year, and Cologuard every three years, says Sapienza. If the test is negative, no further analysis is required. If either test comes back positive, you will have to have a colonoscopy.

              &lt;p&gt;An experimental “off-the-shelf” vaccine for recurring pancreatic and colorectal cancer is showing great promise so far. Early results show that the vaccine appears to be safe and is potentially prolonging people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and elsewhere are developing the vaccine, called ELI-002. In Phase I trial data released this week, people who received ELI-002 often developed an immune response to a specific type of cancer-linked mutation and lived longer than expected. The team has since launched a larger Phase II trial of the vaccine platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If this result can be confirmed in large randomized clinical trials, this could be utilized in 90% of pancreatic cancers and 50% of colon cancers who have this mutation,” lead study author Zev Wainberg, co-director of the Gastrointestinal Oncology program at UCLA, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/breast-cancer-vaccine-university-washington-her2-1850100926"&gt;Cancer vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are generally therapeutic, designed to improve our body’s natural ability to stop cancer from returning. ELI-002 is a peptide-based vaccine that tries to train our immune system’s T cells to go after cells containing a mutated KRAS gene. KRAS mutations often fuel the growth of cancerous cells, and they’re commonly found in many solid tumor cancers (up to 25%), particularly pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Unlike vaccines that have to be tuned to a person’s specific cancer, ELI-002 is intended to work against a majority of KRAS-containing cancers right from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In this latest trial, the researchers tested out a version of ELI-002 (ELI-002 2P) on 25 patients: 20 with pancreatic cancer and 5 with colorectal cancer. The patients had undergone standard treatment but continued to have residual cancer cells lingering in their blood, raising the risk of future recurrence. All were given six doses of ELI-002, aimed at their lymph nodes, while half received booster shots as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 85% of people generated an immune response to the two mutated KRAS proteins targeted by the vaccine, with two-thirds having a strong response. 67% of people also developed an immune response to other KRAS proteins, suggesting the vaccine further amplified their immunity to these mutations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, people with pancreatic cancer vaccinated with ELI-002 2P survived for 29 months and lived free of cancer recurrence for 15 months on average—better than the average survival and recurrence-free length historically seen with similar cases, according to the researchers. And those with the strongest immune responses fared even better. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03876-4"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in Nature Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phase I trials aren’t intended to conclusively show that an experimental drug or vaccine works, so the findings should still be viewed with some caution until more data is collected. But it certainly looks like we’re on the verge of a breakthrough with cancer vaccines. Several candidates have shown &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-off-the-shelf-cancer-vaccine-shows-promise-in-early-human-trial-data-2000499098"&gt;similarly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/three-years-after-experimental-vaccine-these-patients-are-still-cancer-free-2000559585"&gt;encouraging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/breast-cancer-vaccine-university-washington-her2-1850100926"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; in human trials, and the first of these newest vaccines could reach the public within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their part, Wainberg and his colleagues have already completed enrollment of a Phase II trial for ELI-002, with results expected in 2026. This trial will test an updated version of the vaccine (named ELI-002 7P) that will hopefully cover an even broader array of KRAS mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Recent generations of AI have proven handy for restaurant recommendations and writing emails, but as a source of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-people-are-risking-medical-advice-from-chatbots-heres-why"&gt;medical advice&lt;/a&gt; they've had some clear drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: a man who followed a chatbot's health plan ended up in hospital after giving himself a rare form of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story began when the patient decided to improve his health by reducing his intake of salt, or sodium chloride. To find a substitute, he did what so many other people do nowadays: he asked ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-ghosts-could-be-a-serious-threat-to-mental-health-expert-warns"&gt;AI 'Ghosts' Could Be a Serious Threat to Mental Health, Expert Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI's chatbot apparently suggested &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bromide"&gt;sodium bromide&lt;/a&gt;, which the man ordered online and incorporated into his diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is true that sodium bromide can be a substitute for sodium chloride, that's usually if you're trying to clean a hot tub, not to make your fries tastier. But the AI neglected to mention this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpt-5-surprising-truths-about-how-ai-chatbots-actually-work"&gt;crucial context&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months later, the patient presented to the emergency department with paranoid delusions, believing his neighbor was trying to poison him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;physicians write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he was treated with anti-psychosis drugs, the man calmed down enough to explain his AI-inspired dietary regime. This information, along with his test results, allowed the medical staff to diagnose him with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromism"&gt;bromism&lt;/a&gt;, a toxic accumulation of bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromide levels are typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jat/22.3.225"&gt;less than around 10 mg/L&lt;/a&gt; in most healthy individuals; this patient's levels were measured at 1,700 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromism was a relatively common condition in the early 20th century, and is estimated to have once been responsible for up to 8 percent of psychiatric admissions. But cases of the condition drastically dropped in the 1970s and 1980s, after medications containing bromides began to be phased out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170999" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper-642x313.png" alt="Man Hospitalized With Psychiatric Symptoms After Following AI Medical Advice" class="wp-image-170999 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper-642x313.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper-600x292.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper.png 739w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170999" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bromide salts were once common, over-the-counter medications.

Some locals in Colorado noted seeing the same rabbits in their neighborhood dating back to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Susan Mansfield told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661"&gt;KUSA&lt;/a&gt;: 'It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth.

consumption damages the cells in the pancreas responsible for producing digestive enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This damage triggers inflammation, harming the organ—which plays a vital role in breaking down food and regulating blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this inflammation can lead to pre-cancerous lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These may progress into pancreatic cancer—a disease that kills more than 9,000 Britons and 50,000 Americans each year and has one of the worst survival rates of any &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-6e05aab0-778b-11f0-8d24-b3ecc5fe3368"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heavy alcohol use is typically defined as eight or more drinks per week for women and 15 or more for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team explained that for the condition to advance to cancer, there must also be a mutation in a gene called Ras, which controls cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In experiments, they found that alcohol combined with a pro-inflammatory molecule caused symptoms similar to alcohol-induced pancreatitis—an inflammatory condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study has revealed the link between alcohol and pancreatic cancer as well as a solution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pancreatic cancer remains one of the least survivable forms of the disease and worryingly its on the rise. Source for data: Cancer Research UK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This process triggered the lesions and ultimately cancer itself, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also discovered they could stop pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions from forming in the pancreas—by disabling a specific gene called CREB, which plays a pro-inflammatory role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found CREB acts like a 'master controller', capable of permanently reprogramming healthy pancreas cells into abnormal, pre-cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This paves the way for pancreatic cancer to develop.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study co-author Dr Nipun Merchant, a surgeon in Miami, said that they believe their findings 'lay the groundwork' for future pancreatic cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery comes amid a troubling rise in pancreatic cancer cases among younger people—although there has not yet been a spike in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has a grim prognosis, with around 10 per cent of patients surviving the first year after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By three years, the survival rate drops to around one per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly types, and kills roughly 90 percent of its victims, and has a survival rate after five years of around two percent or less&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pancreatic cancer has been dubbed a 'silent killer' due to its subtle signs that are often only spotted too late&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fewer than one in 20 pancreatic cancer patients live to see the decade after their diagnosis, according to UK figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, it is incredibly important to catch the illness in its early stages by recognising the easy to dismiss symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain and changes in bowl habits and jaundice—the yellowing of the skin or eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is an umbrella term for various tumours found on the 25cm tadpole shaped organ that helps with digestion and hormone regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common type which is called adenocarcinoma accounts for roughly 90 per cent of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This variant has little-to-no symptoms until patients start suddenly losing weight and turn yellow and at which point for the vast majority, it is too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is for this reason the heartbreaking disease has been dubbed a 'silent killer'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the surge in cases has come from another type of pancreatic cancer, called endocrine cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are slow growing tumours which take decades to emerge, and while they may turn cancerous, are mostly benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts suspect that cancer isn't appearing more often in young people, but there are better tools today to diagnosis it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They put the surge down to an increased use of high-tech medical scans like CT and MRIs which have grown more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Health Service (NHS) those more likely to get cancer are over 65s and those who have chronic pancreatitis or a family history of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other risk factors include smoking, being overweight or obese, diabetes, eating red and processed meat as well as blood group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;With its mild flavor and high water content, zucchini may not seem like a nutritional standout. But this summer fruit (yes, it’s a fruit) can help lower inflammation, support clearer vision and promote metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at all that zucchini has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It contains powerful antioxidants. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, zucchini has been used in traditional medicine because of its anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antimicrobial properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists link these benefits to the antioxidants in zucchini, including vitamin C, beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, which help protect cells from free radical damage and enhance immune function. Half a medium zucchini contains about 15 milligrams of vitamin C, which is nearly 20% of the daily recommended amount for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin are also carotenoids, pigments that give zucchini its bright green skin. Carotenoids can help regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, said Taylor Wallace, a food scientist and adjunct clinical associate professor at George Washington University. Cytokines act as chemical messengers in the immune system, signaling cells to respond to infection or injury. At healthy levels, cytokines keep us from getting sick, but too many or too few can drive excess inflammation and lead to diseases like cancer, Wallace explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dark, leafy greens and berries are richer in carotenoids and other antioxidants, zucchini’s advantage lies in its versatility. It can be prepared in all sorts of ways, and its mild taste makes it an easy filler or substitute ingredient (think “zoodles”) that packs a nutritional punch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zucchini may not be a particularly “glamorous vegetable,” but it’s inexpensive to buy and easy to grow yourself, added Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It’s good for your vision. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutein and zeaxanthin are essential for eye health. They build up in a part of the eye called the macula and help protect eye cells from damage. Over time, these nutrients can help keep vision sharp and stave off age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of zucchini contains a little over 2 milligrams of lutein and zeaxanthin, which is about 17% of what experts recommend daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It can help keep blood pressure in check. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the cells in your body to function properly, two minerals need to stay in balance: potassium and sodium. Unfortunately, “almost no one” gets enough potassium, Wallace said. And almost everyone gets too much sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is key to managing blood pressure and offsetting the effects of too much sodium, said Maya Vadiveloo, a dietitian and associate professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode Island. Half a medium zucchini contains about 4% of the recommended daily amount, which is similar to what you’d find in half a banana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Zucchini fills you up, but it isn’t calorie-dense. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being 95% water, zucchini is low in sugar, calories and fat. Research suggests that energy density — the number of calories per unit of food weight — shapes how much we eat, how satiated we feel and our long-term health. The lower the calories-to-volume ratio, the better. Regularly eating water-rich, lower-energy-density foods can help you feel full and curb the risk of chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bulking up your plate with zucchini or other nonstarchy vegetables is a great way to reduce how much you’re eating without feeling like you’re depriving yourself,” Vadiveloo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What’s the best way to eat zucchini? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any form — raw, grilled, puréed, roasted, sautéed, spiralized — is healthy, experts said, though there are a few things to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t peel zucchini’s verdant skin, because it’s packed with nutrients. Heat can degrade some important compounds, like vitamin C. And the lutein and zeaxanthin in zucchini are fat-soluble, so they’re best absorbed with a little olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, this cancer is diagnosed by specialists using invasive procedures like video nasal endoscopy and biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-voice-could-hide-the-tell-tale-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Your Voice Could Hide The Tell-Tale Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital screening tools that detect the early warning signs of laryngeal cancer using voice recordings could help non-specialist doctors identify patients at risk, and help them receive a diagnosis sooner than they might otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing 12,523 voice recordings from 306 North American participants, researchers from Oregon Health and Science University and Portland State University identified in men the telltale vocal features of vocal fold lesions that were either benign or cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the harmonic-to-noise ratio (the relationship between tone and noise) helped to differentiate between male voices with cancer, benign lesions, and voice disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were unable to find  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="170955" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; identifying features in women's voices in this study, but are hopeful that a wider dataset could offer better results for female voices in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170969" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-170969" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170969" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Laryngeal cancer symptoms include voice changes like hoarseness, and a sore throat that won't go away.

Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions reached a record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These statistics became all the more disturbing last fall when, shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/health/child-vaccinations-decline-cdc.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;286,000 children&lt;/a&gt; began their educations without proof of full immunity against measles, a man who has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/trump-anti-vax.html#:~:text=A%20long%20and%20complicated%20history%20with%20vaccines&amp;amp;text=In%202007%2C%20she%20wrote%2C%20he,happened%20to%20take%20the%20vaccine.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bragged about never getting a flu shot&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected to the presidency.

In doing so, they risk endangering millions of people and kickstarting a doom loop of mistrust from which it could take decades to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As usual, the Trump administration’s stance on vaccines is motivated less by sincere populism and more by personal profit. Before Kennedy launched his own presidential campaign on a platform of “making America healthy again”, he earned &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/03/rfk-jr-maha-pay-vaccine-group-childrens-health-defense/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20,000 every week&lt;/a&gt; helming a non-profit dedicated to fostering vaccine skepticism. Now in the cabinet, he has fired the entire &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-to-fire-all-members-of-the-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-00395235" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC vaccine advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; and replaced them with a ragtag crew, half of whom have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/members-rfk-jr-s-new-vaccine-committee-have-published-little-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;never published peer-reviewed research&lt;/a&gt; on vaccines. Just last week, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/nx-s1-5493550/rfk-jr-funding-mrna-vaccine-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancelled $500m of federal funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/#:~:text=They%20determined%20the%20number%20of,COVID%E2%80%9019%20in%20a%20year." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevented 14m deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the Covid-19 pandemic. And he has made these rollbacks while &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-confirmation-robert-f-kennedy-merck/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retaining a financial stake&lt;/a&gt; in ongoing litigation against a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All the while, the US has seen more than &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1,300 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and three deaths this year. In response, Kennedy has alternately &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; the most effective method of prevention – widespread immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evisceration of funding has extended across the sciences, with Trump cutting support for research to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/upshot/nsf-grants-trump-cuts.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;35-year nadir&lt;/a&gt;. At the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5437295-nih-broke-law-by-withholding-funding-gao/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1,800 grants&lt;/a&gt; have been terminated, a move that the Government Accountability Office &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/us/politics/trump-gao-nih-funding.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deemed illegal&lt;/a&gt;. The administration also continues to freeze grants to universities over culture war phantasms like DEI, including &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-05/ucla-negotiate-nih-nsf-doe-grant-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$339m at UCLA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$2.2bn at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s not surprising that &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/5218404-scientists-poll-leaving-us-poll/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;75% of US scientists&lt;/a&gt; polled by the journal Nature are considering leaving the country, which raises the prospect of a lost generation of American talent and lifesaving innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Internationally, Trump’s heartless and thoughtless budget cuts are causing devastation. The administration &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/usaid-programs-now-run-state-department-agency-ends/story?id=123373289" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has dismantled USAID,&lt;/a&gt; one of the most successful preventers of contagious disease in history. In doing so, it defunded programs that &lt;a href="https://ge.usembassy.gov/usaid-and-vaccines-helping-save-9-3-million-children-in-the-last-10-years/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccinated more than 800 million children&lt;/a&gt; against fatal illnesses like malaria. Researchers have found that &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/news-logos/BU-researcher-warns-of-367,000-deaths-from-halted-USAID-programs_.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;300,000 people have already died&lt;/a&gt; because of these cuts, which could lead to another &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452513/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;14m preventable deaths&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years – all to gut an agency that managed the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usaid-cuts-lead-14-million-deaths-five-years-researchers-say-rcna216095" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; of 4% of &lt;a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_ndaa_conference_executive_summary1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the annual national defense budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Back in the US, medical associations, local officials and individual doctors are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/24/vaccines-access-rfk-cdc/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;collaborating to buy vaccines&lt;/a&gt; directly from manufacturers and lobbying insurance companies to continue covering the costs of those shots. Their efforts reflect a tried-and-true strategy to counter under-immunization. Before the current outbreak, Ronald Reagan-era cuts to public health caused &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/13/722944146/how-public-health-outreach-ended-a-1990s-measles-outbreak-and-whats-different-no" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a more widespread measles pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with 27,000 cases in just 1990. But locally led outreach campaigns and grassroots vaccination programs turned back the crisis, as did an eventual restoration of federal funds under Bill Clinton’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Budget cuts can be reversed, but trust may be more difficult to recover. Long before RFK Jr’s ascendancy, disasters like the CDC’s infamous &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee&lt;/a&gt; and the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.12.1.226" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glacial response to the Aids crisis&lt;/a&gt; cast long shadows over public health institutions. Today, a plurality of Americans &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/poll-many-americans-say-they-will-lose-trust-in-public-health-recommendations-under-federal-leadership-changes/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;are already predicting&lt;/a&gt; they will lose faith in medical guidance under the current administration. That would undermine the very basis of public health, which depends on people choosing to follow guidelines grounded in research they did not personally conduct and whose results they are ill-trained to parse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Repairing that breach will require years of effortful relationship-building, but it might also require rallying Americans with the classic tactic of patriotism. For all of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, he misses that our nation’s most extraordinary scientific and medical advances have drawn bipartisan enthusiasm in part because they reinforced a perceived American exceptionalism. At the height of the cold war, RFK Jr’s uncle &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/we-choose-go-moon-jfks-moon-shot" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chose to go to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, and Richard Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/55-years-ago-president-nixon-establishes-space-task-group-to-chart-post-apollo-plans/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brought that dream to fulfilment&lt;/a&gt;. After Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Americans helped fund it by &lt;a href="https://time.com/5062520/march-of-dimes-history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mailing in more than 2.5m dimes&lt;/a&gt;, hence its christening as the March of Dimes.

      &lt;p&gt;Eleanor Ceres found out she had lung cancer after the tumor spread from her chest and began protruding out her neck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Ceres has been smoking for over 30 years — and smoking causes &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly three-quarters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer deaths around the world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Why wasn't she diagnosed earlier? Prior to the tumor's manifestation, her only symptom had been a sore arm, which the doctors chalked up to arthritis. By the time she was diagnosed in April 2024, the cancer had advanced to Stage 4 and was terminal. Doctors could only offer palliative care, easing her pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've got a child around 12 years old. I want to see her grow up and get married and have her own children," says Ceres, a single mother. "I cry a lot because I'm gonna die and everybody's gonna stay alive."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The story of Ceres holds clues to a puzzling issue involving lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's the deadliest cancer &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the world&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, killing 1.8 million people each year — more than any other cancer. But the official statistics suggest that isn't the case in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, based on mortality rates, it seems that lung cancer is only a problem in South Africa — the &lt;a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/AFQ/DZA/ZAF/MAR/NGA/EGY?year=2019" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;richest country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the region — and, in particular, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782117301637?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Western Cape&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the province with the &lt;a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/state-of-sa-hospitals-western-cape-has-most-efficient-health-care-in-country-but-fears-grow-of-deterioration-5239603c-6698-400c-9d53-44f8ce144dca" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most efficient&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)11820-4/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Western%20Cape%20has%20had,proportion%20than%20any%20other%20province." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;well-resourced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; health care system.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But experts say these statistics hide the real story: how lung cancer is being grossly undercounted across sub-Saharan Africa. While smoking is slightly higher in &lt;a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/lifestyle/top-10-african-countries-that-have-the-most-smokers/dl63tzv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Africa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared to its neighbors, that's only half the story, according to Dr. Coenie Koegelenberg, a pulmonologist at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town. "We have the most accurate stats because we actually diagnose lung cancer," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77205" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Africa's hidden lung cancer epidemic, as Koegelenberg calls it, is part of a larger crisis in global health, as infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV have increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30925-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;come under control&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35458" target="_blank"&gt;Africa's cancer burden, for example, is expected to more than double by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, from 370,000 new cases a year to 940,000 cases. However, &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272534/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.8-eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;only 1%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of global health funding is allocated to preventing and treating NCDs in low- and middle-income countries, despite accounting for two-third of annual deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lung cancer offers a case study for how these countries can succeed or fail in addressing NCDs, given that this disease can usually be prevented through smoking cessation or even &lt;a href="https://press.rsna.org/timssnet/media/pressreleases/14_pr_target.cfm?ID=2380" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cured&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with regular screening and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, systemic undercounting and resource constraints have allowed the disease to grow unchecked across sub-Saharan Africa. "If you don't report things and put your head in the sand, that doesn't mean it's not there," Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why lung cancer goes undiagnosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are almost no nerve endings in the lungs, so in the early stages, the most common symptom of lung cancer is no symptom at all, says Dr. Keertan Dheda, a pulmonologist at Groote Schuur Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when symptoms do appear, they are often quite generic — chest pain, coughing up blood, and difficulty breathing. So, doctors in sub-Saharan Africa often misdiagnose lung cancer patients as having tuberculosis, given the &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis-tb" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high burden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the region, Dheda continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Patients would go through the whole treatment regimen for tuberculosis and not really be investigated for lung cancer," says Lorraine Govender, a nurse and the national manager of health promotion at The Cancer Association of South Africa. Those lost six to nine months of possible treatment can be deadly, since &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/survival" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;55% of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with lung cancer die within a year, according to Cancer Research UK "The lack of training for health care providers to identify lung cancer is a big problem," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis may play an even more direct role, given that patients with this disease are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8836400/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;twice as likely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get lung cancer than those without — likely due to this bacterial disease causing lung inflammation and DNA damage.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;HIV is also implicated in lung cancer since this virus weakens patients' immune systems, leaving them less able to fend off respiratory diseases or kill budding cancer cells, according to Koegelenberg. His own research shows that, among &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27384354/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, those with HIV tend to be younger and have more advanced cancer than those without HIV. "Lung cancer is but one spoke in the wheel of colliding epidemics," Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, many lung cancer patients die misdiagnosed, and their real cause of death is rarely known, given poor infrastructure to certify deaths and their causes. "In Africa, where we don't have the screening and diagnosis available, we may see deaths from cancer but not know what cancer the patient actually died from," Govender says, "or maybe have deaths and not know it was cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Autopsies could help answer these questions but are rarely performed for religious and cultural reasons, says Dr. Kelechi Okonta, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. The World Health Organization thus assessed that &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/whats-cause-certifying-deaths-sub-saharan-africa" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two-thirds of countries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Africa don't have reliable data on births, deaths, and cause of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Okonta thinks sub-Saharan Africa is in a catch-22 on lung cancer, where systemic undercounting leads to limited data and limited data allows governments to ignore this disease and the need for better record-keeping. "There is no intentional activity by any government at any level. There is no lung cancer registry, there is no lung cancer group, there is no lung research grant, there is no lung cancer unit, even in the hospitals," says Okonta. "They think it's not a problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other side of the problem is timely diagnosis. While the Western Cape and South Africa lead the region in spotting lung cancer, for most patients, it comes too late. Data from the largest hospital in the Western Cape showed that, in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9250306/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;94%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of patients with lung cancer had advanced, incurable disease at the time of diagnosis. There's always an ethical dilemma around asking someone with advanced lung cancer to stop smoking, says Dr. Ayanda Trevor Mnguni, head of the department of internal medicine at Khayelitsha District Hospital in South Africa and a pulmonologist. "Once you are actually so far gone, there's really no point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77206" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dr. Ayanda Trevor Mnguni is the head of internal medicine at Khayelitsha District Hospital, where he treats lung cancer patients. He says that the diagnosis almost always comes so late in the progression of the cancer that only palliative care can be offered to relieve pain.

Especially &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4382920/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;at risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are communities like Khayelitsha, a racially segregated township on the outskirts of Cape Town, as tobacco companies often flood poor areas with cheap cigarettes and aggressive marketing. It's a sprawling maze of makeshift homes — of cardboard, wood and corrugated metal — over &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york/manhattan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;twice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sikhulasonke.org.za/about-khayelitsha.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as dense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as Manhattan, with an estimated &lt;a href="https://borgenproject.org/life-inside-worlds-largest-slums/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2.4 million residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At Khayelitsha District Hospital, patients in blue gowns regularly step outside to have a smoke. Mbulelo Shicani, a lung cancer patient here, says that he buys a pack of cigarettes for 10 rand, or 50 cents, and that these prices have actually been &lt;a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/29/Suppl_4/s267.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;coming down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Local shop owners also never turn away customers since they're too young, Shicani continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We obviously diagnose lung cancer a lot better compared to the rest of the country and the rest of the continent," Mnguni says, given that the Western Cape has the strongest health care system in South Africa and perhaps all of sub-Saharan Africa. "But that doesn't mean much if smoking rates continue to rise," he says, and the disease is almost always so advanced that the only option is palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; and lung cancer patients only receive palliative care upon diagnosis" — For those in Khayelitsha, they're almost always facing such advanced disease that "we don't even refer them to the oncologist," Mnguni says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why screening isn't an easy solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to find tumors and treat them early is with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6790462/#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer screening&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially given that &lt;a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/23/2024/africa-big-pharma-push-cancer-early-detection" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as AstraZeneca and Chinese firm BGI Genomics, see Africa as a key region for innovation and investment. So, in 2019, Koegelenberg and Dheda created the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790462/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first lung cancer screening guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa, and Discovery, the largest private health-insurance provider in South Africa, started covering screening several months ago, Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That, however, would only serve South Africa's private health care system, which caters to a small, wealthier minority with far greater resources. Dheda openly acknowledges that lung cancer screening isn't practical for the &lt;a href="https://www.thepresidency.gov.za/node/8149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;84% of South Africans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the public system, or even most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, "although we should be screening and we know we should be screening," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if there were enough CT scanners to screen high-risk individuals, there wouldn't be capacity to biopsy nodules and treat all these cases, given budget shortfalls and rapidly growing waitlists. "It's unethical to do the scan if there's an abnormality, and you actually can't do anything about it," says Dr. Sameera Dalvie, an oncologist at Groote Schuur Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The only option, as Mnguni sees it, is public health awareness with comprehensive anti-smoking campaigns and regulations. He points out that Shicani and most people in Khayelitsha don't know that smoking can lead to lung cancer, so governments shouldn't take awareness for granted. "Once people end up with cancer, unfortunately, you're not going to do well," Mnguni says. "For most limited resource countries, the best bet is to prevent people from getting the disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This too is easier said than done, given &lt;a href="https://www.iol.co.za/ios/news/tobacco-dealers-cry-foul-over-anti-smoking-bill-6c93f37e-ef45-44e7-aa1d-226f68f54f6a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pressure from tobacco companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the need for greater social support to help people manage addiction. "Many people view smoking as a coping mechanism," says Salomé Meyer, one of the leaders of South Africa's Cancer Alliance. "What are you going to offer in the place of smoking when communities are living in stress?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change may be on the way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Meyer is hopeful about the future. South African lawmakers are &lt;a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/824494/new-smoking-laws-for-south-africa/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;considering a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.medicalbrief.co.za/new-smoking-vaping-bill-proposes-20-year-sentences/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new smoking law&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that would ban all tobacco and e-cigarette advertising, as well as raise penalties to 15 years of jail time for businesses that sell tobacco to children or at cut-rate low prices. Furthermore, recent research from Vietnam suggests that lung cancer screening might be feasible with &lt;a href="https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(23)01169-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chest x-rays and artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a more realistic, scalable option for sub-Saharan Africa, Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, change hinges on better data collection, from comprehensive cancer registries to a universal death registration system, Okonta says. And that might have to be proactively driven by the healthcare system instead of the government — in order to break the catch-22. "With adequate record keeping and follow-up of patients, we can solve this," Okonta adds. "Maybe the government will start paying attention to lung cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We must stop hiding behind, 'Oh, it's not going to be affordable,'" Meyer says, since the cost of inaction is far too high. "We must just do it."&lt;/p&gt;

Their findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12024-024-00903-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that dyes like methylene blue and toluidine blue, as well as medications or consumer products containing warning colors, tend to produce distinct discoloration patterns in the body. These color changes may offer clues about medical interventions or substance exposure prior to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study emerged from an autopsy of a 72-year-old man, where the forensic team noticed that some organs began to darken into a striking blue-green hue shortly after exposure to air. This prompted a systematic review of similar cases, both in their own institutional records and in the existing literature, to determine the cause and possible diagnostic relevance of such unusual color changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic pathologists are trained to identify and interpret a wide range of tissue abnormalities. Changes in the color of organs during autopsy are often linked to common causes such as decomposition or bleeding. But in some rare cases, the source of discoloration is not immediately clear. The case that initiated this study involved a rapid and unexpected shift in organ color, specifically in the brain and heart, prompting questions about whether a chemical or pharmaceutical compound might have caused the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that subtle findings—like organ color shifts—can be easy to miss or misinterpret, particularly if they are rare or not well documented. In this case, the absence of obvious decomposition, combined with the pattern of discoloration and the rapid intensification of the color during the procedure, pointed to a more specific etiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore potential causes, the team reviewed a database of over 15,000 autopsy records from their institution, looking for keywords such as “blue-green,” “turquoise,” and “greenish” in descriptions of organ appearances. This search returned eleven relevant cases, including the initial index case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the full autopsy reports for each case and, when possible, reviewed the patients’ hospital records. They also conducted a targeted literature review to identify reports of similar discolorations linked to known drugs or toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the eleven cases, nine involved deaths that occurred in a hospital setting. Medical records were available for most of these patients, allowing the researchers to reconstruct the medical interventions and medications given before death. In six of the hospital cases, methylene blue had been administered intravenously. In two others, toluidine blue had been used. In the remaining cases, the discoloration was likely due to the ingestion of substances containing food-grade dyes or other pigments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue is a synthetic dye that has been used in medicine for over a century. It is commonly employed as a diagnostic stain during surgeries to visualize structures like the urinary tract or gastrointestinal lining. Clinically, it is also used as an antidote for conditions such as methemoglobinemia, where it helps restore the blood’s ability to carry oxygen. In intensive care settings, methylene blue may be given to treat circulatory shock that does not respond to other medications, as it can help improve blood pressure by affecting blood vessel tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toluidine blue, another synthetic dye, is primarily used in medical imaging and tissue staining. It selectively binds to acidic cellular components like DNA and RNA, making it useful for identifying abnormal or precancerous cells during endoscopic examinations or biopsies. Although less commonly used than methylene blue, toluidine blue has similar staining properties and is occasionally employed when methylene blue is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the cases reviewed, a consistent pattern emerged: discoloration tended to affect specific organs depending on the substance involved and the route of exposure. When methylene blue had been administered intravenously, the discoloration was most often seen in the brain and heart. In contrast, oral ingestion of dyes or dyed substances was more likely to produce localized staining in the gastrointestinal tract or urinary bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the original case, the 72-year-old man had received toluidine blue both orally and intravenously during treatment for a perforated duodenal ulcer and subsequent septic shock. After death, the autopsy revealed a rapidly darkening blue-green tint in the brain, heart, and mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another case, a 30-year-old man with severe COVID-19 and necrotizing pancreatitis had received methylene blue as part of his treatment for circulatory shock. Upon autopsy, his brain and heart exhibited the same dark blue-green tint shortly after being exposed to air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar discoloration pattern was seen in other cases where methylene blue had been used, reinforcing the idea that this dye, or its oxidized form, is responsible for the color change. The researchers explained that methylene blue circulates in a reduced form within the body but oxidizes upon contact with atmospheric oxygen after death, intensifying the blue-green appearance during autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to medically administered dyes, the team also identified two cases in which the discoloration could be traced to the ingestion of Rohypnol®, a drug that includes a blue dye to deter misuse. In both cases, the individuals had consumed large quantities of the drug in apparent suicide attempts, and blue-green staining was found in the stomach lining and intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another case involved a woman who had ingested a cleaning product containing Brilliant Blue FCF (a synthetic dye used in food and industrial products). In her case, the urinary bladder lining exhibited the same striking coloration, likely due to excretion of the dye through the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-020-00316-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 case report&lt;/a&gt;, also published in &lt;em&gt;Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, which described a similar discoloration of the brain and heart in a 63-year-old woman who had been treated with methylene blue for septic shock. That report noted a greenish-blue hue in the affected organs, which intensified upon air exposure, consistent with the oxidation of the compound. The authors of that report highlighted the importance of distinguishing such findings from other causes of discoloration, such as decomposition or toxic gas exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study builds on those observations by identifying a larger set of similar cases, offering a clearer understanding of the substances that tend to produce these effects and the specific tissues they affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers were able to associate discoloration patterns with specific xenobiotics, their conclusions were based primarily on visual observations and review of medical records. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, tissue samples were not always available for histological or toxicological confirmation of methylene blue or toluidine blue residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conventional histology, the dyes often degrade or are no longer visible, limiting the ability to confirm their presence postmortem. More sophisticated testing could provide chemical verification, but such analyses were beyond the scope of this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the rarity of systemic toluidine blue administration, which may explain why its effects have not been previously documented in forensic contexts. As this dye is sometimes used as a substitute for methylene blue during shortages, awareness of its potential for postmortem discoloration may become more important in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the authors suggest that forensic teams should consider the possibility of xenobiotic exposure when encountering unexplained blue-green discolorations during autopsy. Integrating clinical history, medication records, and targeted toxicology testing can help avoid unnecessary speculation or misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12024-024-00903-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fifty shades of green and blue: autopsy findings after administration of xenobiotics&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by J.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;Expert Reveals a Drug-Free Way to Mimic The Effects of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171046" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank. This, in turn, decreased the release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png" alt="New Study Hints at Natural Alternative to Ozempic Hiding in The Gut" class="wp-image-149407 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-729x415.png 729w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-768x437.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-1536x875.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-600x342.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of GLP-1 agonist pathway and FGF21 pathway.

From breakfast scrambles to rich desserts, its versatility makes it a culinary favorite. But beyond its taste and texture, new research suggests eggs may also be a powerful ally for your brain health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49736"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Eggs_a_nutritional_powerhouse"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs: a nutritional powerhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutritionally, eggs are hard to beat. A single egg delivers about 70 kilocalories, 7 grams of &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/mug-cake-proteine-chocolat/" data-type="post" data-id="49419"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, healthy fats (saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated), and vitamin D. They are also an excellent source of choline, a nutrient vital for cell function and brain development. Studies have already linked eggs to cardiovascular health, eye protection, and weight management. Surprisingly, despite long-standing myths, recent findings also suggest eggs can help regulate blood cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_the_latest_study_reveals_about_the_brain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the latest study reveals about the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study published by the &lt;strong&gt;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)&lt;/strong&gt; examined data from 890 people, including 531 women, to explore the relationship between egg consumption and cognitive performance. The results were striking: women who ate the most eggs showed slower memory decline, while men who consumed eggs regularly scored better in overall and long-term cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_eggs_may_boost_cognitive_function"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why eggs may boost cognitive function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers point to eggs’ rich content of carotenoids and choline as key factors. These nutrients support the nervous system, enhance neurotransmitter function, and may improve cognitive abilities such as &lt;strong&gt;memory and focus&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the study also noted that certain benefits appeared to differ between men and women, and more research is needed to understand why these variations occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_bottom_line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are more than just a breakfast staple — they may be a &lt;strong&gt;brain-boosting &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/this-is-the-worlds-healthiest-food-according-to-scientists/" data-type="post" data-id="49507"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that supports mental sharpness over time.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which produces them, said it was reviewing its advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NICE recommends that monitoring, using blood tests and scans, should be offered to the lowest risk cases in England and Wales, where nine in 10 will have no signs of cancer spreading within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But research has suggested this could be extended to the next lowest risk group where eight in 10 men will have no signs of cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Evidence gathered by Prostate Cancer UK suggests many hospitals have started offering monitoring to this wider group of patients, but a quarter have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to the analysis of data in England, this appears to have resulted in over-treatments rates of between 2% and 24% across different hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The charity estimates this results in around 5,000 men a year getting treatment they do not always need instead of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some of this could be down to patient choice – men are generally given the option of treatment even if they are at low-risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the charity said if the NHS was more active in offering monitoring it could help strengthen the case for prostate cancer screening, which has gained traction since the diagnosis of Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One argument against screening is that the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/psa-test/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test&lt;/a&gt;, used to spot potential signs of the cancer, is unreliable and leads to unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amy Rylance of Prostate Cancer UK, said: "To reduce the harm caused by prostate cancer and build the foundations for a screening programme, we need to both save lives and prevent unnecessary treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said NICE needed to update its guidance to reflect the emerging evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One patient who opted for monitoring was Michael Lewis, 63, from the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020 and, as it was judged low-risk, he opted for monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Four years later tests suggested the cancer was worsening so he had his prostate removed.

The findings suggest that a person’s resting heart function — specifically high-frequency heart rate variability — might slightly buffer these self-critical perceptions, indicating a potential physiological mechanism that supports social resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is often misunderstood as simply being alone. In reality, it refers to the subjective feeling that one’s social relationships are lacking in quality or quantity. A person can be surrounded by others and still feel lonely if those interactions do not feel meaningful. In contrast, social isolation is an objective state defined by having few social contacts, which may or may not be distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness acts as a psychological alarm, signaling a perceived loss or threat to social connection. This feeling tends to ramp up attention to social cues, especially those signaling rejection or conflict. For some, this heightened sensitivity may help guide reconnection efforts. For others, however, it can spiral into withdrawal and further alienation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although loneliness has been consistently linked to poor mental and physical health, not everyone responds to it in the same way. Some people seem to navigate loneliness without falling into persistent patterns of distress. The researchers behind this study were interested in understanding what might explain this variability — particularly how people perceive their own social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness and social support are often looked at in terms of what a person receives from others, but we were curious whether, when people feel lonely, they also see themselves as giving less to their relationships. Could a negative perception of your own ability to engage in close relationships contribute to developing prolonged loneliness?” said Emily Kent, a teaching fellow in the social sciences at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focus on how lonely individuals judge others, this study explored how they judge themselves — especially their own tendency to be supportive or to cause strain in their close relationships. The researchers also investigated whether a biological marker of emotional flexibility, known as high-frequency heart rate variability, helps moderate these perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency heart rate variability refers to the variation in time between heartbeats that is regulated by the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system. This system helps the body relax and maintain internal balance. Greater variability in this measure tends to indicate a stronger ability to adapt emotionally and socially. In past research, individuals with higher resting variability have shown better emotion regulation, stronger social skills, and greater resilience to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 824 participants in the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a long-running project tracking health and psychological outcomes in American adults. Participants had completed assessments of loneliness, and they also rated how much support or strain they believed they contributed to their relationships with friends and family. These assessments asked how often they felt they were helpful or burdensome to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, each participant also underwent a psychophysiological evaluation during which their resting heart rate variability was recorded using electrocardiography. The researchers focused on high-frequency heart rate variability, considered a specific measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we were excited to explore the idea that loneliness might not just change how people feel about others, but also how they see what they offer socially,” Kent told PsyPost. “The MIDUS dataset gave us the opportunity to test that idea in a large, real-world sample and explore whether individual differences in physiological flexibility (HF‑HRV) might help buffer those effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis indicated that individuals who reported greater feelings of loneliness also tended to see themselves as offering less support and causing more strain in both friend and family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that was really striking was how consistent the relationship between loneliness and negative self-perception was across different types of relationships,” Kent said. “It became clear that, whether it’s friends or family, loneliness was strongly linked to feeling like you give less support and contribute more strain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers were especially interested in whether heart rate variability might play a role in how people interpret their own behavior. They found tentative evidence that this physiological trait slightly influenced the link between loneliness and perceived strain in family relationships. Among those with lower resting heart rate variability, the connection between loneliness and feeling like a burden to family was stronger. In contrast, people with higher resting variability showed a weaker link between loneliness and these self-critical perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This buffering effect did not appear in evaluations of friendships or in perceptions of how much support the individual believed they provided, suggesting that the influence of heart function may be specific to certain types of self-evaluations or relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were somewhat surprised to find that resting HF-HRV (our measure of physiological flexibility) only moderated this effect in family relationships and not friendships,” Kent remarked. “That suggests there may be more nuance in how these relationship types function and how sensitive they are to our internal regulation processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that loneliness not only affects how people view others, but also how they view themselves — especially in the context of their relationships. The small but meaningful role of heart rate variability points to a potential physiological factor that influences how loneliness is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness isn’t just about what support or strain you get from other people – it’s also about how you see yourself and your confidence in your ability to connect,” Kent told PsyPost. “If you feel lonely, you might be more likely to see yourself as burdensome or believe you have little to offer friends and family. Whether or not this lines up with reality, that kind of persistent negative self-view can increase feelings of disconnection. Lonely people may withdraw not just because others are pulling away, but because they feel incapable of contributing, creating a self-fulfilling cycle of further isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study found that people with greater physiological flexibility (reflected in better regulation of their body’s stress response) were less likely to hold these negative views of themselves when thinking about family relationships. Strategies like self-compassion, cognitive reframing, and emotion regulation practices that support physiological regulation may help people recognize these thought patterns and break the cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study adds to the growing understanding of how loneliness affects self-perception, it is not without limitations. One key issue is that the data are cross-sectional, meaning all measurements were taken at a single point in time. This makes it impossible to say whether loneliness causes changes in self-perception or whether negative self-perceptions drive loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study relies on self-report measures. Although these perceptions may not reflect objective reality, they still tend to shape behavior — especially in the social realm. Someone who feels they are a burden may avoid contact with others, regardless of whether others actually view them that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physiological effects observed were also modest and specific to family relationships. The researchers caution against overinterpreting the heart rate variability findings without replication. They emphasize the need for future studies that track individuals over time to determine whether heart function helps predict long-term outcomes in social health and loneliness recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also open questions about how cultural factors and age-related changes might influence the findings. The MIDUS sample consisted largely of middle-aged and older adults. It’s unclear whether younger individuals — or those embedded in different cultural norms about family support — would show the same patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our long-term goal is to better understand the factors, including individual differences like self-perception, that contribute to variability in how people respond to loneliness,” Kent explained. “We hope to take a longitudinal approach and follow individuals over time to see how these self-views develop and change, and whether they predict who is more resilient to isolation or better able to reconnect socially.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70105" target="_blank"&gt;Loneliness Is Associated With Decreased Support and Increased Strain Given in Social Relationships&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily M Kent, Anita Restrepo, Kelly E.

Kennedy Jr. cited to justify &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;canceling some $500 million in federal grants&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine research looked impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, according to the agency, were embodied in some 400 research papers listed in &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a compilation that ran to 181 pages&lt;/a&gt;. The document was headlined “COVID-19 mRNA ‘vaccine’ harms research collection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA,” Kennedy said on &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" target="_blank"&gt;a video posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, “HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits” for respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and flu. “We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted,” he wrote in an accompanying post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body" data-long-quote&gt;I can say unequivocally that this was the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that so? A close look at the so-called data reveals that the vast majority of the cited papers — all but about 40 — have little or nothing to do with the vaccines. They concern the consequences of COVID-19 &lt;i&gt;infection&lt;/i&gt;, not the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the papers that do reference the vaccines are studies not of human subjects, but laboratory mice; in some of these studies the mice received the vaccines via injections directly into the brain or intravenously, which is not how people receive the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="519" data-module-id="00000198-9abf-dd0c-a19d-9ebf59ca0012"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s also important is the lack of evidence supporting the agency’s claims. The data packet fails to include well-researched studies attesting to the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines, including some published very recently. Among those is an exhaustive study by Danish researchers of more than 1 million recipients of the latest mRNA COVID booster, published July 28. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study investigated the incidence of 29 potential adverse side effects from the vaccine, including heart, liver and kidney failure; neurological conditions; diabetes; and arthritis. It found &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047605/andersson-2025-ld-250146-175285596115093.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“no statistically significant risk”&lt;/a&gt; of any of them from the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that is often cited by anti-vaccine agitators as a dangerous side effect of the mRNA vaccines. That condition was most commonly seen among young men, particularly if they had received two shots within a short time span. But for the most part it was mild and short-term; once the booster was reformulated after 2022, the effect appeared to disappear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No deaths from the condition were known to have occurred, and myocarditis effects were more common and serious among unvaccinated people infected with COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor did the agency’s data packet include &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047632/ioannidis-2025-oi-250049-175285453990814.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;an estimate of lives saved&lt;/a&gt; by the COVID vaccines, led by Stanford epidemiologist John P.A. Ioannidis and published July 25. That study calculated that from the beginning of the global vaccination campaign in 2020 through September 2024 as many as 4 million lives were saved by the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ioannidis acknowledged that his estimate is “conservative.” Indeed, in 2022 the Commonwealth Fund estimated that in just the first two years the vaccines were available, the shots prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047632/ioannidis-2025-oi-250049-175285453990814.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more than 3 million COVID-related deaths in the U.S. alone&lt;/a&gt;. A 2022 study in The Lancet, a British medical journal, estimated &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;as many as 20 million COVID-related lives saved&lt;/a&gt; around the world in just the first year of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weigh those figures against Kennedy’s assertion that the mRNA vaccines pose “more risks than benefits,” and it becomes evident that decision-making has gone seriously awry at the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/941921e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/320x252!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5c0b66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/568x447!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6fd17c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/768x604!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5268ca3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1024x806!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd60747/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="COVID deaths" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/744a35e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/320x252!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a1e1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/568x447!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5fb4a78/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/768x604!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e036f55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1024x806!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aad5698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aad5698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Were the mRNA vaccines ineffective against COVID-19, as RFK Jr. claims? The CDC doesn’t think so: Its figures for 2020 showed much higher death rates among the unvaccinated (solid line) than the fully vaccinated (dashed and dotted lines).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Jake Scott, an infectious disease expert at Stanford Medical School who painstakingly examined the agency’s data citations, they point to “textbook confirmation bias”—the quest for information that confirms someone’s preexisting beliefs. In this case, that someone is Kennedy, whose &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-17/with-slate-of-anti-vaccine-moves-rfk-jr-steps-up-his-assault-on-public-health"&gt;record of anti-vaccine advocacy is indisputable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between the data packet cited by Kennedy and the established facts of the vaccines’ safety and efficacy explain why Kennedy’s cancellation of 22 contracts supporting mRNA vaccine research has been greeted by experts as a senseless and devastating blow against science and public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have have been in this business for over 50 years on the front lines of public health,...and I can say unequivocally that this was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/federal-mrna-funding-cut-is-most-dangerous-public-health-decision-ever-expert-says" target="_blank"&gt;the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen&lt;/a&gt; made by a government body,” Michael Osterholm, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, told PBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, if Kennedy is so convinced that the effects mRNA vaccines are not sufficiently well-understood, the solution is &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; research, not less. I asked Kennedy’s department to respond to criticism of his decision, but received no response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few words about the mRNA technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using messenger RNA as an intermediary in their actions, the vaccines instruct the body &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mrna-vaccine-tech-could-transform-medicine-and-cure-diseases-rfk-jr-just/" target="_blank"&gt;how to manufacture parts of a pathogen&lt;/a&gt; that its immune system can recognize and fight. For immunologists, the virtues of the new technology are manifest. Vaccines to combat new pathogens or new versions of existing pathogens can be engineered quickly, allowing them to be rolled out to stifle pandemics before they even emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential utility of mRNA vaccines is unprecedentedly broad. The possible targets under study today — including in some of the research contracts Kennedy cancelled — include flu, HIV, hepatitis C, malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01393-8.epdf" target="_blank"&gt;Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania and other scientists told Nature in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Weissman shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Katalin Karikó in 2023 for their work on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the development of the mRNA COVID vaccine was sponsored by $2.5 billion in grants and purchase guarantees from the federal government to Moderna, one of the two drugmakers that brought out the COVID vaccines, partially through Operation Warp Speed, an R&amp;amp;D effort under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the agency that Kennedy has ordered to cancel the mRNA contracts. President Trump bragged about the achievement during his first term, but reversed course after the vaccines became the target of fearmongering from the right-wing and the anti-vaccine camp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kennedy’s video on X explaining his decision was replete with fundamental misconceptions about the vaccines, according to scientists and real-world data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don’t perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,” he said. But that’s plainly contradicted by the record of lives saved and hospitalizations averted. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, which falls under Kennedy’s jurisdiction, show that the average weekly COVID case rate in late 2020 was 347.8 per 100,000 population among the unvaccinated, but 25 per 100,000 among the fully vaccinated and boosted population. The weekly average death rate in the same period was 7.8 among the unvaccinated and 0.1 among the vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed that the vaccines promote the mutation of COVID; “one mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective,” Kennedy said. Neither of those statements is supported by science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MRNA vaccines do not cause the virus to mutate — they do that all on their own,” writes Steven Novella, a neurologist and veteran misinformation debunker. “What causes new variants to arise more quickly is allowing a virus to spread uninhibited throughout a population — the more it replicates, the more opportunities there are for new mutations. Widespread vaccination therefore decreases new mutations and variants.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no “one mutation” causes the vaccines to become ineffective; as vaccinologist Peter Hotez observes, in no known case has a single mutation rendered the vaccine ineffective. Boosters developed for COVID variants have remained relatively effective even as new variants become dominant. Anyway, the virtue of mRNA technology is that the vaccine can be rapidly retooled to meet the challenge of new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the data package Kennedy’s agency offered to defend his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not the product of U.S. government scientists, although one of its developers, Steven Hatfill, is currently on the HHS staff. Its other chief compilers are identified as Martin Wucher, a dentist ; Byram Bridle, a faculty member at a Canadian veterinary college; and Erik Sass, a nonfiction author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached out to all three for comment but received no reply. The compilation originated as material for a book titled “TOXIC SHOT: Facing the Dangers of the COVID ‘Vaccines’,” an anthology of essays by prominent anti-vaxxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compilation doesn’t  make the case for canceling the research. A paper listed as support for the myocarditis threat, for example, states, &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047793/icausality-ntramyocardial-inflammation-after-covid-19-vaccination-an-endomyocardial-biopsy-proven-case-series.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“no causality can be assumed or established”&lt;/a&gt; linking the condition to the vaccine because of the lack of a control group for comparison. “There is no direct evidence of a vaccine-induced inflammatory response” to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s action is almost certain to hamstring American science for years, possibly decades, to come. It’s the antithesis of Trump’s claim to put “America First,” for it cedes the development of a life-saving medical technology to Europe and China. And it’s not limited to the development of vaccines for respiratory diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent appearance on a podcast hosted by the right-wing influencer Steve Bannon, the newly-appointed commissioner of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, declared, “As far as public health goes for vaccines, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB0H2lJPGIk" target="_blank"&gt;the mRNA platform is no longer viable&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bhattacharya justified this statement by noting a rise in public skepticism about mRNA technology. What he didn’t say was that the skepticism was promoted  by Kennedy and other anti-vaxxers denigrating the technology; a competent and responsible NIH chief would be defending a technological innovation, not magnifying disinformation about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the mRNA platform is likely to be seen in retrospect as a historic advance in healthcare ... everywhere but in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOS25OWF9GT0pudFYzVWowaFFTNnZEc0psR3Rmam51YV9xREc3QXdjUzgxOWdueU5rQWttbmxWZUo0RFZRTXd0STFkSk4tQWNFc2V0ajRyMmF4dGFZeTNQMzZnMmlXM2hzdHlLWTZicFd4NFVReFNzRjNibjMwWmlBRnBtbUQwWFdWT1BCUEJEX1BPeW83cjcyM1VyV18</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：以下是人们现在可以做出的改变，以避免以后出现痴呆症-底特律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPOG1ybkRQRHcyMnF3MV9CZVBTczRDbEZJNGk2OEREd092OFBMb1h0Y1Z1ejV3QkJmYzJKNm4wTFBTUGo3cnY0alMtaVhfV3pPcl9Db0dod050dTFPOHBZZWwtcEFEekFJY2l1aFNYdHE5U0JhcXFDbkgxWGFOUWp1WXVYMkpXc2JoTjZ3cUkwQkMybWxHcDBIaWNZay00VHN0d3ZCVllTSjJzMjdoTkFEbnlXU0kxdl85QkJ6THFjRjZXVGpONHVFbGp0cS1CSGxXYzJITEZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; The females in my family on my mother's side seem to develop dementia/Alzheimer's on a fairly regular basis. It seems to become noticeable once the women are in their mid-70s or so. We girls are concerned as we head toward our elderly years and wondered which sort of diet or supplemental changes we should look into? There seems to be so many articles and opinions that it's hard to know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the positive side, our father's side of the family seems healthy and robust well into their 80s and 90s. Our extended family has females ranging from their mid-30s to 71 years of age. Are we being overly concerned? Could this be a genetic thing? Any suggestions would be helpful in calming some real fears that we have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— E.J.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear E.J.:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't think supplements are going to be the answer for dementia. I haven't seen any good data to support any of the supplements I see that are touted to prevent, slow, treat or cure dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do think that diet may help slow dementia, and one of the best diets according to the studies that have been done so far remains a Mediterranean-style diet. This includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, fish (especially fatty fish), limited amounts of red meat, and minimally processed foods. Alcohol is increasingly likely to be problematic, and I recommend against more than occasional alcohol use for people who want to minimize their risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Regular moderate exercise has a pretty clear protective effect. Although cognitive exercises like games and puzzles help improve memory short-term, it's not clear that they are preventing or delaying the onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advanced imaging, such as PET scans, are beginning to show the ability to diagnose Alzheimer's dementia in people with early symptoms. Early treatment to attack amyloids in the brain with lecanemab or donanemab slows progression of dementia by approximately 25% to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I cared for my ailing mother, and even though I tried to minimize my stress, I gained a lot of weight and still have my "cortisol belly." I need to get healthy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— D.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear D.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking care of a family member is always stressful. Taking care of yourself as well is hard, and most of us aren't able to eat, sleep, exercise, and otherwise take good care of ourselves as well as we should during a period of time when we are taking care of others. Most of us have other demands, including family and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although I often see the term "cortisol belly," it isn't the slightly elevated level of stress hormones that causes the abdominal weight gain. People who have Cushing's syndrome develop a particular type of abdominal weight gain as a result of dramatically elevated cortisol levels, as a result of a tumor, or by taking high doses of steroids. In your case, it's more likely that the result of not having healthy behaviors lead to your weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Losing abdominal weight is achieved through the same ways you would lose weight anywhere. I won't ever say it's easy, but a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise is going to improve your health, whether you lose a pound or not. I don't recommend medication treatment to lose weight unless a person is very overweight ("morbidly obese" is the precise medical term) or has medical complications related to their weight.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 09:57:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPOG1ybkRQRHcyMnF3MV9CZVBTczRDbEZJNGk2OEREd092OFBMb1h0Y1Z1ejV3QkJmYzJKNm4wTFBTUGo3cnY0alMtaVhfV3pPcl9Db0dod050dTFPOHBZZWwtcEFEekFJY2l1aFNYdHE5U0JhcXFDbkgxWGFOUWp1WXVYMkpXc2JoTjZ3cUkwQkMybWxHcDBIaWNZay00VHN0d3ZCVllTSjJzMjdoTkFEbnlXU0kxdl85QkJ6THFjRjZXVGpONHVFbGp0cS1CSGxXYzJITEZB</guid></item><item><title>特朗普此前称mRNA疫苗是“医学奇迹”。“现在， RFK Jr.削减了5亿$的资金- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPLTBSYldjMmZZYUQ1TTRkei1Ba19TbDJUMkUtaXdlaEc4cGxMUXEwQkw1SHh0c2tXbktZN05RNnhOM0lQaGpaVVJqWnpOUEg5SVh4YV9FQm9vd1F5NS0xenRpMlRhVGJlam5MVUc5ZkhvZFJlSEFXYlIwcXVETjNFdnNsLXY1VXZZd1lqQlliQ0FoNFdZbjFvZDBuZlBzb0pEWldUakFwLWxHUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020, President Donald Trump referred to it as a "medical miracle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history.

As we cannot make them, we must get them from our food. Examples include &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-a/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;; which is vital for good eyesight and maintaining healthy skin; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-c/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin C,&lt;/a&gt; which is essential for a healthy immune system, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-k/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;; which is necessary for blood clotting.

Vitamins and minerals are classed as micronutrients because we only need them in small amounts compared to macronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's fair to say that no supplement will ever replace a healthy and balanced diet. The best way, therefore, of meeting the body's requirement for vitamins is through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/food-and-nutrition/eating-well/vitamins-and-minerals/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;eating plenty&lt;/a&gt; of leafy green vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, dairy, and fish. However, research also shows that many of us are not managing to adhere to this practice. The rise of fast food, along with ultra-processed products, means convenience often triumphs over a fresh home-cooked meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOMExrV3pGY1NyV25Sckx0ZERTbVMxZ3JuNlJ4TXRCREJlWlBmT2tKSnRpdW54c3pVY3ZEZTZRTkpmZzhfeVRpTXRZTTNEVm5QOFNCay1lbmhGRDZyQnlFd1A0Rm8xM2JpQWVUQnd5SDNERWwtY3pyUEY4MkQ3clNPNElHYi1wQ09hc0l2N2R1eUM</guid></item><item><title>关闭身体疼痛警报并偷偷溜进来的寄生虫- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFB6SWZrRmYteWtmVWFtWk96QzhFNk1veUlsdGVkY1BYM2xfY0tGTUFjbTN2QnI0M3hNa2pLSTdtX2NBOFRUNm1QTlkzcnBJWGFHRjdKaWllaTFxelNLRXFiREFDbGVXSzFHX0hwLUMtdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by helminths, a type of worm. Infection occurs during contact with infested water through activities like swimming, washing clothes, and fishing, when larvae penetrate the skin. Surprisingly, the worm often evades detection by the immune system, unlike other bacteria or parasites that typically cause pain, itching, or rashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new study, researchers from Tulane School of Medicine aimed to find out why the parasitic worm &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/em&gt; doesn't cause pain or itching when it penetrates the skin. Their findings show that &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni &lt;/em&gt;causes a reduction in the activity of TRPV1+, a protein that sends signals the brain interprets as heat, pain, or itching. As part of pain-sensing in sensory neurons, TRPV1+ regulates immune responses in many scenarios such as infection, allergy, cancer, autoimmunity, and even hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/em&gt; produces molecules that suppress TRPV1+ to block signals from being sent to the brain, allowing &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/em&gt; to infect the skin largely undetected. It is likely &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni &lt;/em&gt;evolved the molecules that block TRPV1+ to enhance its survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;If we identify and isolate the molecules used by helminths to block TRPV1+ activation, it may present a novel alternative to current opioid-based treatments for reducing pain," said Dr. De'Broski R. Herbert, Professor of Immunology at Tulane School of Medicine, who led the study. "The molecules that block TRPV1+ could also be developed into therapeutics that reduce disease severity for individuals suffering from painful inflammatory conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that TRPV1+ is necessary for initiating host protection against &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni. &lt;/em&gt;TRPV1+ activation leads to the rapid mobilization of immune cells, including gd T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, that induce inflammation. This inflammation plays a crucial role in host resistance to the larval entry into the skin. These findings highlight the importance of neurons that sense pain and itching in successful immune responses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying the molecules in &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni &lt;/em&gt;that block TRPV1+ could inform preventive treatments for schistosomiasis. We envision a topical agent which activates TRPV1+ to prevent infection from contaminated water for individuals at risk of acquiring &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni,&lt;/em&gt;" said Dr. Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, mice were infected with &lt;em&gt;S. mansoi &lt;/em&gt;and evaluated for their sensitivity to pain as well as the role of TRPV1+ in preventing infection. Researchers next plan to identify the nature of the secreted or surface-associated helminth molecules that are responsible for blocking TRPV1+ activity and specific gd T cell subsets that are responsible for immune responses. The researchers also seek to further understand the neurons that helminths have evolved to suppress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency said: ‘Before any international travel, make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK’s last confirmed case of polio was in 1984, but it was last detected in wastewater in 2022. The entire European region was declared polio-free by the World Health Organization in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious nervous system disease spread by the poliovirus, which targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naturally-occurring poliovirus, or wild-type poliovirus, has been eradicated from the US and most developed countries, while another version derived from vaccines is more common but still rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People carrying poliovirus can spread it through droplets from sneezing or coughing and feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While about nine in 10 people with polio don’t develop symptoms, around five percent report mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. This is called ‘abortive polio.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one percent of patients develop nonparalytic polio, which causes more severe flu-like symptoms, neck and spine stiffness, decreased reflexes and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonparalytic polio can progress to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. It leads to intense pain, extreme sensitivity to touch, tingling sensations, muscle spasms of twitching and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paralytic polio can affect any limb or organ, but if it spreads to the lungs, it could lead to deadly breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC said in its advisory: ‘Polio can be fatal if the muscles used for breathing are paralyzed or if there is an infection of the brain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paul Alexander of Texas (pictured here) was paralyzed from polio at age six.

							&lt;p&gt;His cholesterol had spiked despite medication, his blood pressure remained stubbornly high, and early signs of arterial stiffening were evident. "But I eat healthy," he protested, describing his daily breakfast of turkey bacon, whole grain cereal, and orange juice. That's when she had to break the news: some of his "healthy" choices were anything but—especially after 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foods that might have been fine at 40 become cardiovascular time bombs after 60. Your metabolism slows, your arteries stiffen, your body's ability to process certain foods fundamentally changes. What cardiologists know—and wish everyone over 60 understood—is that three common foods most people eat daily are particularly dangerous for aging hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Processed meats (yes, even the "healthy" ones)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey bacon, lean deli meat, chicken sausage—they market themselves as healthy alternatives, but they're wolves in sheep's clothing. That "uncured" label? Meaningless. That "no nitrates added"? They use celery powder, which converts to the same nitrites in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 60, your body's ability to neutralize &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6267163/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sodium and preservatives&lt;/a&gt; diminishes dramatically. A single serving of deli turkey contains up to 1,000mg of sodium—nearly half your daily limit. But it's not just the sodium. The preservatives in processed meats create compounds that directly damage arterial walls, accelerate plaque formation, and increase inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen's patients always ask: "What about organic?" "What about nitrate-free?" Her answer never changes: "There's no such thing as heart-healthy processed meat after 60."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replacement:&lt;/strong&gt; Actual cooked chicken or turkey, prepared at home. Yes, it's more work. But your arteries don't care about convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Commercial orange juice (even "100% pure")&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sits in millions of refrigerators, consumed daily by people convinced they're making a healthy choice. But commercial orange juice—even the premium, not-from-concentrate varieties—is essentially &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/sugary-drinks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;liquid sugar&lt;/a&gt; that hits your bloodstream like a glucose grenade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single glass contains up to 24 grams of sugar with none of the fiber that whole oranges provide to slow absorption. After 60, your body's insulin response is already compromised. This morning sugar bomb triggers inflammatory responses, contributes to arterial stiffening, and accelerates the development of diabetes—a major cardiovascular risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "but it's natural sugar" argument collapses under scrutiny. Your arteries don't distinguish between sugar from oranges and sugar from candy. The glycemic impact is nearly identical, but juice comes with a health halo that makes people drink it daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replacement:&lt;/strong&gt; Whole oranges occasionally, water primarily. If you must have morning juice, dilute it 3:1 with water. Better yet, break the juice habit entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Whole grain cereals (the "heart-healthy" ones)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those cheerful boxes with hearts on them, promising to lower cholesterol and support cardiovascular health? They're highly processed carbohydrates disguised as health food. Even the "whole grain" varieties are often &lt;a href="https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/whats-whole-grain-refined-grain#:~:text=White%20%EF%AC%82our%20and%20white%20rice,shadow%20of%20its%20original%20self." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;refined and reconstituted&lt;/a&gt;, stripped of nutrients then "enriched" with synthetic vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 60, your body's ability to process rapid carbohydrate influxes declines. These cereals—even the ones that seem healthy—create blood sugar spikes that damage blood vessel linings, increase inflammation, and contribute to insulin resistance. The added sugars (yes, even in "healthy" cereals) compound the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "fortified with vitamins" claim is particularly insidious. Your body after 60 doesn't absorb synthetic vitamins efficiently. You're getting sugar-bombed for minimal nutritional benefit, all while believing you're making a heart-healthy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replacement:&lt;/strong&gt; Steel-cut oats (not instant), prepared with water or unsweetened plant milk, topped with nuts and berries. Or better: protein-based breakfasts that don't spike blood sugar at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chen's patient eliminated these three foods and saw dramatic improvements within three months—without changing his medication. His cholesterol dropped, blood pressure normalized, and inflammation markers decreased significantly. The foods he'd thought were healthy had been silently undermining his cardiovascular system for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel irony is that these foods specifically market themselves to health-conscious older adults. They exploit the desire to be healthy while delivering the opposite. After 60, your margin for dietary error shrinks dramatically. Foods your body once tolerated become actively harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? Removing these three foods isn't about deprivation—it's about substitution. Real food instead of processed, whole fruits instead of juice, intact grains instead of refined cereals. Your taste buds might protest initially, but your arteries will thank you. And after 60, your arteries' opinion matters more than your taste buds' preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro (known as semaglutide and tirzepatide) have changed the way clinicians manage  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170960" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and obesity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists"&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1. This limits both hunger and interest in food, helping users lose weight, and helps control blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies published today show that people taking these drugs may have a small increased risk of serious eye conditions and vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-tentatively-linked-with-sudden-vision-loss-risk"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs 'Tentatively' Linked With Sudden Vision Loss Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know if you're taking or considering these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What damage can occur?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, is a rare but devastating eye condition that occurs when blood flow to the optic nerve is suddenly reduced or blocked. It's also called an "eye stroke".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of NAION remains unclear and there are no current treatments available. People with diabetes are at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076653"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other eye conditions that develop gradually, NAION causes a sudden, painless loss of vision. Patients typically notice the condition when they wake up and discover they've lost vision in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vision tends to worsen over a couple of weeks and slowly stabilises. Recovery of vision is variable, but around &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/naion-diagnosis-and-management"&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of people do not experience improvement in their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What has previous research shown?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous study from 2024 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.2296"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; participants prescribed semaglutide for diabetes were four times more likely to develop NAION. For those taking it for weight loss, the risk was almost eight times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; concluded NAION represented a "very rare" side effect of semaglutide medications: a one in 10,000 chance. In a first for medicines regulators, the agency now requires product labels to include NAION as a documented risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the recent studies suggest the risks may be lower than we first thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to NAION, there is also evidence to suggest GLP-1 drugs can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141"&gt;worsen&lt;/a&gt; diabetic eye disease, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611"&gt;diabetic retinopathy&lt;/a&gt;. This occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642.jpg" alt="retina image" class="wp-image-170962 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Image of the retina, with blood vessels near the optic nerve. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEEjg34OEY/"&gt;olaaf/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound counter-intuitive, but rapid blood sugar reductions can also destabilise the fragile blood vessels in the retina and lead to bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do the new studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two newly published studies investigated people with type 2 diabetes living in the United States over two years. The studies looked at the medical records of 159,000 to 185,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26327"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found semaglutide or tirzepatide was associated with a more modest risk of developing NAION than previously thought. Of 159,000 people with type 2 diabetes who were taking these drugs, 35 people (0.04%) developed NAION, compared with 19 patients (0.02%) in the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found an increased risk of developing "other optic nerve disorders". However, it's unclear what kind of optic nerve disorders this includes, as the medical record codes used didn't specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter to this, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26321"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; did not find an increased risk of NAION among those taking GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers found a small increase in the number of people developing diabetic retinopathy in those prescribed GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall, participants on GLP-1 drugs experienced fewer sight-threatening complications related to their diabetic retinopathy and required less invasive eye treatments compared to the group taking other diabetes medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are still needed to understand how GLP-1 drugs can lead to eye complications. A current, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03811561"&gt;five-year clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; is studying the long-term effects of semaglutides and diabetic eye disease in 1,500 people, which should tell us more about the ocular risks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for people taking GLP-1 drugs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAION is a serious condition. But we need to strike a balance between these (and other) &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/people-on-ozempic-may-have-fewer-heart-attacks-strokes-and-addictions-but-more-nausea-vomiting-and-stomach-pain-247683"&gt;risks and the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 medications in diabetes care, obesity treatment, reducing heart attack risks and extending lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key lies in informed decision-making and identifying different levels of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with multiple NAION risk factors – such as sleep apnoea, high blood pressure and diabetes – should undergo careful consideration with their treating doctor before starting these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170966" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170966" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642.jpg" alt="person holding weight loss drug" class="wp-image-170966 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642-600x348.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170966" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with risk factors for NAION should discuss their use of GLP-1 medications with their doctor. (David Petrus Ibars/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crowded" optic nerve heads are also a risk factor for NAION. This is an anatomical feature where blood vessels at the optic nerve head are tightly packed together. People with crowded optic nerve heads should also undergo careful consideration before starting GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although NAION can strike without warning, regular comprehensive eye examinations with your optometrist or ophthalmologist still serve important purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can detect other drug-related eye problems, including worsening diabetic retinopathy, and can identify patients with crowded optic nerve heads. It's also important to tell them if you are taking GLP-1 medications so they can keep a close watch on your eye health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-021-05522-4"&gt;Emerging research&lt;/a&gt; also suggests that improving your heart health might help reduce risks of developing NAION. This includes proper management of high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol – all conditions that compromise the small blood vessels feeding the optic nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13164670"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; also show patients with heart conditions who better adhere to their medication prescriptions have lower risks of NAION than those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors should discuss NAION risks during prescribing decisions and work with eye care providers to monitor regularly for diabetic eye disease. Patients need clear instructions to seek immediate medical attention for sudden vision loss and the need for regular eye examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggressive treatment of sleep apnoea and other heart conditions may also help reduce NAION risks. But for now, there remains an ongoing need for more research to understand how GLP-1 medications can affect the eye.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262874/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;MOORHEAD — The Moorhead City Council further delayed aerial spraying for mosquito control after residents expressed concern for a spray’s effect on pollinators like butterflies and bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Aug. 11, council members discussed aerial spraying after resident backlash to a planned aerial spray. Most residents who spoke during the meeting expressed concern about the practice, but some asked the city to conduct the citywide spray.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;While aerial spraying is postponed for now, in a press release sent shortly after the meeting ended, the city alerted residents to a ground spray starting at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city planned to conduct an aerial spray Thursday, Aug. 7, due to an increase in the mosquito-borne disease West Nile virus detected in the area. However, the

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Monday’s meeting, Mayor Shelly Carlson explained it was not postponed due to resident opposition. The city of Moorhead requires pesticide chemicals to be applied in lesser concentrations than neighboring Fargo, and the logistics of switching the chemicals ultimately delayed the spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than an hour of discussion, the Moorhead City Council voted 5-4 to delay the spray to take another look at its mosquito control policy. Council members Nicole Mattson, Heather Nesemeier, Deb White and Lisa Borgen voted for the delay, while Council Members Ryan Nelson, Emily Moore, Sebastian McDougall and Chuck Hendrickson voted against it. Mayor Shelly Carlson cast the tiebreaking vote to delay aerial spraying.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Mattson argued against aerial spraying, sharing statistics about West Nile virus and the effectiveness of aerial spraying. Most residents reaching out to her about the spray were against it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore argued the city should stick to its policy and conduct the spray because of the risk of West Nile virus, which can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personally, I can’t stomach a death in our community because we fail to take action and protect human health and safety,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to 90 cases, including three deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600053b6nl44gsl77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The update comes days after New York City’s health department proposed &lt;a href="https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/RequestDetail/20250801026" target="_blank"&gt;new regulations&lt;/a&gt; for the testing of cooling towers, which they suspect are linked to the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600063b6nh54s6bxl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cooling towers are rooftop devices that release mist into the air as they cool large buildings. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella bacteria can grow and infect people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600073b6n5e8i90z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Department of Health spokesperson told CNN the proposed rules “were in development well before the Legionnaires’ cluster in Central Harlem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600083b6n9ksg0af1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under New York City law, building owners are responsible for registering and maintaining their cooling towers and they’re routinely inspected for compliance. The proposal would set specific time periods for testing and require test sampling be conducted by state-certified labs. It also details monetary penalties for noncompliance, although the posted documents didn’t specify amounts. Currently, building owners who fail to follow routine maintenance rules &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodelibrary.amlegal.com%2Fcodes%2Fnewyorkcity%2Flatest%2FNYCrules%2F0-0-0-97837&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7C9e363dfd931149f02ed708ddd92ddbf8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638905513164878258%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=0%2F%2BxHWeOkliDcXUXNb4pi1Xde34H1LmfVCid19Q4aic%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;face fines&lt;/a&gt; of $500 to $2,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7saoi300003b6nph0ndfrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The proposed changes to testing and fines, however, may come with the challenge of enforcement — city data shows that the city conducted a record low number of inspections in 2024, with less than half the inspections of 2017, when inspection numbers were first recorded. The decline in inspections was first reported by &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2Fnews%2Flegionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7C9e363dfd931149f02ed708ddd92ddbf8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638905513164929123%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=FuzutEYOhzKptC%2F8%2F8m3FDG3m8BtplTb2CR%2BSdmSPqg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Gothamist&lt;/a&gt;.

            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Health officials say all operable cooling towers in the area have been tested, and those that tested positive for Legionella were ordered to be cleaned. The department said it confirmed that the required cleanings were carried out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbqkl000c3b6nwmvadji4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Longevity specialist Dan Buettner championed air-popped popcorn as 'the best longevity snack [that] might already be in your pantry'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best longevity snack might already be in your pantry,' teased a caption accompanying the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The food in question?

It's easy to store. And most importantly, it's delicious,' Dan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Homemade air-popped popcorn is distinct from store-bought packets, microwave popcorn or movie popcorn, in that it's made using no added ingredients beyond being cooked in a small amount of hot oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although Dan didn't make specific mention of it in his video, it is fair to presume that he recommends enjoying air-popped popcorn without the addition of any other added ingredients like salt or butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest video has notched up over 726,000 views on TikTok, with many commenters excited by the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My favourite snack!

This rises to more than one in three (35 per cent) of those aged under 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The soaring demand is because these revolutionary medications can deliver &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-e4b687f0-76d3-11f0-8544-d7c818d8acf5"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; of up to 15 to 20 per cent of body weight in a year, often without effort – they work by mimicking the hormone GLP-1, reducing appetite (and cravings) and delaying stomach emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pharmaceutical companies are reaping billions in profits from these drugs – and now old and new players are racing to create even better obesity treatments, many of which work in entirely new ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the new generation are more sophisticated variants of the original GLP-1 jabs, such as Wegovy or Mounjaro, but reduce the number of injections from weekly to as little as once every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pills are also in development to eliminate the need for needles. Other drugs in development work by building muscle while burning fat, or by speeding up metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a revolution unfolding in front of our eyes,' says Carel Le Roux, a professor of metabolic medicine at Ulster University. 'Next-generation medications will allow even more weight loss in safer ways.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex Miras, a clinical professor of medicine, also at Ulster University, believes that in ten years 'we will have truly personalised obesity medicine'. He says: 'Patients will be matched to the drug most likely to work for them based on biology, genetics and personal goals to achieve the best results with the fewest side-effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists hope some newer weight-loss drugs will have longer-lasting effects than Wegovy or Mounjaro – currently only around 2 to 10 per cent of people keep all their lost weight off if they stop taking GLP-1 drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A University of Oxford study published earlier this year found that people using Wegovy or Mounjaro lost an average of 16kg, but regained an average of almost 10kg in a year if they stopped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists hope some of these drugs will have longer-lasting effects on weight than Wegovy or Mounjaro – currently only around 2 to 10 per cent of people keep all their lost weight off if they stop taking GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A University of Oxford study published earlier this year found that people using Wegovy or Mounjaro lost an average of 16kg, but regained an average of almost 10kg in a year if they stopped – and were on target to regain all 16kg in around 20 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the new weight-loss drugs in the pipeline seem to lead to better maintenance, without as much weight re-gain. But Professor Le Roux says none of them are a 'one and done' treatment. 'So we need to ask people, "Are you prepared to be on these drugs for the rest of your life?"' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putting people on medication for life is controversial – some experts argue that the drugs should be used in the short-term only, supported by counselling and healthier eating for long-term maintenance of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Professor Le Roux believes that their effects are so transformative on many aspects of health that we should see them as longer-term medications, 'like blood pressure treatments or statins'. Here, we look at some of the newest weight-loss drugs that could be coming soon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;The 'gym in a jab'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today's main weight-loss wonder drugs, semaglutide (brand names Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro), mimic a gut hormone, GLP-1, which is released after eating. Tirzepatide mimics GLP-1 and another gut hormone called GIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for every 3kg of fat lost, people tend to lose around 1kg of muscle, says Professor Le Roux. Muscle is vital for health, strength and metabolism (including burning calories), so preserving it is key, particularly as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Enter bimagrumab, a new drug that works like weight training in a syringe. Exercise, particularly weight training, helps build muscle – part of the way this happens is that it lowers levels of a protein called myostatin, which regulates muscle growth and fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carel Le Roux, a professor of metabolic medicine at Ulster University, says 'next-generation medications will allow even more weight loss in safer ways'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Biopharmaceutical company Amgen is developing the fat jab MariTide, which may only need to be taken twice a year to be effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bimagrumab does a similar thing pharmaceutically, helping users lose fat while gaining calorie-burning lean muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study, published in June in the journal Endocrine Today, found that patients given bimagrumab alone without any special diet or exercise regimen lost 10.8 per cent of their body weight in 48 weeks – all from fat – while gaining 2.5 per cent lean muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And because bimagrumab, unlike GLP-1 drugs, does not reduce appetite, this happened while users ate around the same number of calories as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were even more dramatic when bimagrumab was combined with semaglutide. Adding appetite suppression meant people lost 22.1 per cent of body weight, of which 92.8 per cent was fat, compared with 71.8 per cent for semaglutide alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine in the US and part of the research team, said the drug seems especially effective at reducing visceral fat, the type that surrounds abdominal organs and contributes to what he describes as the 'metabolic mayhem' associated with obesity, such as insulin resistance (where the cells are unable to take up sugar from the blood, leading to type 2 diabetes) and chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People on the highest dose of bimagrumab plus semaglutide lost 58 per cent of their visceral fat and their waist size shrank by an average of 9in (22cm). 'Equivalent to 8.5 holes on a belt,' said Professor Aronne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as weight loss, people taking the highest dose of bimagrumab plus semaglutide saw levels of a key biomarker of chronic inflammation decrease by 83 per cent after just under a year of treatment. (Chronic inflammation is linked to a host of health problems, from joint pain and low mood to heart disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the fast weight regain usually seen when people stop taking GLP-1 drugs does not occur with bimagrumab, other research suggests. A study in 2023 by the manufacturer Versanis assessed bimagrumab in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This showed a 21.9 per cent reduction in fat mass after 48 weeks of treatment and an increase of lean muscle mass of 4.5 per cent. The same patients were followed for an additional 12 weeks after the last dose and experienced no weight regain. This may be down to the healthier composition of their bodies, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far, bimagrumab has only been given by intravenous infusion in hospital every few months. Future trials will use injectable versions. Reported side-effects included muscle spasms, diarrhoea and acne in addition to the nausea, constipation and fatigue caused by semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More trials are under way, with results due in January 2027. These will be followed by larger safety and efficacy trials – so an approval could be a few years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;2-in-1 'surgery' drug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The company behind Ozempic, Novo Nordisk, has developed new drug CagriSema, which combines semaglutide with a new molecule called cagrilintide. This is a synthetic version of the hormone amylin, produced in the pancreas, which helps us feel full and may play a role in breaking down fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In trials, cagrilintide alone led to a 10.8 per cent weight loss over 26 weeks. Combining it with semaglutide magnified the effect, with obese participants losing an average of 22.7 per cent of body weight over 68 weeks. This means CagriSema outperformed Wegovy (14 per cent of body weight lost) and Mounjaro (20 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 per cent of people on CagriSema experienced a weight loss of at least 25 per cent – with almost a quarter losing 30 per cent or more. This is comparable to stomach-reduction surgery, which varies between 22 and 26 per cent, depending on the type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Le Roux says early studies showed rats given CagriSema were able to eat 25 per cent more food than rats not on the medication yet lose the same amount of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because when rats (or people) diet, the body tries to defend its fat stores by slowing metabolism and reducing the calories burned, he says – as well as ramping up hunger. But cagrilintide persuades the body it should be at a lower weight, so these mechanisms don't kick in and metabolism doesn't change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The beauty of this combination is that it targets two distinct satiety-or-fullness pathways in the brain, increasing the effect,' says Professor Miras, who adds that CagriSema appears similar to semaglutide in terms of potential side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also shown that the weekly injection leads to improvements in blood pressure and inflammation similar to those seen with Mounjaro and Wegovy. One potential hurdle, however, is that CagriSema's two components can't be dissolved together, requiring them to be manufactured separately and then delivered with a dual-chambered pen, which could prove expensive and inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Novo Nordisk plans to submit CagriSema for approval in the US early next year, meaning it could be available to patients in late 2026 on private prescription. Approval for NHS use could take longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;The twice-yearly jab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MariTide is a two-in-one tool for weight loss. Unlike Mounjaro, which activates both GLP-1 and GIP hormone receptors, MariTide blocks GIP while activating GLP-1. (Scientists don't understand why both activating and blocking GIP leads to similar weight-loss effects, but it does).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trials show MariTide leads to a loss of around 20 per cent of body weight in a year. But the real game-changer is that the drug is designed to be effective for longer periods than current jabs. In trials, people used it monthly, but there's evidence the half-life of the drug in the body could be even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data presented at the American Diabetes Association conference in June showed many participants maintained their weight loss for as long as six months after taking it, raising the prospect of twice-yearly jabs to keep the weight off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, around 90 per cent of people experienced nausea and vomiting while on MariTide, with up to a third ditching the drug during the trial as a result. The manufacturer, Amgen, is trialling it at much lower doses to reduce the severity of these side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trials are ongoing. If results continue to be positive, MariTide could be available from 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;'The next blockbuster' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most anticipated new weight-loss drugs is retatrutide, developed by Mounjaro maker Eli Lilly. Known as the 'triple G' drug, it targets three receptors: GLP-1, GIP and glucagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While GLP-1 and GIP reduce appetite and increase satiety, glucagon increases the calories the body burns at rest. In a trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2023, patients taking the highest dose of retatrutide as a weekly injection lost an average of 24.2 per cent of body weight in 48 weeks. This is even more effective than Novo Nordisk's CagriSema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the next blockbuster drug,' says Professor Miras. 'To see this weight loss in under a year without surgery is remarkable. This raises the bar. This is way beyond my wildest dreams.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glucagon also helps balance blood sugar levels. Significantly, it reduces liver fat and can even reverse liver scarring caused by fatty liver disease, a condition that affects one in five adults in Britain. Untreated, fatty liver disease can progress to liver cancer. This effect means retatrutide could be used for liver disease alone, says Professor Miras. However, glucagon can be 'tricky to tolerate and can trigger nausea and vomiting', he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Le Roux adds: 'Glucagon increases energy expenditure, which is a novel mechanism and trials need to show this is safe.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Retatrutide is in the final phase of clinical trials and may be available in the UK within 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Pills to cut your appetite in a flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Hate needles? Well, there's good news, as weight-loss pills are on the horizon...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Orforglipron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a once-daily pill, which, like semaglutide, mimicks GLP-1 – it helps regulate blood sugar levels and reduces appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In final stage trials, reported last week, those taking the drug lost an average of 12.4 per cent of their body weight after 72 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far, side-effects are similar to those from other GLP-1 medications: nausea, diarrhoea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pill can be taken at any time of the day. 'This is a very exciting drug,' says Professor Le Roux, professor of metabolic medicine at Ulster University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eli Lilly aims to submit orforglipron for US approval as a weight-loss treatment by the end of 2025. It could become available in the UK in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Rybelsus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Novo Nordisk is working on a weight-loss version of its daily semaglutide tablet, Rybelsus, currently only licensed for type 2 diabetes. By raising the dose from 14mg to 25mg in trials, participants achieved 13.6 per cent weight loss after 68 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A trial published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine also found a 14 per cent reduction in risk of heart attacks and strokes. The downsides? Rybelsus must be taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before food, which may limit appeal. It has similar side-effects to injectable semaglutide, including nausea and vomiting. A plan for a 50mg dose was abandoned due to increased side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 25mg pill could be available in the US by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Amycretin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Novo Nordisk is developing this drug as both a daily pill and an injection. It mimics GLP-1 and amylin, the pancreatic hormone that regulates glucose, satiety and fat metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In studies published in July in The Lancet, participants trying the jab lost up to 24 per cent of their body weight in 36 weeks. This is more weight loss at a faster rate than Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early trials have also showed 13.1 per cent weight loss in people who used the daily pill for 12 weeks. Professor Le Roux says: 'This is an exciting drug with similar but possibly fewer gastrointestinal side-effects than semaglutide and tirzepatide.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;When will it be available?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still in early trials. Novo Nordisk hopes it could be available before 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:27:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNWjE0T3VRMGt3Q24xdjhtWGN5OTZibUl6RmhmQkczNHh0dnpSZ0Q5V1lUWWtwcHF2YkdXZm5GZC1fczdJemZCUkZrUDJlSUt4R011NFRBcmw4WjA0WGhrOUN6SEF6OWNOTU1BU0FlYTVSVGQ5UHNhR0lBWTZnSGQwb0xNZnRmamVYT3plVk1KaE9Vd25Ea3RibHVpOE9CQ2h4YVoyeTZRZmRTYlBJTWk5S3dR</guid></item><item><title>这个惊人的斑点与人脑惊人的相似- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOTXBYY0Eyd18tZFppbjB3d0lQNGx4QmxXSkJydVpvTWFxa25PY09HWDZqTFlFTzg0Y1RFclprekNoYWJmWGNITllFSm1oN043M19MVDFiLWhLdHpKSzFWRF9wUlpFcHNFTGt2QjZ3MzM2ZDk0X05HZVRSVmk2M3JUMUlHTjNCalBrRGNqY1FJem8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A tiny blob of gelatinous tissue sitting in a dish represents a giant leap forward in human brain research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoid&lt;/a&gt;, it's a living 3D model of a human organ; one of the first to constitute multiple different regions of the brain. Moreover, those regions connect up with each other and light up with neuronal activity, comparable to the brain of a human fetus at 40 days gestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've made the next generation of brain  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/news-events/news/johns-hopkins-scientists-grow-novel-whole-brain-organoid/"&gt;says biomedical engineer Annie Kathuria&lt;/a&gt; of Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most brain organoids that you see in papers are one brain region, like the cortex or the hindbrain or midbrain. We've grown a rudimentary whole-brain organoid; we call it the multi-region brain organoid (MRBO)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-grew-stem-cell-mini-brains-and-then-the-brains-sort-of-developed-eyes"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists Grew Stem Cell 'Mini Brains' And Then The Brains Sort-of Developed Eyes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids are not full organs, but scaled-down versions grown from cell and tissue cultures in a laboratory setting. Their purpose is to allow scientists to research changes, differences, and interactions with, say, new medications, without needing to probe a living human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for brains. The most complex organ in the human body, it is also the most poorly understood. You can't just go around poking a person's brain willy-nilly – you could break something important extremely easily – so brain organoids provide a crucial platform to help understand brain function, disease, and neurological conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To grow their brain organoid, the researchers take blood and skin cells from living humans to create induced pluripotent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. These are cells that are induced to return to a 'stem' state, from which they can develop into any type of cell in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stem cells are then cultured to diversify and transform into various cell types from different regions of the human brain, all in their own separate petri dishes. Only once each of these individual regions are sufficiently developed are they joined together with sticky proteins that act like a sort of glue that allows the separate tissues to form connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organoid is pretty small, consisting of around 6 to 7 million neurons, compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/11-fun-facts-about-your-brain"&gt;tens of billions of neurons&lt;/a&gt; in a fully developed human brain. Though magnitudes simpler than fully developed brains, they present a reasonable model for how the full human brain operates as an integrated network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/imaging.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-170309" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/imaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/imaging-600x354.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170309" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Imaging of different proteins in the organoids. (Kshirsagar et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Sci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few exciting findings. The blood vessels in the connected organoid grew and began to form new blood vessels. The researchers also found evidence of gene expression associated with the different regions of the organoid, and early signs of the development of a blood-brain barrier – the crucial membrane that protects the delicate organ from harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This organoid, the researchers say, provides a new platform that will allow scientists to study and analyze the complexities of brain function over time, which in turn could give important insight into neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, and help develop treatments thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; affect the whole brain, not just one part of the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/news-events/news/johns-hopkins-scientists-grow-novel-whole-brain-organoid/"&gt;Kathuria says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can understand what goes wrong early in development, we may be able to find new targets for drug screening. We can test new drugs or treatments on the organoids and determine whether they're actually having an impact on the organoids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202503768"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meningitis can be quickly spotted in babies with “great accuracy” thanks to a new non-invasive device developed to do the testing anywhere it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study showed that it identified the potentially deadly infection in new-borns and infants with 94% accuracy, potentially transforming current screening methods based on traditional lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the high-resolution ultrasound device offers a non-invasive alternative to a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap, where a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. When caused by bacteria or fungi, it can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. Even in cases where the disease is overcome, it can leave serious after-effects, including brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite medical advances in recent decades, meningitis remains a major threat to child health, and diagnosing it currently requires a spinal tap to collect the fluid—an invasive technique with associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new international study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-025-04179-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in the journal&lt;/a&gt; Pediatric Research, was led by scientists at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) in Spain, and involved patients at hospitals in Spain, Mozambique, and Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to validate the ‘Neosonics’ device, which uses high-frequency ultrasound applied through the baby’s open fontanelle, the membranous gap between the bones of the skull, which has not yet closed- to visualize and analyze CSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep learning algorithm interprets the images, identifies and counts the cells, and determines whether there are inflammatory signs consistent with meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The device was able to correctly classify 17 out of 18 meningitis cases and 55 out of 58 controls without meningitis,” said lead author Dr. Sara Ajanovic, of ISGlobalin, in the team’s &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092671" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;media release&lt;/a&gt; in English. (&lt;em&gt;Spanish version &lt;a href="https://www.isglobal.org/ca/-/una-prueba-no-invasiva-permite-detectar-la-meningitis-infantil-con-alta-precision-diagnostica-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Specifically, it detected high white blood cell levels in cerebrospinal fluid with approximately 94% sensitivity and 95% specificity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMAZING&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="World’s Smallest Pacemaker is Made for Newborns, Activated by Light, and Requires No Surgery" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-size-of-a-rice-grain-worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/" rel="bookmark"&gt;World’s Smallest Pacemaker is Made for Newborns, Activated by Light, and Requires No Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says the new device—cost-effective, portable, and easy to use—could not only reduce lumbar punctures, but can also be used in clinically unstable patients where lumbar puncture aren’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study senior author Professor Quique Bassat, ISGlobal’s director general, explained: “Introducing a non-invasive tool could reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, prevent complications associated with lumbar puncture, and improve both early diagnosis and non-invasive monitoring of treatment response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the project’s objectives was to bring health care to all inhabitants of Morocco, where the mortality risk of children living in rural areas is double that of those living in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BABY LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Playing Classical Music to Babies in the Womb Can Stimulate Development, Affect Heart Rate and Nervous system" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/playing-classical-music-to-babies-in-the-womb-can-stimulate-heart-rate-and-nervous-system/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Playing Classical Music to Babies in the Womb Can Stimulate Development, Affect Heart Rate and Nervous system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neosonics can provide the Moroccan health system with a tool to improve access to health for the entire population, both in cities and in regions furthest from the public health system network,” &lt;a href="https://www.isglobal.org/ca/-/una-prueba-no-invasiva-permite-detectar-la-meningitis-infantil-con-alta-precision-diagnostica-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says Javier Jiménez&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of New Born Solutions, the Spanish company that developed and manufactured the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was conducted between 2020 and 2023 and included more than 200 babies aged up to 24 months. Its validation of Neosonics marks a first step towards incorporating the valuable tool into clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

But it really isn't the case," Macpherson said, per the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is DSV's report so concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Macpherson wasn't wrong — even &lt;span&gt;diligent consumers&lt;/span&gt; who take steps to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid plastic&lt;/a&gt; or other potential contaminants often can't rely on manufacturers' disclosures for everything from what's in our kitchens to how objects might adversely impact household health and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;DSV's review noted that novel entities evade detection, emphasizing "critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research, and testing methods" to quantify the vast array of adverse impacts on humans — with particularly pronounced effects on reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The way that we've generally done the testing has meant that we've missed a lot of effects," Macpherson observed, and DSV's "Novel Entities: A Ticking Time Bomb" report bore that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Two million lives and 53 million disability-adjusted life-years … were lost in 2019 due to exposure to selected chemicals," it read, highlighting exposure to lead and occupational contamination as the "biggest drivers of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given the framing of the report, "nothing" appeared to be an unsettling answer to that conclusion, but Macpherson advocated for serious research and funding and a shockingly simple partial solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers "obviously don't want less funding" for climate research.

But these guidelines have not been updated since 2021, and the Prostate Cancer UK argues they do not take into account advances in testing and diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Vincent Gnanapragasam, professor of urology at the University of Cambridge, said: &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Active surveillance is the best treatment option for men whose cancer is unlikely to progress or cause them problems in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But NICE’s outdated guidelines have created a deeply concerning wild west on how surveillance is implemented by different health care teams. This inconsistency is resulting in a lack of confidence from patients in surveillance, who may instead opt to have treatment they may not have ever needed, risking harmful side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fHfZpe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Michael Lewis was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-353932"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Michael Lewis was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Prostate Cancer UK)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the charity, overtreatment rates in England range from 2 to 24 per cent, and it warns that this results in a “postcode lottery” in which some men receive treatment unnecessarily while others receive monitoring as they should. It also found 35 hospitals have created their own guidelines on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis, 63, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020. The nurse, from Dudley, said&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;“My doctors told me my cancer was ‘low-risk’ and not likely to spread quickly, so I was put on active surveillance until 2024, when my PSA level started to rise again, so I had surgery to remove my prostate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being on active surveillance meant I didn’t have to have treatment until I needed to.

I’m glad I was able to get treatment when I needed it, but having the time without it was so valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Thanks to advances in research, we can now tell which prostate cancers require immediate treatment, and which men would be better off being monitored with blood tests and scans – enabling them to delay treatment or even avoid treatment altogether.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the treatments for prostate cancer, such as radiotherapy or surgery, can lead to “life-changing side effects, like incontinence or erectile dysfunction, which can have a huge mental and physical impact on men”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NICE’s outdated guidance is increasing the likelihood of men experiencing these life-changing side effects,” she added. “It is causing confusion and inconsistency between hospitals in how active surveillance is implemented across England, leading to a postcode lottery of overtreatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity is now repeating its call for Nice to update its guidance on active surveillance, claiming this could help up to 5,000 men a year avoid overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's National Screening Committee is currently assessing whether a national screening programme for prostate cancer should be rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NICE spokesperson said&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; “We are committed to ensuring our guidelines continue to reflect the best available evidence and give patients the best possible outcomes.

&lt;p&gt;New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reveals that women who regularly consume caffeinated coffee during midlife may have better chances of maintaining overall health into their senior years. This groundbreaking study tracked thousands of women over three decades, offering compelling evidence that your daily coffee ritual might contribute to long-term wellness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The remarkable connection between coffee and women’s healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a significant link between coffee consumption in middle-aged women and enhanced health outcomes later in life. The extensive research, presented at NUTRITION 2025 (the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting), followed 47,513 female participants from the Nurses’ Health Study over 30 years, gathering comprehensive dietary and health information since 1984.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sara Mahdavi, lead researcher from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Toronto, emphasized the unique aspect of this investigation: &lt;em&gt;examining coffee’s influence across multiple domains of aging over an extended timeframe&lt;/em&gt;. “While past studies have connected coffee to individual health outcomes, ours is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” Dr. Mahdavi explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that moderate consumption of caffeinated coffee—approximately 2-5 cups daily—was associated with a 2% to 5% higher likelihood of healthy aging. This positive correlation was specific to regular caffeinated coffee, with no significant benefits observed from decaffeinated varieties or tea consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women classified as “healthy agers” typically consumed about 315 mg of caffeine daily during midlife (ages 45-60), equivalent to three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards, &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01522-7/fulltext"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;. More than 80% of this caffeine came specifically from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What defines “healthy aging” in this landmark study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers established comprehensive criteria to identify women who achieved “healthy aging” status. By 2016, 3,706 participants had met all requirements. To qualify as a healthy ager, women needed to demonstrate excellence across multiple health domains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching age 70 or beyond&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Freedom from 11 major chronic diseases&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintained physical functionality&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Good mental health status&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No cognitive impairment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Absence of memory complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;holistic approach to measuring successful aging&lt;/strong&gt; represents one of the study’s most valuable contributions to our understanding of long-term health trajectories in women. Rather than focusing on single health metrics, the research team evaluated how coffee consumption related to maintaining overall wellbeing across physical, mental, and cognitive dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis carefully controlled for potential confounding factors, including body weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, educational background, and dietary protein intake—ensuring that the observed benefits could be reasonably attributed to caffeine consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not all caffeine sources offer equal benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crucial finding from this research highlights that &lt;strong&gt;the source of caffeine matters significantly&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to potential health benefits. While caffeinated coffee showed positive associations with healthy aging, the same cannot be said for all caffeine-containing beverages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Beverage Type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Association with Healthy Aging&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Approximate Effect&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Caffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Positive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-5% increased likelihood per cup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Decaffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cola/Soda&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20-26% decreased likelihood per serving&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most striking was the discovery that regular cola consumption showed a decidedly negative relationship with healthy aging prospects. Each additional small glass of soda was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that &lt;em&gt;the beneficial effects appear specific to coffee rather than caffeine itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction suggests that coffee’s unique composition—beyond just its caffeine content—may contribute to its apparent health benefits. Coffee contains numerous bioactive compounds, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances that could work synergistically to support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical implications for women’s health strategies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these findings show promise, Dr. Mahdavi cautions that coffee consumption should be viewed as just one component within a broader healthy lifestyle framework. “These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” she noted, adding that “moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledges that the benefits observed from coffee consumption were relatively modest compared to the impact of overall lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and avoiding tobacco use. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that incorporating moderate amounts of caffeinated coffee into daily routines may complement other health-promoting practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For middle-aged women concerned about maintaining their vitality and cognitive function into later years, this research offers encouraging evidence that your morning cup of coffee might do more than just jumpstart your day—it could potentially contribute to a healthier aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal nature of this study—following participants for three decades—provides particularly robust evidence for these associations, though further research remains necessary to fully understand the biological mechanisms involved and to determine whether similar benefits might extend to other demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Voles lacking oxytocin receptors took up to a week to develop preferences for peers that normal voles formed in a day, and they often failed to prioritize known companions in group settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These receptor-deficient voles also pressed less to access a peer and were less avoidant of strangers, indicating reduced social selectivity. The findings highlight oxytocin’s dual role in fostering affiliation with trusted companions and reinforcing boundaries with outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bond Formation Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin accelerates the development of selective friendships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Selectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Without oxytocin receptors, animals struggle to prioritize familiar peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Social Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin influences both closeness to friends and avoidance of strangers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new UC Berkeley study shows that the so-called love hormone, oxytocin, is also critical for the formation of friendships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is released in the brain during sex, childbirth, breastfeeding and social interactions and contributes to feelings of attachment, closeness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112162"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg" alt="This shows friends talking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in who they are social with, their selectivity,” she said. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never mind that it’s also associated with aggression; the hormone is commonly referred to as the “cuddle” or “happy” hormone, and people are encouraged to boost their oxytocin levels for better well-being by touching friends and loved ones, listening to music and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent studies involving the prairie vole have called this love association into question. They’ve shown that oxytocin, which in the brain acts as a neuromodulator, is not essential for long-term mate bonding, or “social monogamy,” or for parenting behavior, though without it, voles take longer to form such bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists focus on prairie voles because, like humans, they form stable and selective relationships. While most studies focus on mate bonds, the Beery lab at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in selective peer relationships, analogous to human friendships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies could shed light on human psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, that interfere with a person’s ability to form or maintain social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prairie voles are special because they allow us to get at the neurobiology of friendship and how it’s similar to and different from other types of relationships,” said Annaliese Beery, a UC Berkeley associate professor of integrative biology and neuroscience and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery and integrative biology graduate student Alexis Black, one of two first authors of the study, found that prairie voles that lack oxytocin receptors take longer than normal voles to form peer relationships. Prairie voles that are close friends typically huddle side by side, groom and even sit on one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oxytocin seems to be particularly important in the early formation phase of relationships and especially in the selectivity of those relationships: ‘I prefer you to this stranger,’ for example,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The animals that didn’t have intact oxytocin signaling took longer to form relationships. And then when we challenged those relationships by making new groups, they lost track of their original partners right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voles, genetically modified in the UC San Francisco laboratory of collaborator and co-author Dr. Devanand Manoli, also lacked the social rewards that normally come from selective attachments — they didn’t work very hard to snuggle up with their friends and were less avoidant of and less aggressive towards strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;they are social with, their selectivity,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking oxytocin receptors also changed the regulation of oxytocin availability and release in the brain, which the group documented using a novel oxytocin nanosensor in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Natsumi Komatsu and Markita Landry, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That helped us understand the feedback consequences of lacking this receptor, and how oxytocin signaling was altered in the brain,” said Beery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published Aug. 8 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What social voles tell us about social humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery has long been interested in social relationships in rodents, focusing primarily on the animals’ seldom-studied peer or friendship relationships. While voles are her main focus, she believes studying similar behaviors across multiple species is key to determining what’s species-specific versus generalizable across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complement her laboratory research, she has conducted field studies comparing social behavior and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain within and across species in a group of South American rodents and North American Belding’s ground squirrels, which vary in whether or not they live in groups. She also recently began field tests of multiple vole species — there are about 50 worldwide — to compare their social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suspects that in rodents such as voles, and perhaps in other mammals, the formation of peer relationships may have preceded the evolution of monogamous mating relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most rodents prefer to interact with unfamiliar individuals, it turns out that the majority of vole species we’ve tested in our early trials form peer-partner preferences, which is what we call these selective friendships. So there seems to be this widespread tendency to bond,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But only a couple of those species are also monogamous. Someday, I hope to be able to tell you, ‘Do selective peer relationships precede the development of monogamy? Is that why monogamy has evolved so many times in this genus?’ I think this familiarity preference is deeply rooted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery was a co-author of a 2023 study led by Manoli that threw into question the association of oxytocin with sex and parenting. That study showed that prairie voles unable to respond to oxytocin exhibit the same monogamous mating, attachment and parenting behaviors as regular voles. Those voles had been genetically engineered to have no cellular receptors for oxytocin, and were the same voles used in the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while oxytocin isn’t essential for eventual bond formation, additional studies by the same group published in 2024 showed that these receptor-deficient (or “null mutant”) prairie voles took about twice as long as normal voles to establish a relationship with a potential mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in how the lack of an oxytocin receptor affects voles’ friendship bonds, as opposed to mating bonds, Beery and Black conducted three sets of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one, they tested how long it took for voles to establish a preference for a partner. Whereas normal voles take about 24 hours of close proximity to form a relationship that makes them choose that partner over a stranger, oxytocin receptor-deficient voles showed no preference in that amount of time, and took up to a week to establish a peer preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wild-type animals form this incredibly robust preference within one day of co-housing, but the null mutants have no sign of a relationship after 24 hours. After a week, they mostly get there, and the lifetime partners look no different from each other,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our conclusion from that experiment is that oxytocin isn’t required to have a relationship, but it’s really important in those early phases of a relationship to facilitate it happening quickly and efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then put long-term pair-bonded voles in a party-like, mixed-group situation: an enclosure with other voles and many rooms connected by tubes. In such a situation, normal voles would hang out with known friends until they eventually started to socialize with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can all separate, they can all come together, or they can hang out in any combinations that they want,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The wild-type animals keep track of who they know. It’s like if I went to a party with a friend, I would stand near that friend for the first part of the party and then I might start to mingle. The voles that lack oxytocin receptors just mixed. It was as if they didn’t even have a partner in there with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third experiment, they tested the strength of both peer and mate bonding by having the voles press levers to get access to either a friend/mate or a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Female wild-type voles typically press more to get their partner than to get a stranger, in both peer and mate relationships. The oxytocin receptor deficient mutants also press more to get to their mating partner, but not for peer relationships,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes sense at some level because we think mate relationships are more rewarding than peer relationships, or at least they depend more on reward-signaling pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of oxytocin signaling thus not only delays the formation of relationships, but also creates deficits in long-term peer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, voles lacking oxytocin receptors were also less aggressive toward strangers and less avoidant of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can see contributions of oxytocin signaling to both sides of selectivity,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the prosocial side, it’s involved in wanting to be with a known friend or peer, while on the antisocial side, it’s aiding in rejecting an unfamiliar animal. We’ve seen effects of oxytocin on both affiliation and aggression in our other studies in prairie voles, and it parallels human findings on a role of oxytocin in in-group/out-group dynamics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin nanosensors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a new oxytocin sensor developed in Landry’s UC Berkeley lab to determine whether lack of an oxytocin receptor caused increases or decreases in oxytocin release. If oxytocin release increased in these voles, it could potentially interact with a receptor for a similar neuropeptide that is also involved in formation of social relationships, compensating for the absence of oxytocin receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landry, an associate professor in the departments of chemical and biomolecular engineering, neuroscience, and molecular and cell biology and a co-corresponding author of the paper, created these sensors from carbon nanotubes joined with specific single-stranded DNA sequences selected because they latch onto the oxytocin molecule and fluoresce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komatsu and Landry found no excess of oxytocin in the voles’ brains. In fact, oxytocin was being released in lower amounts from fewer sites in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for social reward across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Co-authors with Black, Komatsu, Beery, Landry and Manoli are Jiaxuan Zhao, Scarlet Taskey and Nicole Serrano of UC Berkeley, and Ruchira Sharma of UCSF.

Oxytocin receptor function also contributed to the maintenance of peer bonds, as &lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; voles displayed reduced relationship stability and lost selective attachments rapidly in a multi-chamber, group-living habitat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; voles also showed deficits in general social reward as well as selective social reward for a peer partner over an unfamiliar conspecific. Evoked oxytocin release in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in male and female &lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared with their wild-type counterparts, indicating that these voles do not have a compensatory increase in oxytocinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these data indicate that oxytocin receptors influence the formation, persistence, and reward value of peer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:31:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1XTnZTSmY0LVczX2tNUVZUZEpheE9Sb1JGN3d6b29ZQXlKc3JuVi1rQUZHVmpLQnY4Ym5wTDEtWHExbmIwbExDUmtocDNFLXNNeUsyRE5zVi1neDZGcnVsOHB6dEdfYjlKbnJxdnNhbFo</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.被医学杂志抨击疫苗研究撤回请求- The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRmh5Mmo1YldGNkczN2E4TkJqSms4SHowYnFDS0hIR3B0M3NCRkpoNGg3TTZhcm5ad2xEYzQzZktuNzNVRlhZTlFPa0JzT1VFTks5YlBsNVVvSVljNnduTkxWTmZvN3kwVGhOUUUxOWFYdlBxWlFPeDNwRnVsTHRDUUJhWWpaa3pwZ2YwWjJIdUR0VVctRWVMc3duTEVJSlItVWFTQ1UzU09VcEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="main-article" class=""&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The editor-in-chief of a prominent medical journal has rejected Robert F.

It was not clear where the other 33 cases were within the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials heralded the figures as the lowest weekly count reported since the peak of the outbreak in the week to July 20 to 26, when they said they recorded 2,940 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement to DailyMail.com last week, a CDC spokesman said: 'CDC is aware of the reported chikungunya outbreak in Guangdong Province in China and is currently assessing the size and extent of the outbreak.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency has already issued a level two warning for the area, advising Americans to take advanced precautions when traveling to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Friday, Hong Kong said it had detected another two cases linked to the outbreak, taking its chikungunya tally to five infections reported this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the area in China where US travelers are being advised to take extra precautions because of the outbreak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drones are being used to hunt down insect breeding grounds and spray insecticide (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One was a 66-year-old woman who was reported to have traveled to Foshan alone from July 24 to August 5 to see family, before returning to Hong Kong. The patient began suffering from fever, rash and joint pain on August 6 and went to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has now been discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reported another suspected case in a healthy 22-year-old woman who was suffering from joint pain and fever. She had recently traveled to Madagascar, Mauritius and Malaysia before returning to the territory, and reported having been bitten by mosquitoes during her trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also on Friday, Taiwan reported its first case linked to the outbreak in China, in a woman in her 40s who had recently returned from Foshan and Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A day after returning to Taiwan she developed a fever, rash and pain in her limbs. Officials said she was admitted to the hospital. She also reported being bitten by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya virus can only be spread via the bites of mosquitoes and cannot be passed from human to human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People infected with the virus suffer from a sudden high fever, normally around 103 Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), which happens within two to seven days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also suffer from a rash, headache, nausea, fatigue and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In serious cases, patients may suffer from pain in the hands and feet that is so bad it leaves them struggling to carry out normal activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is rarely fatal, but can leave people with lifelong complications including joint inflammation and pain that lasts for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who are very young, elderly or have underlying conditions are most at risk because of their weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for the virus, with doctors instead using over-the-counter painkillers, fluids and rest to ease symptoms. There are two vaccines available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US records more than 100 cases of chikungunya virus every year, with almost all normally linked to travelers returning from abroad before testing positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are concerned, however, that an infected individual could be bitten by a mosquito, which would then become infected and pass the disease on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A total of 45 chikungunya cases have been reported in the US this year, although none have been linked to the outbreak in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:02:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZFhZVDN1ZHdycDdBMTFqVDNQTTNNWlY3ZmI0X1pNc1dHQ05LRFQtOVNzbVNPWHJGSGdCRW5ONEhsSWxkWDFfTGQ5a0dYX1VNZzZCeE9weEdJS3VUTkdKMWJQeGlYblBHWWhhLUREanJQUDlJREVBbUtTck03Q29IVVFsUXhlMUUtRkpEX1RNenNsNDV4dnRwSTRYWmdQdlgydUtJ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE5TS0dwUFlOZURqMm1SbzVNTkxUUlVIRmJQaUlubnN2MkNrdzA4TWVwM3ktamxJV1QxYVlKZnRRXzF3TDFxMllHejF5eXBiMVBFZlE0ODhFQTlVTERDOXBQVlFyX2M2clhVbzNfZTREM1pTM09MLXpaNG8zMnN4MVJLbHJfXzlUOGRMS1h4eHZaOTRuNEJ1QVJ4eGZMQW9fMU9jQTZmQ19icw</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic如何影响肌肉力量：研究-德撒律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQbk5XOUNsMmVJMFhFZng3emQ1TVp5WFFZZHBsMnAySEExMzBvQmlhbmtrM05QUTdZcHR0cDdMVlJjWS0wRUlMZlJaRmh6dWJIMTgzV0JoajNHMWJrb2l1c3pxMGVxU2k0bkJxbnVRN2VhcGFnYjFwcXdmY0g3a1Zjd1h1aXkwRzhjYWY5ekNiZUxDNl95VWRwS19Hbkc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A recently completed study indicated potential muscle weakness caused by Ozempic and similar drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such drugs still have significant health benefits like controlling blood sugar and helping people lose weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question is whether some people who use Ozempic are more susceptible to losing muscle strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Mice aren’t people, but they have a lot in common with humans genetically. And the furry rodents are often used in preliminary studies to help answer questions about where human research should go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For University of Utah researchers, a recently completed mouse study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413125003316%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413125003316%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt; suggests the need to look more closely at whether the popular drug Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs could cause muscle weakness that needs to be addressed for those taking the medications to manage diabetes or lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers hail the medications as a “significant breakthrough in pharmacological interventions to treat obesity.” But they note recent concerns that Ozempic and similar drugs cause “a loss of lean mass, potentially compromising physical function and quality of life, particularly in those susceptible to sarcopenia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength and function associated with age. But there are also medical conditions that could lead to worries about weakened muscles, too, the study’s senior author, Katsu Funai, an associate professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah College of Health, told Deseret News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The goal is not to downplay the importance of how Ozempic and related drugs can improve health by controlling blood sugar or causing weight loss, he added. But his team wants to point out that measures might be needed to protect against a potential negative side effect. If further study shows that a drug leads to weaker muscles — especially in a population that might be susceptible already to losing strength — then those folks might need tandem interventions that maintain or build muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Funai said that besides age, recent surgeries, disabilities and other conditions might increase the risk of losing muscle strength. And quality of life is very much affected by muscle loss, which can lead to falls, injuries and inactivity, impacting overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="What-the-Ozempic-study-found" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What the Ozempic study found&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s generally assumed that loss of lean muscle leads to loss of muscle mass and weaker muscles. That may not be as straightforward as some believe. The university-led research found those losing weight with Ozempic also lost about 10% of lean mass, though not necessarily from skeletal muscles, but from tissue such as the liver, which shrank a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Loss of mass in metabolically active organs, such as the liver, is expected as part of healthy weight loss,” Ran Hee Choi, research instructor in nutrition and integrative physiology at University Health and co-first author on the study, said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But both mice and humans can see organ size change alongside weight without a similar change in function. “It’s unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect,” said Takuya Karasawa, postdoctoral researcher in the University of Utah Molecular Medicine Program and co-first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But size of muscles and strength are very different things, Funai said. And loss of lean mass is not the same as muscle loss or its strength, either. The researchers found that even when a muscle stayed the same size, it in some cases lost strength, while in other muscles that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;What isn’t known — and needs to be studied, Funai said — is whether weight loss can lead to loss of muscle strength in some people and, if so, who would be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Funai emphasized again that their work in mice raises questions, but does not necessarily apply directly to humans. For one thing, as the study notes, rodents and people gain and lose weight differently. People with obesity are often less physically active, while having obesity doesn’t usually make mice more sedentary. And the mice were given obesity through a high-fat diet for the study, while people have many different reasons for weight gain, including genetics, diet, sleep patterns and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Funai said it is very common for people to not realize they have lost strength in their muscles, but when it’s tested, the loss is clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When they’re opening a jar or when they have to do flights of stairs that they don’t usually do or have to carry something, then they might notice. It’s something that they may not be aware of” otherwise, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He added that the loss of muscle mass and loss of muscle strength were dose dependent and time dependent, meaning that how long and how much Ozempic was given mattered. And the dose that was higher and where loss was more sustained was higher than would be given to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It was noteworthy that loss of muscle mass and loss of force or strength weren’t always coupled and that fact was not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study points out the need for clinical trials that directly look at whether muscle strength is lost and if so, in which populations, Funai said. And those studies should consider not just Ozempic and other semaglutide weight-loss drugs, but those in development, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While studies frequently consider lean mass loss, physical function is an important issue that may not be so straightforward, he said. But it’s critically important for those who may be vulnerable to losing strength and gaining associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:51:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQbk5XOUNsMmVJMFhFZng3emQ1TVp5WFFZZHBsMnAySEExMzBvQmlhbmtrM05QUTdZcHR0cDdMVlJjWS0wRUlMZlJaRmh6dWJIMTgzV0JoajNHMWJrb2l1c3pxMGVxU2k0bkJxbnVRN2VhcGFnYjFwcXdmY0g3a1Zjd1h1aXkwRzhjYWY5ekNiZUxDNl95VWRwS19Hbkc</guid></item></channel></rss>
