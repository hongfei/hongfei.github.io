Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/20/stroke-and-dementia-risk-linked-to-low-sugar-drinks-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies have suggested&lt;/a&gt; they may increase the risk of a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart problems, depression and dementia, and damage the gut wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sweeteners’ association with cognitive decline is of such concern that consumers should instead use either tagatose, a natural sweetener, or alternatives such as honey or maple syrup, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They looked at the impact of seven sweeteners on the health of the study’s participants – 12,772 civil servants in Brazil, with an average age of 52 – who were followed up for on average eight years. Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found. This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with cognitive loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0b34376c-0b9b-4031-aa4e-43716e0f0780" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘No place in children’s hands’: under-16s in England to be banned from buying energy drinks","elementId":"0b34376c-0b9b-4031-aa4e-43716e0f0780","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60. That shows that middle-aged adults need to be encouraged to use fewer sweeteners, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The sweeteners studied are also found in flavoured water, low-calorie desserts and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Low and no-calorie sweeteners are often seen as a healthy alternative to sugar. However, our findings suggest certain sweeteners may have negative effects on brain health over time,” said Claudia Kimie Suemoto, of the University of São Paulo in Brazil, the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Food and drink industry bodies cast doubt on the findings. “By the authors’ own admission, this study cannot prove cause,” said Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Non-sugar sweeteners are safe, according to all leading health authorities in the world, and that’s why they have been used in a vast array of food, medicine, dental and drinks products for many decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Their use in soft drinks has helped UK manufacturers to remove just under three-quarters of a billion kilograms of sugar from product since 2015.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) said there was an “established scientific consensus” that sweeteners are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This research is an observational study, which can only show a statistical association, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship,” the ISA said in a statement. “The reported link between sweetener consumption and cognitive decline does not prove that one causes the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 20:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPRG5hTVlnZUxzYUVXekhubWhZR2FmV1h1UWV4bmFzblN5c0c3MnAyTWozXzlYekc2b3ZGRERCTDluV2VUMlRlR1pfREx3X0VaNnlwMGlMUWViYU9DbDBOY0o0emktRmdmTERISlhNU1Bua0pvRjIycmFJZWVoODJtSDVraUs4clhUeTJfZWwwTkNXOTlLNDM5QV80eXlOSWVSNjRPZGlPa0FXWDBmN2hodTZHcEllMVo2TUF6RmRjWVpRNGFw</guid></item><item><title>8例西尼罗河病毒人类病例— 1例死亡—在犹他州戴维斯县检测到- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51369657/8-human-cases-of-west-nile-virus--1-death--detected-in-utah-davis-counties</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROVO — Two county health departments in Utah are reporting more human cases of West Nile virus on Wednesday, including one that led to the death of a Davis County resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department said it has seen three reported cases of West Nile virus with two of those cases being neuroinvasive West Nile virus, a more severe form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of the Davis County individuals who contracted neuroinvasive West Nile virus were hospitalized, with one dying from the disease. No other information was provided about the person who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Utah County Health Department confirmed five cases of West Nile virus in humans in the county. Of those five cases, four are neuroinvasive West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between the high number of positive mosquito pools and multiple human cases with symptoms, it is clear that West Nile virus is actively being detected across Utah County," said a release from the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest cases come on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51361247" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;three other human cases&lt;/a&gt; of West Nile virus reported in Salt Lake and Cache counties in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Utah County Mosquito Abatement crews are conducting additional assessments and have begun applying "targeted treatments" in neighborhoods where the five cases were identified, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These enhanced efforts are intended to reduce mosquito populations and lower the risk of transmission," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Davis County Health Department states that individuals over 60 and those with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of illness from West Nile, but anyone can contract the illness from the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent contracting West Nile, the Utah County Health Department advises people to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always use insect repellent when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves, pants and socks at dawn and dusk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate standing water around the home, as mosquitoes can breed in just a few days in small containers, buckets, bird baths, flowerpots or clogged gutters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep doors and windows screened and repair any holes or tears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take extra caution if you are older or immunocompromised and at higher risk for severe illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

This included the levels of proteins, individual amino acids, fatty acids, vitamin D and all B–vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, they found that plant–based diets, when properly formulated, can be a reasonable alternative to meat–based options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritional composition of meat and plant–based foods for dogs were similar, except for iodine and B–vitamins, which were lower in plant–based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said adopting a vegan diet for canine companions can provide adequate nutrients, but that supplements should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many of us assume that dogs need meat to stay healthy, but in fact, what they really need are the right nutrients,' Ms Brociek added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What I found was surprising – these foods stacked up more closely to meat–based diets than expected, with all showing some nutritional gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With more studies on plant–based pet foods emerging every year, I'm excited to help move this conversation forward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Giving your dog a chunk of meat – or even a bone to chew on – might soon be a thing of the past, according to a new study (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of self–declared vegans in the UK has rocketed in recent years, and quadrupled between 2014 and 2019, from 150,000 to 600,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328506"&gt;Plos One&lt;/a&gt;, reads: 'Veganism is increasingly becoming a popular dietary choice for many people, whether it be for health reasons or concerns for animal welfare and/or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Owners of companion animals, who identify as vegetarian or vegan, therefore face an ethical dilemma – should they feed animals to their animals?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It concludes: 'Adopting a plant–based dietary pattern for your companion canine can provide nutritional adequacy with respect to the majority of macro– and micronutrients, with the exception of iodine and B–vitamins, which could easily be supplemented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-c664d480-88aa-11f0-bba3-dda1b22e7a7c"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-2ef77710-009f-11e8-9256-2f90a6e0b8af" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-5304177/SCIENTISTS-REVEAL-DOG-ENJOYS-SCARFING-ITS.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team of scientists from University of California at Davis surveyed thousands of dog owners to figure out why dogs are drawn to eating their own and other dogs' poo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it has nothing to do with breed, age, or training, they did discover that dogs are more likely to eat poop when there are multiple dogs in one home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dogs are also more likely to eat poop if they're considered 'greedy eaters.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, the impetus for the disgusting behaviour likely has something to do with their wolf ancestors, which ate fresh poop before it became infected with parasites as a way to clean up any droppings left around their dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Don't expect a pill to help prevent poop eating any time soon, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found that food additives and other techniques have no success at preventing dogs from scarfing down faeces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sitting on an open bowl offers no support for the pelvic floor. That puts pressure on veins in the rectum, making them swollen and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2948d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The longer you sit on the toilet, the worse it is for you,” said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institute for Gut-Brain Research Institute in Boston. Pasricha is also an author of the study, which was &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday in PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d81198" class="body-graf"&gt;And smartphones are designed to keep people fixated for as long as possible. “They’re completely consuming to us in ways that wasn’t happening to the casual bathroom reader in the 80s,” Pasricha said. “They could much more easily put the newspaper down and get up and leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9617e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and colleagues surveyed 125 adults just before they were about to have a routine colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52fe29" class="body-graf"&gt;Eighty-three (66%) of the participants admitted to using their phones in the bathroom — mostly to catch up on news of the day and scroll through social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-525b28" class="body-graf"&gt;Gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopies looked for evidence of inflamed veins, or hemorrhoids. People who said they took their phone into the bathroom were 46% more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to the others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d0d65" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk remained even when researchers accounted for other factors associated with hemorrhoids, including dietary fiber, exercise and constipation or straining while using the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf00d2" class="body-graf"&gt;Hemorrhoids aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they can be bothersome, itchy and even painful. They also bleed sometimes, understandably causing concern and leading to nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(18)30275-1/fulltext/" target="_blank"&gt;4 million doctor’s office and emergency department visits&lt;/a&gt; a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-294985" class="body-graf"&gt;Over time, “pelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to incontinence, worsen constipation and be associated with rectal pain,” said Dr. Reezwana Chowdhury, an inflammatory bowel disorder specialist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Taking a phone into the bathroom, Chowdhury said, “is kind of gross.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a61c3" class="body-heading"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7c2ae" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, smartphone users in the bathroom tended to be younger, meaning adults in their 40s and 50s, versus people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca875c" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Cima, a colorectal surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said he’s noticed an uptick in recent years of people coming in with hemorrhoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff0ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am seeing younger, earlier- and middle-aged people having more hemorrhoidal complaints, but I can’t tie it to smartphones,” said Cima, who was not involved with the new study. “Maybe it’s because they’re using smartphones or they have better access to care or they’re not eating appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3b112d" class="body-heading"&gt;The 5-minute rule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-400844" class="body-graf"&gt;The experts agreed that business on the toilet should take no longer than 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-866a13" class="body-graf"&gt;More than 37% of study participants who used a smartphone in the bathroom stayed for longer than that, compared to 7% of people who kept their phones out of the bathroom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bffb" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and other experts do not advocate for taking a phone into the bathroom.

            There’s nothing like shutting the bathroom door, maybe even locking it and hiding away from one’s family, even just for a few minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000m3b6n534k5eyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The toilet has long been a sanctuary to catch up on some light reading and, for the harried parent, a spot for some rare “me time.” But the amount of toilet time has become a more pressing medical issue as people shift from reading physical books and magazines to endlessly scrolling on their smartphones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000n3b6n01ob0u90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are consequences to sitting longer than we used to on the toilet: People are reporting a higher rate of hemorrhoids when they bring their smartphones to the bathroom, according to &lt;a href="http://plos.io/4mufrh" target="_blank"&gt;a new study in PLOS One.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000o3b6nxj2qx79w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids" target="_blank"&gt;Hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt; are groups of veins in the rectum and outside the anus that can swell and enlarge due to increased pressure, which can create itchiness, discomfort, pain and bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000p3b6ntmvzja6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new research provides concrete evidence of what many have long suspected: People lose track of time in the bathroom when they have their phones, said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, the study’s senior author, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000q3b6nkxmrwzhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All this scrolling is messing with people’s health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000r3b6nfojltjku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The entire business model of these social media apps is to distract us, make us lose track of time and addict us to the algorithm,” Pasricha said. “We’re just now understanding how much smartphones impact lots of other factors in our lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000s3b6n7jwwf14q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study invited 125 adults undergoing a screening colonoscopy to complete a survey on their toilet habits, including whether they scroll online in the bathroom. The survey also asked questions about straining, fiber intake and exercise routines — additional factors involved in hemorrhoid risk. Confirmation of hemorrhoids was detected by endoscopy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000t3b6n6b3wwoj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported regularly using their smartphones on the toilet. Those who did spent significantly more time on the loo than people who left their smartphones outside the bathroom. About 54% of respondents reported using their phones to read news, while about 44% spent their time on social media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000u3b6nwzle3qkx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How much did mindless scrolling on the toilet affect hemorrhoid risk? Researchers found regular smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46% greater risk of having hemorrhoids. About 37% of smartphone users spend over five minutes on the toilet compared with 7% of non-smartphone users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000v3b6nebdgwnea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hemorrhoids are often associated with prolonged sitting; however, the risk is higher when sitting for too long on a toilet. The open toilet seat compresses the rectal area, keeping your bottom in a lower position than if you were sitting on a chair. Over time, the increased pressure from the toilet seat can cause blood to pool in the rectum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000w3b6n4gi170u3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re sitting on an open toilet bowl, you have no pelvic floor support,” Pasricha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000x3b6nb42hvdax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Along with spending more time sitting, using a smartphone on the toilet may increase the risk of hemorrhoids due to poor posture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne9000y3b6nj3onxtqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Hima Ghanta, a colorectal surgeon at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said people tend to hunch when looking down at their phones, which isn’t ideal for excretion because the rectum and anus curve from the colon. The squatted position is a better option for a smooth bowel movement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “People way back who had to squat did not tend to have as many issues, but because we changed the angle we’re evacuating and sitting longer, these are exacerbating factors for hemorrhoids,” Ghanta said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900103b6n5ija0pmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about constipation? The study results suggest the issue is most likely the time spent sitting on the toilet rather than straining, Pasricha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900113b6n42c023l2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who used their smartphones weren’t more constipated than those who didn’t, she said. “They didn’t actually strain harder to have a bowel movement than the ones who didn’t. My hypothesis is that it’s passive smartphone use that causes these hemorrhoidal cushions to become engorged and bulge, and that’s what leads to hemorrhoids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900123b6n4xamkbh6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study involved only adults 45 years and older, Pasricha said the results can also apply to younger people, as they are the most likely to always carry their phones with them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900133b6nsa4ywk1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was helpful to have this (45 and older) group because there were people who didn’t use their smartphones on the toilet. So we had a comparison group,” Pasricha explained. “Having a third of people not bringing their smartphones to the bathroom helped us understand what a baseline could look like, especially as I imagine the situation is more profound for younger individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900143b6n5vconroi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sandhya Shukla, a gastroenterologist at Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology Associates in New Jersey who was not involved in the study, said she is seeing younger patients diagnosed with hemorrhoid issues. Though other factors, such as low fiber intake and obesity, can explain why this is happening, she said that scrolling mindlessly on the toilet is one of the major contributors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900153b6nv0i3giz0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The simplest answer is to avoid bringing your phone to the bathroom. If you do bring it, however, all the doctors recommend limiting your sitting time. Gastroenterologists previously advised people to spend no more than 10 minutes sitting on the toilet. Three to five minutes would be ideal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900163b6n9k78tnn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of expert consensus is three minutes per bowel movement, but everyone is different,” Shukla said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900173b6ngtoe82ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Setting a timer can be helpful if you’re prone to mindless scrolling. Pasricha also recommended checking in with yourself after two TikTok videos to see whether you’re having a productive toilet session. If the magic isn’t happening, it’s better to get up and try again later than to sit and wait on the toilet bowl.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf43bne900183b6nvm8jc1e1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghanta explained it best: There are many things in life we’re rushing to get through, and we often say to slow down and take time to smell the roses. But not on the toilet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="gt-block"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a victim of sleep disorder, you might be in luck—an expert may have solved the mystery of why you can't sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep scientists have long suggested banning technology before bed, avoiding caffeine, and sticking to a fixed schedule every night as three simple ways to combat insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But now, a sleep researcher at Royal Holloway University of London has claimed that these are not the most effective ways to get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Kirsty Vant, five common habits can make insomnia even worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When sleep doesn't come, the temptation is to go to bed earlier or stay up longer in the morning to "compensate."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But this strategy often backfires,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The more time you spend awake in bed, the more you weaken the mental association between bed and sleep—and strengthen the association between bed and frustration,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, people should go to bed a little later and wake up at the same time every morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This strengthens sleep pressure—the body’s natural desire for sleep—and reframes bed as a signal for sleep, not wakefulness,” she told The Conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867041" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg 798w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-437x300.jpg 437w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-184x126.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, scientists often advise avoiding screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a natural hormone that plays a key role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of lighting can create strong contrasts and shadows, which are tiring to the eyes, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, disrupting the natural calming process and contributing to physical and mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, “lying in the dark with nothing to engage your mind can create the perfect storm for anxiety and overthinking, both of which fuel insomnia,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of banning screens altogether, use them strategically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choose calming, non-stimulating content, use 'night mode' options, and avoid mindlessly scrolling through pages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if people are sensitive to caffeine, it is "wise" to avoid it later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Removing it completely “is not always necessary,” she advised. “Understanding your individual response is key.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a recent sleep survey, around one in nine women in the UK—approximately 4.5 million—use a sleep/health app or device, such as a smartwatch, to track their sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sleep pattern is presented in the app with diagrams showing minutes spent in the three stages of sleep—light, deep, and REM—with warnings if users don't reach their target hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the “overwhelming effort to optimize sleep” is fueling rising cases of insomnia and orthosomnia—the obsession with sleeping “right,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867042" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg 793w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-499x300.jpg 499w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-768x462.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-184x111.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Sleep is an autonomic function, like digestion or blood pressure. While we can influence sleep through healthy habits, we can't force it to happen. Obsessing over sleep quality can paradoxically worsen it," she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, the best approach is to worry less about sleep—and let your body do what it's designed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even expecting to sleep a fixed number of hours each night can increase the risk of insomnia, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Expecting rigid consistency from sleep creates unrealistic expectations. Some nights will be better than others—and that’s normal. Healthy sleep is not a fixed number of hours—it’s dynamic and responsive to our lives. Factors like stress, physical health, age, environment, even parental responsibilities all affect sleep,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insomnia is common and treatable—and no, it’s not your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People often need about 10 to 20 minutes to fall asleep after turning off the lights, according to the Sleep Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, a study found that around one in six Britons suffer from insomnia, but 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey of 2,000 people, conducted by The Sleep Charity, found that nine out of ten people experience some kind of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behavior when they can't sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, stroke and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which is estimated to affect up to 14 million Britons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, sleep deprivation has its own consequences—from irritability and short-term lack of focus, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. /GazetaExpress/&lt;/p&gt;

This lack of regard for safety is often seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And female mice showed signs of memory problems when it came to recognizing familiar objects or completing mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe these behaviors mimic tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease in humans, as men with the disease more likely to be indifferent or unmotivated while women have more memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggests that even being exposed to microplastics for a few weeks could cause lasting damage. And the latest research shows &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622989/How-cancer-causing-microplastics-body-based-age.html"&gt;nearly all Americans have detectable levels of the chemicals in their bodies&lt;/a&gt;, with exposure starting in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at the University of Rhode Island found exposure to microplastics may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease in mice (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jaime Ross, study author and professor of neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/02/alzheimers-symptoms-microplastics-mice-study/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'I'm still really surprised by it. I just can't believe that you are exposed to these particles and something like this can happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly 7million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of memory-robbing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, about one in 14 people develop the disease by age 65, and one in three are diagnosed by 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae"&gt;Environmental Research Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at mice who were genetically modified to have the APOE4 mutation, which triples the risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in four Americans have the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the gene on its own significantly increases risk, the researchers caution it does not guarantee developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said: 'If you are carrying APOE4, it doesn't mean you're going to develop Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't want to scare anybody. But it is the largest known risk factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly all Americans have been exposed to microplastics, which seep into vital organs and cause untold damage (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice in the study were also exposed to polystyrene microplastics for three weeks in their drinking water. The microplastics were between 0.1 and two micrometers in diameter, which is a fraction of the width of a human hair strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the exposure period, the researchers conducted behavioral testing, such as maze puzzles and object recognition. In one portion, mice were put in a square pen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said healthy mice will generally stick to corners and avoid open spaces for safety reasons, but male mice with the APOE4 mutation who were exposed to microplastics tended to drift toward the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This showed a general lack of motivation or regard for safety, which is common in men with Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Female mice did not show the same behavior, but they did have memory issues and trouble remembering familiar objects significantly more than female mice who weren't exposed to microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also struggled to get through mazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ross said: 'There were very similar sex differences in mice as what people experience.'  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are unsure exactly why microplastics raise the risk of Alzheimer's-like behaviors, but repeated exposure has been shown to increase oxidative stress, an imbalance of harmful molecules called free radicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxidative stress induces inflammation and damages cells, including those responsible for memory and executive function, which could increase the risk of Alzheimer's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics can also cross the blood-brain barrier and block blood vessel function, causing brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that because the study was done in mice, it's unclear if humans would suffer the same effects.

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s some potential good news for runners or people fresh off knee surgery: Your creaking knees might not indicate deeper health issues. New research finds that knee creaking is not associated with a greater risk of arthritis in people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists at La Trobe University in Australia led the study, which examined the long-term outcomes of young patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Though people with knee creaking did experience more pain on average in the first year following surgery, they ultimately fared no worse than people without creaky knees years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that creaky knees might not be a reliable predictor of future arthritis, even in people healing from traumatic injuries, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A noisy universal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a snap, crackle, and pop knee is formally known as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/osteoarthritis/crepitus"&gt;knee crepitus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a common condition, &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(24)00414-X/fulltext"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to affect about 41% of the general public. While people of all ages can have knee crepitus, including people who aren’t experiencing any pain, studies have shown it’s especially common in people with osteoarthritis. That’s led some doctors to argue that crepitus should be seen as a clear early warning signal of arthritis in high-risk groups, including knee surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test out this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 112 young patients (median age 28) who had their ACL repaired. Following surgery, the participants’ knee health was tracked for five years, which included people’s self-assessment of relevant symptoms like knee pain and crepitus; the participants also received an MRI of their knee one year and five years after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Creaking but not broken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though people with crepitus did have a tougher time at first, things eventually balanced out for both groups, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We found that those with knee crepitus demonstrated more than two and a half times greater rates of full-thickness cartilage defects in the kneecap area, with more pain and poorer function early on,” said lead author Jamon Couch, a physical therapist and graduate researcher at La Trobe, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-noisy-knees-early-arthritis.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “But over the next four years, those with crepitus did not experience worse pain and function compared to those without knee crepitus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with ruptured ACLs are at higher long-term risk for osteoarthritis in general. So the findings, &lt;a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25637"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Arthritis Care and Research, should provide some reassurance that having creaky knees isn’t a sure-fire predictor for later issues, the researchers say, particularly in younger people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ACL patients specifically, there are other reasons to believe knee creaking on its own shouldn’t be seen as a major concern for the average person. A review last year by the same authors &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39375004/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 36% of people without knee pain experience crepitus, for instance, just a smidge below the percentage seen in the overall public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts do &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/by-itself-knee-crunching-sound-generally-not-cause-for-concern/"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people who have other knee symptoms besides crepitus, such as pain or swelling, should consider seeing a doctor to have it checked out. There’s also a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/knee-exercises-for-runners/"&gt;strengthening exercises&lt;/a&gt; out there that can help you improve or maintain your knee health, especially if you run. And being active in general is good for your joints.&lt;/p&gt;

Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;White House abruptly fired the CDC director&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Susan Monarez, claiming that she did not “&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5474649-white-house-cdc-susan-monarez-firing/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMfM6ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFNa1ZudVFBUXNMU21HdVRqAR6if960QcJ-bTsx9bVdOwWvXmr2Kxk7Ghmq5coD4SiGJ9ktdMvrSKAHr456CA_aem_ADunaI9vqjdotZgT18EJLA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;align&lt;/a&gt;” with Donald Trump’s agenda. She also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-administration-news-today-latest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; clashed with Kennedy over vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her ousting triggered the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-rally-staffers-protest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;resignations&lt;/a&gt; of several other senior CDC officials, including Dr Demetre Daskalakis, the former head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent interview, Daskalakis even &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5478469-rfk-jr-has-never-been-briefed-by-cdc-experts-on-measles-covid-19-or-flu-former-official-says/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said that&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy has never been briefed by CDC experts on several health issues including measles, Covid-19 or the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“No one from my center has ever briefed him on any of those topics,” Daskalakis told &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/politics/video/cdc-leaders-resign-rfk-jr-src-digvid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “Perhaps he has alternate experts that he may trust more than the experts at CDC that the rest of the world regards as the best scientists in the areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He’s getting information from somewhere, but that information is not coming from CDC experts who really are the world’s experts in this area … and he’s not taking us up on several offers to brief him on these very important topics,” Daskalakis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Wednesday morning, more than 1,000 current and former HHS employees signed a public &lt;a href="https://www.savehhs.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; demanding Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The letter accused Kennedy of putting US public health at risk and criticized his role in firing Monarez.

In that letter, the staffers accused him of fueling harassment and violence directed at government healthcare staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite the mounting pressure, Kennedy did not address Monarez’s firing, the subsequent resignations or the growing calls for his resignation in his editorial this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Kennedy defended the Trump administration’s role in what he described as “restoring public trust” in the CDC, which he argued had been “corroded” in recent years by “bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy, who previously founded an anti-vaccine group, also criticized the CDC’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, calling it a “failure”, and blasted policies such as social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, and “the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-presidents-2026-health-care-agenda" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to testify before the Senate finance committee on Thursday for a hearing on Trump’s healthcare agenda, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/ahead-of-rfk-jr-appearance-before-finance-committee-wyden-demands-end-to-secrecy-and-stonewalling-at-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;committee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSEhEU3M0aUgzdHR2LXR3NDNMNnNSNzZXUWJJeWM5Nk5XTWI5SE9Fek9ETXBiMDFyZmliVklrYUJldTl4N2VFaUxPVVAxbjZzaHF0SFc2ZG1IcHo0bkViZVJITW5iVTNkWWNsTGM1RmR3TzNwZmpXZ1dOOEZsU2cweFpRY19GYW1CRlE</guid></item><item><title>性塑造双相情感障碍和精神分裂症的进程-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/schizophrenia-bipolar-sex-differences-29656/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large multicenter study has revealed that sex influences the course and characteristics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

For example, females in the schizophrenia group were older than males at first outpatient treatment compared with females in the bipolar disorder group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, those who were older at first outpatient treatment presented a longer duration of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding substance use, the highest rates were observed in males with schizophrenia.

Results from the PsyCourse Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0001-title"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are serious mental illnesses (SMI) with overlapping symptoms but distinct differences in onset and course. Sex differences are an area of growing interest in SMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to examine potential interactions between sex and diagnosis across a broad range of variables, to compare males and females within SZ and BD, and to investigate sex-specific group differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1516 individuals were included in a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the multicenter PsyCourse Study, including BD (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 543), SZ (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 517), and healthy controls (HC) (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 456).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, psychosocial functioning, quality of life, neurocognitive performance, and somatic comorbidities were assessed. Generalized linear models were used to analyze differences between groups and sexes. False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant interactions were identified in age (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001), age at treatment (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05), illness duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03), illicit drug use (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01), and smoking (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.05). Differences in substance use were observed across groups and sexes, with the highest rates found in males with SZ. The BD group showed better functioning and neurocognitive performance compared with the SZ group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the BD group, females reported better performance in verbal memory (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) and psychomotor speed (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than males. Moreover, both females and males with SMI showed higher rates of thyroid alterations compared with HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01 for females and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002 for males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acps70026-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant sex differences were observed in substance use and somatic comorbidities. Interactions between diagnosis and sex underscore the importance of considering both factors in clinical assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need to tailor sex-specific treatment for each patient. Further research is needed to explore the role of sex hormones and other biological and societal factors in the presentation and course of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:57:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9tMS1MN1NyRTAxWnVtTUsyVzJsc1Zya0MwSmRaYnRDTmh6bjFwMlZrQy1weTE4RElzSk1PX2ZrQU1JV0djQ2k0bUtKVGFKS2VDWW92bVFSMXFtazV3REw0Mm5hNUFWUWE5MTJsZ0g0MEV6Slg2dkhmbUgyY2ZFdw</guid></item><item><title>研究人员指出可以在诊断前几年预测痴呆症的新症状- dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15060917/Early-senseory-symptom-dementia-years-diagnosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing your sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs that you're developing dementia, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The memory-robbing illness, which affects the lives of millions, causes problems with memory, language and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But changes to our senses—which occur years before the devastating illness is formally diagnosed and appear to be unconnected—could be a key warning sign we are developing the life-shattering disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The German researchers found that this is because the immune system attacks vital nerve fibres linked to detecting scent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team looked at mice, as well as PET brain scans in living patients and post-mortem tissues from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-26a8fec0-88ab-11f0-8195-0fec413e30af" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice, they found early damage to the nerve fibres that link the olfactory bulb—the brain's scent hub—to the locus coeruleus that aids sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the PET scans confirmed the same pathway observed in the rodents was disrupted in living human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, the brain tissue samples from deceased Alzheimer's patients revealed the chemical changes that trick the immune system into destroying the fibres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fresh study suggests loss of sense of smell could be one of the earliest signs of dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say these consistent &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62500-8#Sec10"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt;, which were published in the journal Nature Communications, strongly show that losing your sense of smell is an early sign of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jochen Herms of the University of Munich said: 'Our findings could pave the way for earlier identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, he explained could 'enable them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An early diagnosis for dementia is considered critical, as while the condition is incurable, treatments can combat symptoms and sometimes slow progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, other researchers &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798359/signs-dementia-memory-sensory-changes.html"&gt;found &lt;/a&gt;changes in sight, hearing, taste, touch and balance also strike years before more well-known symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned that problems with spatial awareness—for instance, standing too close to people—are also potential dementia warning signs which can occur up to twenty years before typical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Classic symptoms of dementia include issues with memory, thinking speed, mental sharpness and quickness, language, understanding, judgement and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of  dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs—which include the lost earnings of unpaid carers—are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis by Alzheimer's Research UK found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fresh findings follow research published just days ago that revealed a sense of purpose can lower your risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American scientists who published their findings in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry followed more than 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people with ah higher sense of purpose in life were 8 per cent less likely to develop cognitive impairment—including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protective effect was seen even when factors like race, ethnicity, education, genetics and depression are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,' said Aliza Wingo, lead author of the study, and professor at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found those with higher purpose experienced cognitive decline on average 1.4 months later than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“No matter what happens with [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] and the federal government, we are going to make sure vaccines remain available in Massachusetts,” Healey said in a statement Wednesday. “We are working to ensure that all pharmacies make the vaccine available as soon as possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Healey has also touted the state as a leader in an effort to create a regional public health collaboration with other Northeast states, including every New England state except New Hampshire, that would rely on medical societies rather than the CDC for guidance in establishing vaccination policies. On Wednesday, California, Washington, and Oregon announced the creation of a similar “health alliance” to shape immunization policies for those three states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of vaccine skepticism and peddling false information, has upended  the CDC since entering office and has pushed policies that are at odds with  scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, an independent board that advises the CDC on vaccine policy, and replacing them with less qualified people, many of whom share his anti-vaccine or vaccine skeptical ideology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Removing children and pregnant women from the CDC’s immunization schedule for COVID. An independent review this month found young unvaccinated children are vulnerable to serious illness from COVID, and newborns can inherit meaningful immune protections from mothers who get COVID shots while carrying babies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Canceling $500 million in federal funding to research new mRNA vaccines and treatments. MRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna saved millions of lives during the  pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recommending thimerosal, a preservative, be removed from all vaccines. The CDC’s&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html"&gt; own web site&lt;/a&gt; states thimerosal, used in some flu vaccine, is not harmful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last week, he fired the CDC’s director for refusing to fire top officials or rubber stamp decisions from  his hand-picked advisory committee. Three high-level CDC officials resigned in protest, warning that Kennedy had compromised the agency’s credibility. They warned that Kennedy appeared poised to move beyond COVID vaccines to restrict access to immunizations more widely. Wednesday, more than 1,000 current and former CDC staffers urged Kennedy to resign over his vaccination policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, the United States  experienced its worst measles outbreak in three decades this year, almost entirely driven by infections in people who are not vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University who specializes in public health, welcomed the standing order. Until the state issued it, she said, Massachusetts – despite its reputation for being at the vanguard in public health – was making it hard if not impossible for people to get the new booster approved by the FDA. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As she herself found out when she tried to get the booster the past few days, she said, primary care doctors have largely shunted responsibility for administering COVID shots to pharmacies, because physicians are swamped with patients seeking other care. But the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy forbids pharmacists from administering COVID shots without the authorization of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you can’t get it at a pharmacy and you can’t get it at a doctor’s office, you can’t get it,” said Parmet, who was eligible for the shot because she is over the age of 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Not only did the state say that pharmacists could now administer the booster shots without the CDC panel’s authorization, Parmet noted, the Healey administration broadened the group of people who could receive it. .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What they’re trying to do is increase accessibility beyond what the FDA envisioned or suggested,” she said. “This looks like it’s going to address the problem and reassert our leadership in public health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The governor’s standing order authorized pharmacists to administer two Moderna booster vaccines: mNEXSPIKE for people 12 and older and Spikevax for people 5 and older. It also authorized Pfizer’s Comirnaty for people five and older and Novavax’s Nuvaxoid for people 12 and older.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Children younger than 5 typically receive vaccines at their pediatrician’s offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a breaking story and will be updated. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

If anything, they just got worse. Then, the coughing started—which the mother-of-three thought was the so-called hundred day cough that ran rampage last winter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until she began experiencing breathlessness a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-20bb5730-8813-11f0-b761-7f9717a666fb"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; that she thought it could be something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken on December 20 revealed that she had a significant amount of fluid in her lungs, which doctors were concerned could be a warning sign of blood cancer —and what would be an incurable diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, her haematologist mentioned that around half of patients diagnosed with a different type of cancer, called thymoma—a rare type of cancer that starts in the thymus gland in between the lungs—also have an autoimmune disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve thought she was suffering from common digestive issues when she was unable to finish her meal whilst on holiday with her family in October half term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve (pictured left) with her children Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to the GP who gave her antacids to ease her symptoms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Even still, her doctors' primary concern was blood cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the heartbreaking ordeal, Ms Fanning told the Daily Mail: 'When they detected fluid in my lungs and said they'd need to start treatment immediately my heart sunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Two of my children have birthdays in January, so after my biopsy, I ran around trying to get the last bits together—balloons and presents—the call came two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On January 4 I was told I likely had blood cancer and that they had a bed for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was heartbreaking having to explain to my children that I wasn't going to be there for them. They watched from the window as I left, crying their eyes out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten days later, Ms Fanning was discharged from hospital whilst doctors waited on test results to confirm whether it was blood cancer or in fact thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I asked what my prognosis was, I was told I would just have to be patient and wait for the results. It was horrendous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Devastatingly, the tests confirmed stage four thymoma that had spread to the lining of her lungs, meaning it was incurable—an avoidable prognosis had it been caught earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only in December when she started experiencing breathlessness alongside a persistent cough that she thought it could be something more serious &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to A&amp;amp;E and was immediately referred for scans which revealed fluid in her lungs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Given her symptoms, doctors were concerned that she could have blood cancer which had spread to the lining of her lungs - an incurable prognosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve was admitted for scans and a biopsy that same day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now Ms Fanning is doing everything she can to see her three children—Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2— grow up, despite being told that palliative chemotherapy, which would give her two years at most, was the only option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other cancers, experts do not know exactly causes thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus is a gland in the chest, between the lungs, which produces and releases hormones and helps the body fight off infections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is thought that people diagnosed with thymoma are more likely to also have an autoimmune disease—which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus gland helps keeps the immune system functioning properly, which may explain the link between autoimmune disease and thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being diagnosed with oral lichen planus a year earlier—an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin which lines the inside of the mouth—after suffering from painful mouth ulcers, the link with thymoma was never mentioned until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning started chemotherapy just over a week later on February 14 2025, but after just one round she was told the dose was too high and her body was struggling to cope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point she weighed just over 6 stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending 10 days in hospital, Maeve was discharged without treatment as doctors waited on the results of further scans which would confirm her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After an agonising wait, Maeve was eventually diagnosed with stage four thymoma - a rare but aggressive type of cancer which forms in the thymus gland between the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heartbreakingly, Maeve was given a very bleak prognosis of two years at most and was told that palliative care was the only option &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve also suffers from a rare autoimmune disease which has been linked with thymoma &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her oncologists reduced the dose and despite responding well to the first three rounds, the treatment had stopped working by round five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now undergoing second line chemotherapy every three weeks to try and keep the cancer under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has paired her medical treatment with complimentary private treatment in the form of  hyperthermia—which works by heating body tissue to help damage and kill cancer cells—hyperbaric oxygen therapy, curcumin infusions and light therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments—which were recommended to her by her nutritionist who specialises in cancer care—will hopefully alter her diagnosis and help her beat cancer for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning added: 'These treatments are life changing, and in some cases have seen people's cancer regress from stage four to earlier stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me its too early to say but I want to do absolutely everything I can to ensure I am alive to see by beautiful children grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was diagnosed, my youngest was just 18 months old and at the time I wasn't sure if Christmas 2024 would be my last with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a horrendous situation, every mother's worst nightmare and this is why I need to do everything I can to ensure I am still with them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together with her friends and family Ms Fanning has set up a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jgux5c-help-maeve?"&gt;GoFundMe Page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover the costs of her treatment which sees her travel down to London twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have so far raised around £42,000 which she hopes will see her through until Christmas. Altogether her treatments cost around £11,000 a month—a cost she could never cover alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now due to start proton beam therapy at University College London Hospital later this month which uses high energy proton beams to treat very rare types of cancers close to vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:56:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNOTdVNzNkN3JybzduQThteWFzX2dZZklFLTNIalBjRGxJYlBVQjFCc3RHSTdRMUoxYm13cUFjNEJ3RU53X0hvc0QxNmltVXJxTUFUQ3ZJMlU4N2hNZ0x2c2xYTlJtNXFmaFh1ZFZWMUNITEVXc3ZoS2RNcnFXVFIxQmJER0RNbmY5YlROYlMzMjhqUnNTOUIxM09RQzFsUDRVMmNJTkdOb9IBrAFBVV95cUxQN0xlLVQ0Y2xyV1pjcUQtblNtS3Rnb24yTGlvLVJlVkY3WDdBcmtEc2FJWHFXZDZWMDhpb1NYX2tyTFN1WTY4YU1Mci1BR3BjdDMtbWQyUkpmSlJjVTRtWHQ4WmotLTZSaFJCbzN2b0ZvRjgzYzVwNkwtc2hSN0JZdjFfVEFaNzkta1VQRXZObGcweUJxMHVnUXZoaHhmUXZiaWVkUWFXaUJmSFlf</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，体内脂肪可能是心力衰竭的主要原因- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/internal-fat-may-leading-cause-115100564.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A new theory suggests signals from fat tissue, not just the heart, may drive a common type of heart failure. (CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, has puzzled doctors for years. Nearly four million Americans and more than 30 million people worldwide live with this condition, yet treatment options remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional heart failure, where the heart muscle weakens and struggles to pump, HFpEF looks normal on scans. The heart still pushes blood forward, but it cannot relax and fill properly between beats. That stiffness makes you feel short of breath, drained of energy, and sometimes swollen in the legs, belly, or lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was thought to be the primary culprit. But a new idea challenges that view. According to Milton Packer, MD, Distinguished Scholar in Cardiovascular Science at Baylor University Medical Center and Visiting Professor at Imperial College London, the real driver may not be the heart at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team suggests that signals coming from fat tissue could be behind much of the disease. Their theory, called the Adipokine Hypothesis, was published in &lt;em&gt;JACC&lt;/em&gt; and presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Central illustration: Lines of evidence supporting the Adipokine Hypothesis of HFpEF. (CREDIT: Packer M, JACC 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat as a Messenger, Not Just Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people picture fat as little more than stored calories. In reality, fat is a living organ that sends out chemical messages across the body. These messengers, called adipokines, are proteins and hormones that can influence your heart, blood vessels, metabolism, and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fat is healthy, adipokines protect organs, reduce inflammation, and help control fluid balance. But when fat becomes excessive and unhealthy, the signals change. Harmful adipokines are released in higher amounts while the protective ones decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in fat biology, Packer explains, transforms fat into an organ that drives stress, inflammation, and scarring inside the heart. “Up to now, there has been no unifying hypothesis to explain HFpEF. That has resulted in significant misunderstanding and a lack of direction in both diagnosis and therapy,” he said. “This bold new framework helps to identify the true cause of HFpEF in most people. That should make an enormous difference in guiding effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Fat Signals Disrupt the Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new framework outlines several ways that adipokines from unhealthy fat might set HFpEF in motion. One route is inflammation. When fat tissue becomes stressed, it attracts immune cells that release even more inflammatory chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules damage blood vessel linings and heart muscle cells. Another pathway is vascular stiffness. Arteries lose flexibility, making it harder for blood to move and raising pressure inside the heart. Over time, scarring—or fibrosis—sets in. That scar-like tissue prevents the heart from relaxing and filling properly. Add in metabolic stress from conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, and the cycle accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a heart that seems to pump normally but fails to deliver enough blood to meet the body’s needs during exertion. Climbing a flight of stairs may suddenly feel exhausting, not because the heart cannot squeeze, but because it cannot fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis: Secretion of Adipokines From Biologically Transformed Visceral Adipose Tissue Leads to HFpEF. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strong Evidence Builds the Case&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis pulls together findings from many different fields. Patients with HFpEF almost always show extra fat stored deep inside the body, often wrapping around organs like the heart. Laboratory experiments in animals and cells demonstrate that adipokines can directly impair relaxation of heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel studies confirm that harmful adipokines limit dilation, which forces blood pressure up. And clinical data reveal that HFpEF commonly strikes those with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure—pointing again to fat’s central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea powerful is that it unites these scattered observations under one roof. Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart. Adipose tissue can secrete a broad array of molecules and cellular constituents that can act in an endocrine or paracrine manner to exert favorable or deleterious effects on the heart. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer stresses that body mass index, or BMI, is a poor guide because it is influenced by muscle and bone. Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains. In healthy people, adipocytes primarily secrete Domain I adipokines, with minimal secretion of Domain II adipokines and with suppression of Domain III adipokines. In people with visceral adiposity or obesity, adipose tissue secretes primarily Domain III adipokines, with suppression of Domain I adipokines. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis is still a theory, not a proven fact. Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades. By tackling fat as an active organ, science may open new doors for prevention and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/beta-blockers-cardiac-jacks-of-all-trades"&gt;Millions of people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; take &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems, especially after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies suggest that for many patients, these drugs may no longer be helpful – and in some cases, they could even be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta blockers work to lower heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the oxygen demands of the heart. Traditionally, they've been prescribed after a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; (myocardial infarction) to give the heart time to heal and reduce the risk of a second attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heart-cancer-strikes-very-rarely-an-expert-reveals-why"&gt;Heart Cancer Strikes Very Rarely. An Expert Reveals Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the catch: since beta blockers were introduced more than four decades ago, modern medical care approaches (including &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761"&gt;stents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/how-statin-drugs-protect-the-heart"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt;) have dramatically improved recovery after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many hearts rebound better than they once did. For women whose hearts recover well, the new research suggests that beta blockers may do more harm than good – increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-takeaway-food-packaging-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta blockers have long been a foundational treatment after acute myocardial&lt;br&gt;
infarction; their use was initially supported by the results of early randomized trials," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in one of their published papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7200.1730"&gt;these trials&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in an era that predates what is now modern standard care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether beta blockers still make sense today, scientists in Spain and Italy studied 8,438 patients across 109 healthcare centers who had survived a heart attack and had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; (EF) above 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normal EF – a measure of how efficiently the heart pumps blood– is 55–70 percent; below 40 percent indicates significant dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of the patients were treated with beta blockers in addition to standard care, while the other half were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an average of 3.7 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference between these groups in rates of a second &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, hospitalization for heart failure, or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran the numbers on just the 1,627 women – a group who were older, had more comorbidities, and received fewer guideline-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women on beta blockers actually fared worse, with higher risks of complications and death. The risk was greatest in women whose hearts had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;recovered the best&lt;/a&gt; and in those taking the highest doses. This pattern did not appear in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172873" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart.jpg" alt="Beta-blocker chart" class="wp-image-172873 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart-528x415.jpg 528w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart-600x472.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172873" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta blockers showed no improvements in health outcomes in the study cohort.

Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="shifting_the_way_doctors_think"&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart.

Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="treatments_may_already_be_here"&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains.

Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades.

Simple carbs include food items like white bread, pastries, and sugary drinks. When eaten, these break down quickly into glucose, thus causing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. However, when we have complex carbs-- like whole grains, legumes, and vegetables-- they are digested slowly due to their high fiber content. And so, they slowly release glucose, thus providing steady energy, preventing sudden sugar spikes, and improving insulin sensitivity over time.

Perhaps a kind friend could have suggested to Bi that there were other explanations. Instead, Bi had a set of legal adversaries and a supportive echo chamber. On Facebook, GCs and IPs alike expressed sympathy for Bi’s tragic posts: Everyone knew bad surrogates existed, and based on Bi’s claims, it sounded like Smith was one. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a Bay Area fertility doctor and influencer, called Smith “a criminal” and “a psycho.” Bi’s $1,275-an-hour lawyer, Elizabeth Sperling, wondered whether digging through social media posts might show Smith engaging in “strenuous activity” that could explain the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bi’s husband focused on stabilizing the family, a move he credits with saving their marriage. He blamed the hospital, not Smith, but told me that the litigation is “her grieving process.” He tried to stay out of the legal stuff so that Bi couldn’t blame him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Smith had planned&lt;/span&gt; to go back to work shortly after giving birth. Instead, she couldn’t stop bleeding. Even though SAI had determined she hadn’t breached the contract, the escrow stopped paying, leaving Smith reliant on disability benefits as she faced an increasing pile of terrifying bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When Smith was finally cleared to return to work, a month after Leon died, Bi emailed Smith’s HR department to ask about her health plan. Bi also reported Smith to a federal agency, claiming that Smith was committing fraud. The stress on Smith was already high: Her supervisor at work had found her crying on and off for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Smith hadn’t heard from Bi since her terse reply to the condolence email. Then, Bi texted her a screenshot of a Facebook post about another GC who’d had an abruption at almost 32 weeks—but that GC had called 911 and the baby had lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Next, Bi iMessaged a photo of Leon’s corpse to Smith’s 7-year-old son’s iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;In the months&lt;/span&gt; after Leon died, Bi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Called the FBI 12 times. Reported Smith, SAI, the hospital, and Clarity escrow to more than a dozen state and federal regulators and numerous professional organizations. Launched a new round of her $30 million venture fund, backed by Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, President Trump’s “AI and crypto czar,” on Leon’s due date. Posted Leon’s ChatGPT-written endorsement from heaven, offering his “eternal blessings” for her work. Created TikToks, Instagram Reels, Facebook posts, X threads, LinkedIn Updates, and a website for her advocacy. Posted links disclosing Smith’s full name, photo, address, employer, mortgage license number, and son’s first name to her website. Asked her husband, again and again, how it was possible that Smith had carried her son but felt “nothing” about his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe hyVpEN callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby Leon’s empty crib.&lt;/p&gt;

She got on lithium for her bipolar disorder in early 2021 and began looking for surrogates as soon as she stopped feeling “sedated.” I spoke to the therapist Bi hired to consult with her and Valdeiglesias. She told me that, of the 792 intended parents she has evaluated for surrogacy or gamete donation in the last decade, she has declined to recommend only about a dozen. “I’m not gatekeeping,” she said. When it comes to serious mental illness, she added, it’s up to them to disclose. One of Bi’s fertility doctors, meanwhile, told me it’s not his place to scrutinize intended parents. He defers to the recommendation of the psychological interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If an intended parent gets turned down, they can usually find another therapist, another clinic, another agency. But without anyone questioning her plans, Bi seemed betrayed by the challenges of third-party reproduction. “Surrogacy is supposed to be the safest route,” she wrote on Instagram. It wasn’t just Leon’s death that pushed Bi into her spiral of legal action and social media posts. It was the apparent lack of control of having her child inside another woman’s body—the most basic fact of surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNU3FOeG1jSkVJTFBtXzR6U3FmeUp1UlRnVEpzM0VHeUlxbEpaVjVQQ1Y5VEN6eERXME1BQlppVS1XazRJd1o3dWFzUGEtNWxLbnZuaWlaTXp6YVJkb0F6b19xOXJ3c3pYVzB6MFlDZ2hBTnBNX0ZmdmpiUW5IZU9OU0YxdXRpc2M</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情波浪席卷加利福尼亚州。一些官员敦促居民戴上口罩--《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/as-covid-wave-washes-over-california-some-health-officials-urge-residents-to-mask-up</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A COVID wave is washing over California, with the state seeing continued increases in the number of newly confirmed cases and hospitalizations as some officials urged the public to take greater precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the recent increases has prompted some county-level health officials to recommend that residents once again consider wearing masks in indoor public settings, at least until transmission has declined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California currently has “high” coronavirus levels in sewage, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And increases are being seen across the Golden State, from Los Angeles County to the San Francisco Bay Area to areas around the state capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that coronavirus infections are either “growing” or “likely growing” in 30 states, including California. Twenty-one states have either “very high” or “high” viral levels in wastewater. Of all regions of the U.S., the West has the highest levels of coronavirus in wastewater, followed by the South. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“California is experiencing a summer COVID wave,” said Dr. Aimee Sisson, the health officer in Yolo County, just west of Sacramento. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus lab tests are coming back positive also continues to climb. For the week that ended Aug. 23, 12.07% of tests across the state came back positive, up from a rate of 6.03% for the week that ended July 26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar leaps in rates were seen in L.A. County, where the positive test rate was 13.44%, up from 8.11% four weeks earlier; in Orange County, it was 18.1%, up from 9.4%; and in San Francisco, it was 8.7%, up from 7.1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she received many calls related to outpatient cases of COVID-19 while on call over the Labor Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are definitely seeing an upswing in patients with COVID,” Hudson said. “Thankfully, inpatient cases are few and far between. Wastewater levels, however, are still rising in Los Angeles, so we have not reached the top of this current wave.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this summer hasn’t seen COVID activity to the extent of a year ago, when the state experienced its worst summer wave since 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will have to see what direction things go over the next one to two weeks to have a better idea” of where we end up, Hudson said. Students returning to school as well as from travel and socialization over the holiday weekend, could fuel further spread of the virus, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, the overall level of COVID hospital admissions remains “low,” but is increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week that ended Aug. 23, there were 3.62 hospital admissions for COVID for every 100,000 residents; up from a comparable rate of 1.9 four weeks earlier. The most recent rate is also higher than during the peak seen during the winter, which maxed out at 2.61 admissions for every 100,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for COVID-like illness are also up in Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Clara counties. In L.A. County, 2.8% of emergency room visits were for illnesses such as fever plus a cough or sore throat, up from 2.2% four weeks earlier. In Orange County, 2.6% of ER visits were for COVID-like illness, up from 1.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current percent of COVID-19 positivity is higher than at any point last winter,” according to Dr. Christopher Zimmerman of the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division and Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 23, 1.9% of total hospitalizations in Orange County were due to COVID — higher than at any point seen during the winter, but less than half of last summer’s peak of 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s unclear “how high or how severe this summer’s COVID wave may be,” Zimmerman and Chinsio-Kwong said, noting that this year’s rise began later than it did in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, COVID-19 hospitalizations are currently about as high as last winter’s peak, but remain lower than the peaks of the last two summers, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisson said that coronavirus levels are high in the wastewater of both Sacramento and West Sacramento, one of the most populous cities in Yolo County. Sisson &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.yolocounty.gov/Home/Components/News/News/14027/4918" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that everyone age 2 and up in West Sacramento “wear a mask when they are around others in indoor public spaces,” since coronavirus levels in sewage there are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other areas of Yolo County, including UC Davis and Woodland, where viral levels in wastewater are considered “medium,” Sisson said she recommends that people wear masks around others indoors “if they are 65 or older, have a weakened immune system, have an underlying medical condition that puts them at a greater risk of severe COVID-19, or spend time around people who fall into these categories.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wearing a high-quality mask such as an N95, KN95, or KF94 that fits well continues to provide strong protection,” Sisson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus cases are increasing in Sacramento County, and coronavirus wastewater levels are considered high, according to Casey Camacho, a spokesperson for the Sacramento County Department of Health Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Department of Public Health also is encouraging people “to consider wearing a well-fitted mask in crowded indoor spaces, including when traveling, and to stay at home if they feel sick.” Coronavirus levels in San Francisco wastewater, and COVID hospitalizations, are up this summer “but remain below last summer’s peaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Santa Clara County, Northern California’s most populous county, COVID-related hospitalizations are up, and coronavirus levels are “high” in the sewershed of San José and Palo Alto. Current viral levels in wastewater are now similar to the levels seen in the summer of 2023, but haven’t reached last summer’s peak. COVID hospitalization rates also remain lower than recent summer seasons, public health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025-26 version of the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be available within a few days at some of the nation’s pharmacy retailers, such as Walgreens and CVS. But some people are expressing frustration at new rules issued by the Trump administration that in effect require younger, healthy people under age 65 who don’t say they have an underlying health condition to consult with a healthcare provider to get a COVID vaccination in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to prevent severe disease and death from COVID-19,” Sisson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement came under criticism by Dr. Jerome Adams, a former surgeon general who served under the first Trump administration. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/JeromeAdamsMD/status/1962906970089787442" target="_blank"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on social media, Adams said requiring people to consult with a healthcare provider before getting a COVID vaccine puts up “real access barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have insurance and can get in to see a doctor (which is no small feat in the U.S.), many doctors are going to be reticent to prescribe a medication ‘off label,’ given the (in many cases unfounded) recent rhetoric from HHS leaders,” Adams wrote, referring to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is led by the vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has a history of disparaging vaccines, has said he wants more studies on the COVID-19 shots. Other health experts have said seeking additional testing for COVID vaccines is unnecessary, given the extensive testing done before they were first distributed, and their track record since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line? It is both statistically (according to HHS’s own data) and pragmatically untrue that ‘100% of those who choose a Covid vaccine can get one.’ Continuing to repeat this reflects a lack of knowledge, empathy, or honesty,” Adams wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxPWkdZQWpiRkNjV0dyWmRJYjhLRTFfY20zMkFWRERvaThiX1hmdEtuMkQtVGRuTk9waDgwVDF0MU9xWFZFODFTY254Ml9kM0szZFlxdFFBTUJqMjJpam9RSkFFbHhnWWVfcmdqdm1CTFhFVDlaTlV3OTZ2Ri15bGFqeUthV0t5b3FrbEJ3YjFwVUJURXRpcGlHSnYtdW1FSnFmZ0pqMG96LV9HSDJ0M09MM1FrTVJDY2hIRVNjdkFLaEU4ck9rWFlmM1JnYV9hNkpGZUE</guid></item><item><title>根据物理治疗师的说法，每个人在70岁后都应该做的6项基本运动，以增强力量和行动能力-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/here-are-the-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-after-turning-70-according-to-a-physical-therapist</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f"&gt;If you’re looking for exercises to improve your strength, balance, mobility, and function as you get older, you’ve come to the right place. As we age, strengthening the muscles in our body is more important than ever — strength training is one of the most effective ways to prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass. It can also help build stronger bones and improve your balance and stability, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a complete beginner or are returning to exercise following a long break, the good news is that things don’t have to be overly complicated. In fact, just using your bodyweight and performing a few simple exercises a few times a week can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f-2"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr Nancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist who specializes in exercises for older adults, and in a video posted to her social media accounts, she shares the six exercises she prescribes to patients between 70 and 90 years old.

Here’s how to do them with good form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-lateral-step-over" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-lateral-step-over"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Lateral step over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="443f71f4-d1bc-44e4-9d5f-d9d5a3bc0ccf"&gt;For this exercise, use a can of food from the cupboard and place it on the floor. Step to one side of the can, and stand tall, engaging your core with your hands on your hips. Lift one leg and step over the can laterally, then follow with your other foot. Then, repeat the move, stepping back to the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-box-squats" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-box-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Box squats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="83cd6595-3a1b-4b5f-a9d9-02508c9de23a"&gt;For this exercise, place a box on top of a chair. Ensure the chair is sturdy and doesn’t have wheels. Squat down, bending at your knees and keeping your core engaged until your glutes touch the box, then push down through your feet to return to a standing position, squeezing your glutes at the top. As you get stronger, make the box lower to the chair, then remove it entirely. To make the exercise easier, extend your arms away from the body. To make it harder, place your hands on your hips. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-standing-hip-extension" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-standing-hip-extension"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Standing hip extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c413bab-30f5-4b5a-ab7e-1294638f3ea9"&gt;For this exercise, stand facing a wall and place both hands on the wall for support. Shift your bodyweight into one leg, and straighten the other leg, keeping your foot flexed, before taking the leg back and lifting it a few inches off the floor. Keep kicking back for 10 reps, then switch onto the other leg. Aim for three sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-single-leg-slides" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-single-leg-slides"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Single leg slides &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="988f05a3-3742-41c1-965c-853097326459"&gt;For this exercise, you’ll need to grab a tea towel. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, and engage your core. Place one foot on a tea towel, and keeping a slight bend in both knees, slide the leg out to the side, then bring it back in, then slide it back behind you, moving slowly and with control. Keep the rest of your body still — it should only be the one leg that is moving. Complete 10 reps, then switch to work on the other leg. Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-standing-hip-flexion" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-hip-flexion"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Standing hip flexion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="c39987cf-4116-4193-94b0-a2a32356fac6"&gt;Standing facing a wall, place both hands on the wall for support. From here, engage your core and lift one leg off the ground, keeping a 90-degree bend in your knee to march your leg up towards your torso. Place the leg back on the floor, and repeat on the other side. Keep alternating sides. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-6-lateral-toe-taps" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-lateral-toe-taps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Lateral toe taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f83bd91-41e0-4166-8164-df7a56faf5d2"&gt;For this exercise, start with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. Place your hands on your hips. From here, lift one leg off the floor, point your toe, and tap the leg out to the side of your body. Return to your starting position, and repeat on the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9e3ca6d5-f2f2-4f35-9bfd-900f60099211"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e47481eb-b462-4ccb-b677-9d3f09f76f41"&gt;To make this workout easier, drop the number of sets — start by completing one, and work your way up. To make it harder, increase the difficulty of the exercises by increasing your range of motion — remove the box on the chair during the squats, or the size of the step in the lateral step overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exercise will work the muscles in your lower body as well as your core, and test your balance and stability. A lot of the exercises will work one side of the body at a time, and you might notice the exercises are easier on one side. This is normal, and working on your weaker side can help correct any imbalances in the body, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

You’re feeling sick, we get sick, too. Just maneuver through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His father taught him that a husband provides, a wife takes care of children. Emotional equity wasn’t built in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brokenforbetter/?hl=en" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; had survived infidelity and rebuilt their lives as marriage coaches. They lived through the death of their teenage son in a car accident and became grief leaders. But when Schaer watched his wife Denette suffer from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/07/12/what-is-perimenopause-first-signs-typical-age-and-what-to-know/70311139007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that grew to sharp mood swings, forgetfulness and extreme fatigue – he couldn't bear losing the woman he’d known for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I needed to find compassion and empathy,” Schaer, 49, says. “Nothing in life I would have my wife walk through by herself. I had to figure how to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together." data-c-credit="Octavio Jones, For USA TODAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He set the thermostat in their Tampa home to 69 degrees&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; built what he calls a wind tunnel of fans above his wife’s side of the bed and bought a white noise machine to block out the irritating way his breathing sounded. He did laundry and other chores; many he admits that he should have been doing all along. He learned about hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“But most important,” he says, “I listened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Just as Gen X and millennial women are changing the way they approach perimenopause and menopause, piercing through the cultural zeitgeist, so are their husbands and partners. &lt;a href="https://mindpumppodcast.com/2582-the-strange-signs-symptoms-of-perimenopause-with-dr-mary-claire-haver/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bro fitness podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are now talking about hormones and strength training. Men are joining their wives for medical appointments, going to &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;menopause retreats&lt;/a&gt;, and making TikTok videos and &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. They are doing so with both a sense of urgency and sometimes humor. One man even named his wife’s menopause symptoms “Agnes” to remind them that it is part of his wife, but not all of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the process by which men are approaching menopause in this generation is akin to other ways they are defining masculinity. Or, at the very least, exploring how they have understood what it means to be a man. Maybe masculinity still does mean taking care of and protecting your partner, being the breadwinner and remaining stoic all the same. But just like the men who understood changing a diaper in the 1990s didn't take away their manliness, so can participating in their spouse's emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This evolution in masculinity, where vulnerability and authenticity are valued, moves away from the restrictive path in which the men interviewed by USA TODAY were raised. It’s not just changing them, but their marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Women are welcoming men to the menoconversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause shouldn’t simply be discussions in a gynecologist’s office, says &lt;a href="https://www.tamsenfadal.com/about" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tamsen Fadal&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Menopause-Charge-Health-Reclaim/dp/0306833549" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“How to Menopause.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet it was almost always relegated to the exam room, somewhere with stirrups in sight&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It's not only about the body temperature changes. There's the so-called "menobelly." The irritability or walking into a room only to forget why seconds later. Oh, and a plummeting sex drive, which almost always makes women spiral into shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This can create conflict in the relationship if you don’t bring men into it,” Fadal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=653&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1306&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.' data-c-credit="Craig Barritt, Getty Images For ADAPT Community"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are few studies on how men view menopause, but one of the most recent shows that almost three of four men now say they talk with their partner about menopause. These men also discuss treatment options, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2019/10000/the_mate_survey__men_s_perceptions_and_attitudes.6.aspx" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menopause, the Journal of the Menopause Society.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause, the time leading up to the menopause where a woman's period stops, can last up to 10 years and include a fluctuation in hormones. It can present with symptoms ranging from frozen shoulder to achy joints and often women suffer for years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These are men who grew up with fathers who ignored menopause. These are men who now are realizing their mothers went through this and they didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After all, there's a silence that had always accompanied women going through menopause. If they dared asked for help, it was about masking symptoms − and feelings − in order to please others. It was to not draw any more attention to the fact that they were aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These also are men who see that while divorce rates overall are dropping,&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/14/divorce-women-perimenopause-menopause/85622804007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; divorces among adults 50&lt;/a&gt; and older are increasing. Seven in 10 women blame perimenopause or menopause for the breakdown of their marriage, according to a survey in the United Kingdom by the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/family-law-menopause-project-newson-health-research-partner-shahzady/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Family Law Menopause Project and Newsom Health Research and Education.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Fadal helped make &lt;a href="https://themfactorfilm.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“The M Factor,”&lt;/a&gt; a documentary about menopause. When it was screened earlier this year, the majority of audiences were women. Then she noticed a shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Women were starting to bring their husbands or partners to help them understand this,” she says. “Half of the population will go through menopause, and we need the other half to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Finding his vulnerability in talking about menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theparentexpress" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Jesse Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was driving home from his sales job when he heard menopause expert &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/17/mary-claire-haver-menopause-the-m-factor/75702888007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Mary Claire Haver&lt;/a&gt; on a health podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He was astounded by how often &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/23/hormone-therapy-estrogen-perimenopause-antidepressants/85282744007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;women are misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, the misunderstandings about hormone therapy, and his own ignorance. So, he posed a question on his parenting TikTok account this summer: “Do women want husbands to talk to them about menopause?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hundreds of women told him they wanted men to learn more. The husband and father of two shifted his videos to menopause and perimenopause.

But, he says, he didn’t put that same energy into understanding his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until now. He started therapy. He’s reading books and watching videos to learn more about perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Now if I want to talk to my wife about how I’m feeling, I write in my journal.

It's about decreasing risks for &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559623/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;building strength&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of an assisted living facility. It's about the quality of the last third of a woman's life. As Maher learned more, his business shifted to helping women better understand and get treatment – from hormone therapy to nutrition – in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Men need to understand it’s not just mood swings,” says Maher, 41. “It’s the collapse of estrogen and progesterone and testosterone. Women need this to be healthy – for their hearts, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11387275/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their brains&lt;/a&gt;.

While trawling survey data on household spending to try to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes were rising&lt;/a&gt; so rapidly in his home country, he was surprised to note that people were buying smaller quantities of sugar, salt and other ingredients generally associated with these conditions than they had in previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when Monteiro and his colleagues dug deeper did they find the culprit. People were buying less sugar to prepare cakes and desserts, but eating more of it in pre-made pastries and breakfast cereal. They were buying less salt, but consuming more of it in frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets and dehydrated packet soups. “We realized the problem was our traditional dietary patterns were being replaced by foods that are processed so many times that they can no longer be recognized in the final products. We called them ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02750-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51412836.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Ultra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteiro, a nutrition and public-health researcher at the University of São Paulo, first used &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the term ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; (UPF) in a paper in 2009, arguing that people interested in promoting healthy diets should focus more on the degree, extent and purpose of processing than on nutrient profiles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was a radical idea that caught the attention of other researchers, who, over the next decade or so, published dozens of papers linking UPFs with obesity and a range of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments took notice, too. In 2014, Brazil began advising people to avoid UPFs. Other countries, including France, Belgium and Israel, followed suit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been a critic of UPFs, saying in January that they are “poisoning the American people”. In May, the US government announced plans for a research agenda to support nutrition policy and improve people’s diets, in part by improving understanding of the impacts of UPFs on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s good evidence that diets high in UPFs are associated with poor health, some scientists are sceptical that the UPF category is useful for research or as the basis for dietary advice, arguing that it is too broad and ill-defined. It makes little sense, they say, to lump together foods as diverse as shop-bought yogurts and wholegrain breads with doughnuts and potato crisps. And they wonder whether UPFs are largely linked to poor health just because they tend to be high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre and vitamins. Questions remain, but recent research findings can provide some guidance for people trying to make healthy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing diets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;humans have been processing food&lt;/a&gt; by cooking it. The fermentation, milling, salting, pickling and smoking of food also have long histories. Canning, pasteurization and the use of additives, such as artificial sweeteners and colouring agents, date back to the nineteenth century. Today, many foods undergo multiple forms of advanced processing, such as fractionation into constituent sugars, oils and fibres; hydrogenation to alter physical properties; and extrusion, which subjects ingredients to high temperature, pressure, shear forces and rapid expansion. These foods are generally classified as UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPF consumption has grown since the 1950s, initially in high-income countries and, since the 1990s, in low- and middle-income countries&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Surveys suggest that UPFs make up almost 60% of calorie intake in the United States and United Kingdom, 48% in Canada and 42% in Australia (see ‘Ultra-processed intake’). Traditional eating patterns have proved more enduring in Romania (15% of calorie intake), Italy (18%), Brazil (22%) and France (31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ULTRA-PROCESSED INTAKE.

Dozens of studies have linked diets high in UPFs with increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cancer, asthma, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published last year, for example, epidemiologist Mingyang Song and his colleagues at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data on the diets and health of more than 110,000 US adults, who were tracked over a median period of more than 30 years. Song found that those with the highest proportion of calories from UPFs were 4% more likely to die of any cause during the study than were those with the lowest intake. Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, but not from cardiovascular or respiratory disease or from cancer&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Diets that included more processed meat, poultry, seafood and sugary drinks were associated with higher risks after researchers controlled for factors such as body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption and family health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that nutritional quality could be a big factor in why diets high in UPFs might be unhealthy. The increase in risk was much lower for those with diets that, although high in UPFs, were still defined as healthy according to a diet-scoring system called the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. Those diets included a lot of vegetables and nuts, and limited the intake of sugary drinks, red and processed meats, salt and trans fats. “The association between UPF consumption and mortality was much weaker once we accounted for dietary quality,” says Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, other research indicates that nutritional composition is not the whole story. When Samuel Dicken, a clinical scientist at University College London, reviewed 37 studies that reported health outcomes linked with UPFs, he found that almost all of the associations remained after researchers controlled for nutritional composition&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken and his colleagues subsequently ran a trial in which adults who were overweight or obese were asked to follow one of two diets defined as healthy according to the UK Eatwell Guide (see &lt;a href="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go.nature.com/4fpdeen&lt;/a&gt;), and then switched to the other diet. One of the diets was made up mostly of UPFs and the other mostly of minimally processed foods, but the two diets were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;matched for levels of protein&lt;/a&gt;, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium and sugar. Participants lost twice as much weight (an average of 2 kilograms versus 1 kg) on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF diet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings, published in August, suggest that the increased prevalence of health problems linked to a UPF diet in other studies cannot be fully explained by poor nutritional composition. So what other mechanisms might be involved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond processing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken’s study is one of only a handful of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on UPFs. Unlike retrospective and observational studies, RCTs can demonstrate causal links and so might offer a clearer picture, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first RCT on UPFs was carried out by a team led by integrative physiologist Kevin Hall, who until April was at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the HHS. For more than a decade, Hall has sought to overcome some of the limitations of nutrition research by confining study participants to a research hospital, so that their diets can be precisely recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he was approached by two Brazilian researchers at a meeting after he presented the results of one such study, comparing a low-carbohydrate, animal-product-based diet with a low-fat vegan diet. “They told me they had enjoyed my talk, but that my focus on nutrients was very twentieth century and that really, I should be thinking about the extent and purpose of processing food,” says Hall, who had not then heard of UPFs. He was sceptical but intrigued enough that he devised a trial in which 20 adults stayed at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and consumed a diet high in either UPFs or unprocessed food for two weeks before swapping diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Employees in protective clothing and hard hats check hundreds of breaded chicken nugget pieces on a factory production line conveyor belt." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Breaded chicken nuggets are inspected before being packaged at a factory near Orléans in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other researchers, Hall defined UPFs using a system developed by Monteiro. Known as NOVA, it classifies food into four groups according to the extent, type and purpose of processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as vegetables and pasta, are at one end of the scale. At the other end are UPFs, which undergo multiple industrial processes and usually contain substances rarely used in home kitchens, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and additives, including colouring and emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in Hall’s RCT could eat as much as they liked, but the food presented to them was matched for nutrient groups. To Hall’s surprise, the results, published in 2019, showed that participants consumed around 500 calories more per day on average while on the UPF diet — and gained an average of 0.9 kg over the two weeks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They lost that same amount of weight while on the unprocessed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hall dug further into the results to try to understand why people on some diets, including those high in UPFs, eat more calories, he and his colleagues found that people consumed more if they ate quicker&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants also consumed more calories when the foods were energy dense (containing more calories per gram) and “hyper-palatable” — containing ingredients high in combinations of fat, carbohydrates, sugar and salt, which, some researchers say, activate reward signals and circumvent satiety mechanisms in the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Energy-dense foods provide more calories in less time than those with fewer calories per gram because they are easier to eat, and many UPFs are energy dense because their water content has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00549-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_50690036.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How a junk-food splurge can change your brain activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions remained about what might be driving the extra intake, so Hall set up another trial, this time involving 36 people who spent a week each eating a minimally processed diet and three UPF diets: one was energy dense and hyper-palatable; another was energy dense but not hyper-palatable; and the last was neither energy dense nor hyper-palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is ongoing, but early findings show that participants ate more and gained more weight while on the energy-dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet compared with the minimally processed diet. Most of the increases in consumption and body weight that occurred on the energy dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet also occurred on the energy dense diet low in hyper-palatable foods, suggesting that energy density could be the more important factor to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that eating more slowly and eating diets with low energy density are associated with lower calorie consumption — and that various factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;food texture&lt;/a&gt;, can affect eating speed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, Ciarán Forde, a nutrition researcher at Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, asked 50 adults to eat as much as they liked during four lunches. He found that they ate much less when presented with hard-textured foods, such as potato waffle fries, than when given soft-textured foods such as mashed potato, regardless of whether the foods were UPFs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “What we saw was that the speed of eating and the texture properties of meals drive consumption, not the degree of processing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forde’s team went on to ask 41 adults to follow, for 14 days, either a UPF diet consisting of foods with harder textures associated with slow eating, or a UPF diet made up of softer foods linked to faster eating, and then swap over. The meals presented were matched for energy density, and, Forde says, the energy density of foods that participants actually consumed turned out to be the same as well. Although the full results are yet to be published, participants consumed 369 fewer calories per day, on average, when their diet consisted of slowly consumed foods than when it contained those linked to faster consumption, according to initial results Forde presented at a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a combination of energy density and food texture explains why people eat more, says Forde, who has received funding from multinational food companies. “Maybe it’s not something magic in ultra-processed foods that we don’t understand. Rather it’s just about factors we’ve long known, about how foods are eaten and how they drive meal size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Malla explains that while antipsychotic medications are effective, they only go some way to addressing symptoms of disease. "Antipsychotic medication really only works for positive symptoms, which are things that should not be there, like illusions or hallucinations," says Malla. Negative symptoms are the absence of things that should be there, such as emotional expression, ability to generate thoughts and ability to relate socially to people. The reverse of which would be social withdrawal, a lack of experience, feelings and so on. "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/epa-guidance-on-assessment-of-negative-symptoms-in-schizophrenia/86280E47EC2DA56EC5F9D8B951DF698E" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Medications have very little, if any, impact on these&lt;/a&gt;," says Malla. Generally, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/psychological-and-psychosocial-interventions-for-negative-symptoms-in-psychosis-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/73B8450EAB1E3046B4ABE0C3C4C5A1D2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;negative symptoms, like low mood, respond poorly to drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Americans overestimate how often people with mental illnesses are perpetrators of violent crimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla suggests that the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32981550/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;social differences between India and Canada&lt;/a&gt; go some way to explain the difference in the success of treatments. Homelessness is less common among people with schizophrenia in Chennai, for example. Malla puts this down to families wanting to keep mental illness within the household so that any stigma associated with having a family member with schizophrenia can be "kept under wraps". He says that marriage is a key concern for families, and anything that might affect an offspring's marriageability will be dealt with as a family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla points out that families in Canada are as interested in taking care of their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, as they are in India. But he says that the sophisticated legalisation of contact and confidentiality with patients can be a problem. A young adult in North America can more easily leave home and cut off contact if they wish, he says. But this could lead to worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/inm.13198" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Family interventions have been shown to be effective&lt;/a&gt; in improving recovery from psychosis. "In Chennai, a patient hardly ever comes to the clinic without a family member. We hypothesised that it would result in a better outcome on negative symptoms," says Malla. "And that's exactly what we found." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:07:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRDlSR3BvOWpEZVpJZkZMLVlpV3ppdl80cmRKMDRoMl8wRmdVVVBQeDlqRlBtM19VUW5TdVdHSHh5MTItd1FkbGluT3pPVzItNEhqVlM4ek03T0Fwa1ZoTlJ1OFlHd21FNGVXX1hqR0luNmxrbjVvTE1yMnBvaEVwdE1aMDVNUFNjcVZKTllHcEROR1JNZWRpODVwbE5LQTRZ</guid></item><item><title>减肥后皮肤松弛：专家希望你知道的事情-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/well/loose-skin-after-weight-loss.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xRnJodDZGOEdxTk1aOGpjUWlRTGF4cHJFUm14N1hSVVN2b3FFX0UzdmVXN0xnQlUteEJFYWtPbmRjcHdrT0l6TVM4bmlQNFpOV3pBbl9INWtYbGc0ak9Rd2g1Nm4wSU5QSm5SRm5qV0Jsdk9MM01HbWgtR3VpZw</guid></item><item><title>漫长的新冠肺炎疫情对医生和护士的严重打击- Medscape</title><link>https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/long-covid-hitting-doctors-and-nurses-hard-2025a1000n7q</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Siegelman, MD, contracted COVID-19 in August 2020 and, 3 months later, published a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773056" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; about his experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, he’s still dealing with the symptoms, as one of many healthcare providers who have long COVID. He said his experience highlights the impact of long COVID on hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers, by some estimates, who have been on the frontlines fighting the pandemic from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I reflect on that paper from &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, and I thought that 3 months was a long time,” said Siegelman, associate professor of emergency medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine and a practicing emergency room doctor in Atlanta. “And here I am, 5 years later, and I still have symptoms. I think that’s the case for a lot of patients with long COVID, that it just keeps getting longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating the precise number of US healthcare workers like Siegelman affected by long COVID is challenging. But several new studies suggest the toll of long COVID has affected healthcare workers in the US more than other Americans who have experienced or are currently living with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1582872/full" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, which surveyed 1678 US healthcare workers, found that 7.7% reported experiencing long COVID. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10167639/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/em&gt; in March 2023, involving 445 healthcare workers, reported a prevalence of 9.44%. Outside the US, a systematic review of long COVID’s impact on the National Health System out of the UK found that 18% of healthcare workers were out of work due to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Putrino, PhD, physical therapist and director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai Health System, New York City, who has been helping those with long COVID recover, has seen a fair number of healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say 5%-7% of the people who are coming into our center right now are healthcare workers,” he said. His clinic has treated around 3500 people with long COVID and sees 500-700 new patients per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Healthcare workers are probably where we do start to see disproportionate effects of long COVID,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Acute to Chronic COVID Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegelman said his long COVID symptoms are far different from what he initially experienced, making it difficult for him to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, I had fever, headaches, some chills, but it wasn’t bad,” he said. “I was able to stay at home, and I had no respiratory issues at that point. Over these years, I’ve had little setbacks, sometimes big setbacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His low-grade fevers refused to abate, and he quarantined himself in his basement for 40 days to isolate himself from his family, speaking with them through FaceTime or walkie-talkies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegelman was out of work for about 6 months before returning, and only in a limited capacity, which he said made him feel as though a burden was placed on his colleagues. He could initially only work just 4 hours at a time during day shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Siegelman 2 years before he was able to return to regular, full-time work — but with some restrictions due to the chronic nature of his condition. He can’t work night shifts and still lives with fatigue, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/241381-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, and palpitations that require consistent therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m still on a pile of medicine, [though] it’s fewer than I used to be on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said several emergency medicine physicians he knows have been living with worse cases of long COVID. One couldn’t return to work in a clinical capacity at all, forced to relinquish a career she loved and transition into an administrative role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, Siegelman published a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11293604/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Topics in Antiviral Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which detailed the stories of two physicians who became patients. One couldn’t work for 5 months and then could only work limited, part-time shifts for several years. The other physician experienced brain fog and other cognitive issues that made it difficult to carry out crucial clinical tasks like delivering patient reports and presentations to supervisors. He also said he had to “do more, read more, and work harder to retain the same information as previously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 Million Americans Live With Long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300947" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;recent Yale-led study&lt;/a&gt; found that 20 million Americans have been diagnosed with long COVID, suggesting potentially hundreds of thousands of US healthcare workers have been affected. Months after their initial infection, these people struggle to return to work, let alone be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/long-covid-among-workers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;January 2025 report&lt;/a&gt; from the US Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, nearly 1 in 4 healthcare workers (23.5%) with long COVID reported their symptoms significantly affected their work. Arjun Venkatesh, MD, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, and a lead author of the Yale-led study, has observed the mental and physical toll long COVID has had on his fellow colleagues suffering from the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five most prevalent symptoms among people who missed more than 10 workdays were fatigue, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1048596-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;headache&lt;/a&gt;, muscle aches, joint pains, and shortness of breath. Those with these specific symptoms were also the most likely to experience work loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venkatesh has mostly observed colleagues contracting COVID at home rather than at work. For those who later develop long COVID, treatment access remains an issue. Being a healthcare professional doesn’t necessarily guarantee better access to care or treatment than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard colleagues say something to the effect of ‘I’ve tried everything I could find…despite that, nothing has worked,’” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Stress Exacerbates the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putrino said the high-stress nature of many healthcare jobs makes workers in the medical industry especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a physician working in a critical care setting…you may have to work 4 or 5 hours beyond your shift,” he said. “That creates a really dangerous situation for people in the healthcare setting who live with long COVID because it means they could easily experience a crash as a result of pushing far beyond their energy envelope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare workers may not seek treatment before their illness spirals out of control, for a number of reasons, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that there is a stigma associated with healthcare workers admitting that they have an unmanaged chronic condition,” Putrino said. “So many healthcare workers that I’ve spoken to have said that due to minimizing comments from their colleagues or just a general fear of not being believed, they haven’t accessed care until their symptoms got really out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aileen Grant, PhD, a research fellow at the University of Stirling in Stirling, Scotland, has published a systematic &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299743" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the impact long COVID has on healthcare workers working within the National Health System in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant’s study found that 18% of participants were out of work due to their symptoms, but a large percentage of people continued to work despite their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our occupational health policies really aren’t fit for an episodic disability,” Grant said. “It’s almost a dichotomy between being in work or being out of work, whereas these people’s symptoms can fluctuate over time, and they can have crashes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misunderstanding Long COVID’s Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After National Health Service (NHS) workers on the frontlines combated the initial waves of the pandemic, they felt virtually ignored by the system they put their lives on the line for after being stricken themselves, Grant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were working a frontline occupation to help the NHS in its time of need, and then they were being abandoned once they took ill,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ireland, &lt;a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41570173.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;four nurses with long COVID profiled in The Irish Examiner&lt;/a&gt; said their lives have never been the same since their initial infection, with none being able to return to work. They feel their voices are being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Service Executive — Ireland’s publicly funded healthcare system — continues to fight its requests for sick leave. All four nurses belong to a group of around 160 Health Service Executive staff who rely on a special pay scheme to support them through long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy for policies that support long COVID research, treatment, and patient care is also lacking, healthcare workers say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venkatesh fears the Trump administration’s pullback in funding for COVID research may further hinder efforts to understand how to treat long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [Biden] administration had an entire office centered around long COVID…with a registry funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” he said. “I don’t know what the future holds with this new administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 08:56:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxON0lmYWQzQ3d1U0FtcVNfYjByUndnenZMYy1SZFpOZEhkdEZHLWphWGFYTG43YXBZTVBkZUUyZTJwQ3RSS25GOFI2cjZIeEItNnY3ZkdvU1ZhV045a1hya1ppNGRYTUZjMk9IWlQxbGJWSFFnT2VGX0NjT1JPRFQ2S0taZGJtSmhGYUs3VjZ3RVUtMXg1QWtr</guid></item><item><title>儿童疫苗接种计划的重大调整可能即将到来- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/03/childhood-vaccine-schedule-at-risk-rfk-cdc-turmoil/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts are bracing for what could be fundamental changes to childhood vaccine policies that don’t align with scientific consensus, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undergoes a major leadership shakeup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ousted CDC director Susan Monarez after she &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;refused his demand&lt;/a&gt; to approve all recommendations made by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee, whose members were handpicked by him. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has since &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/jim-oneill-cdc-acting-director/"&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; one of his allies, former biotech investor Jim O’Neill, as acting director.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four other senior CDC leaders &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;also resigned&lt;/a&gt;, including the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid the instability, experts fear that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is slated to meet on Sept. 18 and 19, could propose severe changes that limit commonly used vaccines. The committee &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-16706.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plans to discuss&lt;/a&gt; not only Covid-19 vaccines, but also other shots to protect against infectious diseases, including hepatitis B, respiratory syncytial virus, as well as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;ACIP’s last meeting&lt;/a&gt;, the first gathering of the new members chosen by Kennedy, some expressed skepticism towards vaccines, but the group did not make any recommendations that created major disruptions to the current schedule for children. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Now though, with Monarez gone, experts are concerned that members could “be very much emboldened to make more aggressive changes,” said Jose Romero, a former chair of the committee who has consulted for pharma companies on vaccine policy since leaving the committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet clear how long O’Neill will be acting director and how he will handle ACIP recommendations. He has described himself as “very strongly pro-vaccine,” but he’s also closely aligned with Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others in the administration have argued that ACIP historically rubber-stamped vaccine decisions — although the committee did debate evidence and withhold recommendations in some cases — and that vaccine makers should face greater scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The panel’s recommendations have real-world consequences. Federal and private payers are required to make vaccines free for people if they are recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. The committee also recommends which vaccines it thinks should be part of the Vaccines For Children Program, which covers the costs of vaccines and therapies for children without health insurance or on Medicaid. A little over half the nation’s children receive vaccines through the VFC program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, experts fear that the panel may restrict or roll back a recommendation that it made last meeting in support of a preventive monoclonal antibody to protect babies against RSV. Separately, they believe, members are likely to question hepatitis B shots that are given to infants at birth and that have been credited with preventing children from developing debilitating, lifelong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot of surprise likely to loom in terms of where this committee will go in this coming meeting and going forward,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. “It will be to continue to emphasize the alleged potential harms of vaccines, to understate their value and their effectiveness, and to continue to chip away at the infrastructure for our vaccine recommendations that we’ve had for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-covid-19"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration last week revoked emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/27/fda-covid-vaccines-kennedy-rescinds-emergency-use-authorization/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; narrower approvals that could make them more difficult to access, particularly for young children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Pfizer’s vaccine, developed with BioNTech, had been available to children over 6 months old under an emergency use authorization, but the latest move now restricts the shot to children older than 5. Moderna’s vaccine is available for children as young as 6 months, but only for those with an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness from a Covid infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others in the administration have argued that anyone can still get Covid vaccines if they want it but that the risks of these vaccines often outweigh any demonstrable benefit five years after the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Experts expect that ACIP will support the FDA authorizations, which the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The pediatric group  &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/pediatrician-group-rebuffs-rfk-issues-own-vaccine-recommendations/"&gt;issued its own recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 shots should be available for all children between 6 months and 23 months, as well as children over 2 at risk for severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rsv"&gt;RSV&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting, members &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-merck-rsv-monoclonal-antibody-enflonsia/"&gt;voted to recommend&lt;/a&gt; a new monoclonal antibody to protect infants from RSV, Merck’s Enflonsia. A similar product, Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s Beyfortus, has been in use since the fall of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But during the meeting, member Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, raised concern that there appeared to be more deaths in arms of clinical trials where children got the antibodies than in placebo arms. CDC and FDA staff noted that all deaths in trials are rigorously studied and researchers concluded that the deaths in these trials were not linked to the antibody. Levi nonetheless voted against recommending Enflonsia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the meeting has concluded, another ACIP member, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://www.malone.news/p/what-the-acip-wasnt-shown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on his blog&lt;/a&gt; a piece by Yaffa Shir-Raz, a researcher at the University of Haifa. She argued that the presentation of data on the antibody was flawed and obscured safety risks. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University, wrote a &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2025/08/23/a-baseless-attack-on-groundbreaking-rsv-therapies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; countering the post and explaining why the CDC’s analysis was epidemiologically sound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malone, though, said his trust in the CDC’s data presentation “appears to have been ill-advised.” He wrote that committee members had little chance to review the data ahead of the meeting, and “going forward, speaking for myself, based on these findings, I will no longer be able to trust that what is presented in CDC summaries to the ACIP is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malone wrote on his blog that he couldn’t discuss future ACIP plans, but experts suspect that the committee may now unwind the RSV recommendation. They fear the group may pull its backing not only for Merck’s antibody, but also for the one made by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Shir-Raz in her post suggested that “the seizure risk is likely a class effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If ACIP does do that, “that’s a tremendous loss for children, and places their health care and their lives in jeopardy,” Romero said. Babies’ lungs are still developing and they’re most vulnerable to RSV. Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s antibody, as well as a new maternal vaccine, have been key tools to protect young children. A CDC report &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/08/cdc-report-suggests-rsv-vaccine-abrysvvo-antibody-shot-beyfortus-reduced-infant-hospitalizations/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that last winter, the first time these new measures were available, there was a substantial drop in RSV hospitalizations among babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy may support withdrawing recommendations for antibodies. When ACIP voted for Merck’s antibody in the last meeting, a CDC director had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, so it was up to Kennedy to decide whether or not to adopt the recommendation; he did not take any action. It was only after Monarez was confirmed as CDC director that she adopted it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland, said these developments are a concerning sign for how the new ACIP will overturn traditional processes as they make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members shouldn’t have voted on the antibody in the last meeting if they felt like they needed more time to review data, because questions and disagreements should be discussed in the official public meetings with health officials and not online after the fact, he said. “It’s not fair to the American public to have that as the deliberative process to make such important decisions for our children.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hepatitis-b"&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the committee will also question the first hepatitis B shot given to infants at birth before they leave the hospital, which anti-vaccine advocates have long targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff raised concerns in his opening remarks in the earlier meeting: “Is it wise to administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to every newborn before leaving the hospital?” he asked. “That’s the question. Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts said that even though mothers are routinely tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy, it’s not a foolproof method. The mother’s status could change after she takes the test, and there could be documentation errors. If infants do acquire hepatitis B from their mothers, the consequences can be devastating — they are at higher risk of lifelong liver infection that may lead to liver cancer or the need for a transplant before they reach 20-years-old. There’s no cure for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The birth dose “is a way of having a complete safety net for those babies,” and there’s no safety reason to remove it, Campbell said. With the current vaccination schedule, the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;getting close&lt;/a&gt; to entirely eliminating hepatitis B cases at birth, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mmrv"&gt;MMRV&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the previous ACIP meeting, Kulldorff raised a concern around MMRV vaccination — that for the first dose given to children between 12 to 47 months old, the combination MMRV shot poses a higher risk of seizure compared with giving two separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines. (The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/vacopt-factsheet-hcp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the seizure risk for the combination shot is about 8 out of every 100,000 children, while the risk for the separate shots is about 4 out of every 100,000.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff then proposed that the MMRV combination should not be administered as the first dose for children under 47 months, since doctors can use the separate shots instead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC already indicates that it prefers the first dose be given as two separate shots, and pediatricians already widely follow that guidance. If the ACIP committee votes to formally withdraw its recommendation for the MMRV combination shot for the first dose, the effects on real-world practice would be minimal, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They noted, though, that they’re concerned with how the seizure risk will be portrayed. “These are nuanced, complex issues, right? But if the takeaway and the headlines are — MMRV causes seizures — then I worry about the way in which the message is being conveyed,” said Scott, the infectious disease specialist at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also fears it’s only a matter of time before ACIP restricts the use of the MMRV combination shot not only for the first dose, but also for subsequent doses for which there is not an increased risk of seizures. Anything that limits vaccinations or adds complexity to vaccination schedules, he said, would be a problem, particularly as the country grapples with increasing numbers of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="59067cd4-22e5-4c23-823f-f76f7f1b032e"&gt;Some of the strongest, fittest people I know are in their 60s (or over), and show no signs of slowing down. Despite being in my 30s, I feel offended when people write off those who are older simply because of age; your strength and overall fitness don’t drop off a cliff just because you’ve hit a new age milestone, and for that reason, your exercise routine shouldn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I encourage people to listen to their bodies and adapt their workout routines accordingly. However, I certainly don’t encourage anyone to stop lifting weights unless they have to, and Eddie Baruta, head of the gym floor at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ultimateperformance.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://ultimateperformance.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ultimate Performance&lt;/a&gt;, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="59067cd4-22e5-4c23-823f-f76f7f1b032e-2"&gt;“Thankfully, the utter BS that people in their 60s are ‘too old’ to start weight training is being dismantled,” he says. “So, too, is the misconception that in your 60s, the best way to stay fit and strong and maintain a healthy weight is to pound the treadmill seven days a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your gym experience, Baruta’s five exercises to build strength, muscle and power in your 60s (and beyond) are must-tries.

"You need to choose exercises that hit that sweet spot between improving your strength and minimizing your risk of injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Baruta says to train for function, longevity and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXCzZkyHeg2EPVV4bqTBxB" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXCzZkyHeg2EPVV4bqTBxB slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lifting too heavy too soon greatly increases the risk of injury, particularly as joints, tendons and connective tissue naturally become less forgiving with age,” he adds. “Instead, older adults should prioritize perfect form, controlled tempo and a full range of motion, which ensures that the right muscles are working properly. It’s not about lifting the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; weight but about lifting &lt;em&gt;well.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-prone-dumbbell-row-batman" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-prone-dumbbell-row-batman"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="fd2b7c41-3c08-45e0-a471-798a75ae1ff1"&gt;“Performing chest-supported rows helps maintain a stable torso and keeps the focus on the target muscles,” Baruta says. "This is particularly beneficial for older trainees who may have weaker spinal stabilizers or a history of lower-back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The support allows safer execution of a pulling movement, strengthening postural muscles that are essential for daily tasks like reaching, pulling and lifting, protecting the lumbar spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups: &lt;/strong&gt;Upper back (rhomboids, mid and lower traps), lats, rear deltoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="98c0d887-8db9-4705-8854-b88ffb88f226"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select your dumbbells and place them on the floor at the head of the bench.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie face down on the bench, making sure that your chin clears the top edge. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bend your legs and drive your feet into the floor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick up the dumbbells one at a time and let your arms hang fully extended by your sides, with your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press your hips into the bench, lift your chest slightly and look at the floor just in front of you.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pinch the shoulder blades together. Keep the elbows pointed out at a 45-degree angle.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your elbows cannot travel any further back without the shoulders rotating inwards and the upper back rounding, pause for a moment and contract the upper back.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reverse the motion, under control, to the start position.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-good-morning" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-good-morning"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

It’s a movement that mimics hip-hinging tasks like picking up objects off the ground,” Baruta says. “When executed properly, it builds the hamstrings, glutes and spinal erectors, which are vital muscles for improving your posture, balance and mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups: &lt;/strong&gt;Hamstrings, glutes, lower back (spinal erectors), core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="923db8e6-0ae1-4927-8064-aa942b01e17e"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Position a barbell across your upper back, just below the base of your neck. Avoid resting it directly on your cervical spine (the neck).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a firm, even grip on the bar, keeping your elbows pointed down to create a stable “shelf” with your upper back muscles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward (or slightly out, depending on comfort and hip mobility).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage your core, take a deep breath into your belly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a slight bend in your knees, push your hips back as if you were closing a door behind you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean your torso forward, maintaining a flat back, until your torso is roughly parallel to the floor (or as far as your hamstring flexibility allows).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive your hips forward and squeeze your glutes to bring your torso upright. Keep the bar stable across your back throughout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="c9a9b18a-4e7d-4f9e-b42b-54534ecc9fb4"&gt;“Don’t relax at the bottom; maintain bracing and tension in your core and lats the entire time," Baruta says. "Only lower as far as your mobility allows while keeping good form. With practice, your range will improve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-farmer-s-walk" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-farmer-s-walk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="29f73b77-fb05-46cd-84a2-ceca00ef3d68"&gt;“The prowler push is a dynamic full-body movement that builds strength, power and cardiovascular capacity through resisted sprinting,” Baruta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those over 60, this makes it an excellent tool for maintaining explosive lower-body strength and metabolic capacity while minimizing the risk of injury. The exercise’s emphasis on sprint-like mechanics also fosters agility and mobility, which are critical components of functionality as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Quadriceps and calves during sprint-style pushes. When heavy, more the glutes and posterior chain due to increased hip flexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="d4d10215-5e65-4343-9d3e-1bf54703d0e2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grab the handles, arms bent or straight. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flex at the hip to allow enough room to push. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the spine neutral. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push and sprint as fast as you can. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-seated-low-pulley-cable-row" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-seated-low-pulley-cable-row"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.

She offers straightforward guidance for anyone concerned about or diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Dr. Zaghiyan stresses the life-saving importance of early screening, particularly colonoscopies, and urges patients to seek second opinions to ensure accurate diagnoses. She warns against unverified remedies and emphasizes taking prompt, informed action when symptoms arise. Her advice highlights how timely medical decisions can dramatically improve outcomes, highlighting the critical role of awareness, professional consultation, and early intervention in combating colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 hard truths about colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Get a colonoscopy early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zaghiyan stresses that everyone should begin colorectal cancer screening at age 45, even if they feel healthy or have no family history. Colonoscopies allow doctors to visually inspect the entire colon and remove precancerous polyps before they develop into cancer. Unlike at-home stool tests, which can miss a significant number of polyps, colonoscopies are more than 95% effective at detecting and preventing colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proper preparation, including dietary adjustments and the use of laxatives, is essential for an accurate examination. Patients should also plan for post-procedure transport due to sedation. Starting screenings early can dramatically increase the chances of detecting cancer at a curable stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Take screening and diagnosis seriously&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection is critical in improving survival rates for colorectal cancer patients. Dr. Zaghiyan notes that patients diagnosed at stage one have around a 90% chance of surviving at least five years, while those diagnosed at stage four have only a 10% five-year survival rate. Symptoms like rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, fatigue, or unexplained weight loss should never be ignored. Delaying medical attention or dismissing these signs as minor issues can allow the disease to progress, making treatment far more complicated and reducing the likelihood of a positive outcome. Taking diagnosis and screening seriously can be the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Seek second opinions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zaghiyan strongly recommends getting a second opinion for any diagnosis or if symptoms are concerning. Misdiagnoses are not uncommon, and consulting multiple experts ensures that patients receive the most accurate assessment and treatment plan. For instance, rectal bleeding might be incorrectly attributed to hemorrhoids without proper examination. Patients should feel empowered to ask questions, challenge their care plans, and consult additional specialists if necessary. Taking the extra step to verify your diagnosis can prevent mistakes and provide access to the latest treatment options, potentially saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Avoid unverified remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online advice and alternative treatments can be misleading or harmful. Dr. Zaghiyan warns against trusting unproven cures, such as extreme diets, supplements, or home remedies promoted online. Instead, patients should rely on evidence-based medical treatments and consult registered cancer dietitians to safely complement conventional therapy. For those seeking innovative approaches, enrolling in clinical trials with rigorous oversight is far safer than following anecdotal or unverified claims. Sticking to verified medical advice increases the likelihood of successful treatment and minimizes unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Act timely and follow medical guidance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying treatment is one of the most dangerous decisions a patient can make. Dr. Zaghiyan emphasizes that once concerning symptoms appear or a diagnosis is confirmed, timely action can mean the difference between curable and advanced disease. Following your doctor’s recommendations without unnecessary delay, adhering to medication schedules, and attending follow-up appointments is crucial. Patients should avoid waiting to “see if it goes away” and instead act promptly, as early intervention substantially increases survival chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms and &lt;keyword id="28671010" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="risks-of-colon-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;risks of colon cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer often develops silently, showing few or no symptoms in its early stages.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is a viral, sometimes fatal disease transmitted by an infected midge, or biting fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The disease can only be spread through the fly, not from deer to deer, according to the DNR, and there is no evidence that humans, pets or wildlife can contract the virus. While it is not recommended to eat visibly sick animals, deer hunted from areas where epizootic hemorrhagic disease is present is safe to eat, the DNR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“In past years when we've confirmed EHD, it has typically affected only one or a few counties,” said Brent Rudolph, deer, elk and moose management specialist for the DNR Wildlife Division. “Occasionally, localized outbreaks have been detected in a dozen or more counties, including as many as 30 in 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Anyone who finds a deer that has contracted or died from epizootic hemorrhagic disease can submit a diseased wildlife report through the DNR’s &lt;u&gt;Eyes in the Field&lt;/u&gt; online system. Symptoms in deer may include appearing lethargic, disoriented, lame or unresponsive, and they may have bloody discharge from the nose and mouth, a swollen or blue-tinged tongue and swelling of the eyelids and around the neck or head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;kberg@detroitnews.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 05:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_gFBVV95cUxNVEJ6R2gtYXBReXNndUlCcDJQalNNcmgyRnBXTldyaVdDeXR0MTVUV0ZqUUZIQ3oxYVBna0ZtNXBmUnhVakhPN2lwR0YzZWJoUXVtdkpmNHEzODFZb1NTUWh5OHVSdDNtczFPV19nXzN3NjRxc0Vic1RXYWJwcmlHTGhXLW4xWFh4VmUxXzZHTDh4ZlE5Rm5pTGFQU29HRjBpaDlOMGtiWUZQNlJPakEtZWlNZllsUUdtd0swcHlIejY2WC1EOGxfMk1nb1h0Q09INVp0NnNsRkotdUZXZWZTM01nYWM2YXN5M3BpcjlPTXFKU3ViWGpyc3Z4ZEJSQQ</guid></item><item><title>突破性的血压治疗即使在其他人失败时也能发挥作用- Yahoo News Canada</title><link>https://ca.news.yahoo.com/breakthrough-blood-pressure-treatment-found-073844446.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/drug" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Normally, I’d start this sort of article by saying something along the lines of, “Everyone knows how horrible it is to feel motion sick.” But that’s not entirely true—plenty of people can text, read, and do all sorts of things in a moving vehicle without feeling the slightest bit nauseous. If that sounds like you, you’ll have to trust me—a chronic sufferer of motion sickness—when I say that it wholeheartedly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plus, many drugs used for motion sickness come with an unwanted side effect: drowsiness. While that’s useful for a long-haul red-eye, it definitely kills the mood on a road trip. That’s why researchers have looked into whether music can help people recover from carsickness, and they might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” Qizong Yue, a researcher at Southwest University in China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Simulated carsickness hell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.163610"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Yue and colleagues induced carsickness in study participants with a driving simulator (you couldn’t pay me enough to get into that) and then played different types of music while monitoring them for potential recovery. According to their results, soft and joyful music best supported recovery. Perhaps surprisingly, even sad music was worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team divided the 30 participants, who had reported moderate levels of previous carsickness, into six groups—four who listened to music as they recovered from motion sickness, one who didn’t, and one whose simulations stopped before the participant became carsick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wore &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875"&gt;electroencephalogram&lt;/a&gt; (EEG) caps—tools that measure electrical activity in the brain. The researchers hoped to identify brain signals indicative of carsickness by comparing the neural activity of the first five groups with that of the sixth group—the one for which the simulation stopped before participants could become nauseous (ok, maybe you could pay me to be in group six).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers first measured each participant’s EEG signals as they sat still in the simulator. The participants subsequently underwent a driving task and communicated their level of carsickness. At the end of the task, some participants listened to music for 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team then asked them how carsick they still were. The participants reported that joyful music reduced carsickness by 57.3%, soft music reduced it by 56.7%, and passionate music by 48.3%. While those who didn’t listen to music reported 43.3% fewer carsickness symptoms after the 60 seconds, participants who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that soft music might relax tensions that worsen carsickness, and joyful music may provide a distraction by triggering brain reward systems. Sad music could aggravate negative feelings and, as a result, worsen a person’s general discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your brain when you’re motion sick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the EEG data revealed changes in participants’ occipital lobe brain activity when they said they were carsick. Specifically, the device recorded less complex activity when participants reported feeling significantly nauseous. As they recovered, brain activity in this area gradually returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” Yue explained. “The primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, “the primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,” the researcher added. “This constraint results in limited statistical power.” What’s more, one’s brain might react differently to a simulation than real-life conditions. In other words, more research with larger samples is needed to confirm both the carsickness brain activity patterns and to continue investigating the impact of music on motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the team will study different types of motion sickness and the influence of music taste. And if any of the researchers are reading this article, I’d like to suggest investigating the anecdotal evidence of how singing helps prevent and/or recover from motion sickness. It would finally prove to my family that I literally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to belt out the lyrics to all of Taylor Swift’s songs when we hit those windy roads.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, health authorities have warned against red meat consumption, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; research arm classifying it as "probably carcinogenic to humans". But a controversial &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; challenges that position, suggesting that animal protein might protect against cancer deaths rather than cause them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)&lt;/a&gt;, part of the WHO, has long classified red meat, including beef, pork, lamb and mutton, as probably carcinogenic. And processed meats such as bacon and sausages are classified as definite carcinogens. This judgment reflects multiple studies linking red meat to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01646-1"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming the basis of dietary advice to limit intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the new research by Canada's McMaster University suggests the opposite: that people who consume more animal protein may actually have &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;lower cancer mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;. But, before you rush out to buy a pack of sausages, there are some important points you should note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methods contain important nuances that complicate its &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/eating-meat-could-protect-against-cancer-related-death-study-suggests"&gt;headline-grabbing conclusions&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than examining red meat specifically, the researchers analysed consumption of "animal protein", a broad category that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/11/1771"&gt;includes red meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. This distinction matters significantly because fish, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/640"&gt;oily varieties such as mackerel and sardines&lt;/a&gt;, are associated with being cancer-protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By grouping all animal proteins together, the study may have captured the protective effects of fish and certain dairy products rather than proving the safety of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy products themselves present a complex picture in cancer research. Some studies suggest they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322002095?via%3Dihub"&gt;reduce colorectal cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; while potentially &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/association-between-dairy-products-consumption-and-prostate-cancer-risk-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/ADBD3EA24DE6E07CE23E0F110012916C"&gt;increasing prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. This mixed evidence underscores how the broad "animal protein" category obscures important distinctions between different food types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.ncba.org/"&gt;National Cattlemen's Beef Association&lt;/a&gt;, America's primary beef industry lobbying group, contains several other limitations. Crucially, the researchers didn't distinguish between processed and unprocessed meats – a distinction that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01635580701684872"&gt;countless studies have shown to be vital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as bacon, sausages and deli meats consistently show higher cancer risks than fresh, unprocessed cuts. Additionally, the research didn't examine specific cancer types, making it impossible to determine whether the protective effects apply broadly or to particular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also examined plant proteins, including legumes, nuts and soy products such as tofu, and found they had no strong protective effect against dying of cancer. This finding contradicts previous research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-025-00688-3#Sec11"&gt;plant proteins are linked to decreased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, adding another layer of complexity to an already confusing picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don't diminish the established health benefits of plant-based foods, which provide fibre, antioxidants and other compounds associated with reduced disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg" alt="salad with numerous items" class="wp-image-151583 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study doesn't undermine the wealth of evidence that plant-based foods are good for you.

Excessive red meat intake remains linked to other serious health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/85/1-2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000224"&gt;heart disease and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The key lies in moderation and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflicting research highlights the complexity of nutrition science, where isolating the effects of individual foods proves remarkably difficult. People don't eat single nutrients in isolation – they consume complex combinations of foods as part of broader lifestyle patterns. It's more important to focus on overall dietary patterns rather than fixating on individual foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/12/1947"&gt;balanced plate approach&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a variety of protein sources, plenty of vegetables and fruits, and minimally processed foods, remains the most evidence-based path to optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this latest study adds a new dimension to the meat debate, it's unlikely to be the final word. As nutrition science continues to evolve, the most prudent approach remains the least dramatic: moderation, variety and balance in all things.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264088/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Researchers have developed plant-based microbeads that block fat absorption in the gut.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current strategies for weight loss, such as gastric bypass surgery or medications that block fat absorption, often come with significant risks or unpleasant side effects. Scientists are now exploring a different option: edible microbeads made from green tea polyphenols, vitamin E, and seaweed. Once swallowed, these beads attach to dietary fats inside the digestive tract. Early studies in rats that were fed high-fat diets suggest this method could provide a safer and more widely available alternative to traditional surgery or drug-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yue Wu, a graduate student at Sichuan University, is scheduled to present the team’s findings at the ACS Fall 2025 Digital Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing weight can help some people prevent long-term health issues like diabetes and heart disease,” says Wu. “Our microbeads work directly in the gut to block fat absorption in a noninvasive and gentle way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Challenge of Fat Absorption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight gain can be influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors, one of the most important being diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a high-fat diet is defined as one in which 35% or more of daily calories come from fat rather than protein or carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some approved drugs, such as orlistat, reduce fat absorption by interfering with the enzymes that break down dietary fats. While effective, orlistat has been linked to serious side effects in certain patients, including damage to the liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Wu and her colleagues wanted to target the fat absorption process with their weight-loss intervention but do so without negative side effects. “We want to develop something that works with how people normally eat and live,” says Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490711" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490711" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-777x777.jpg" alt="Fat Trapping Microbeads" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-777x777.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-400x400.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-150x150.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-768x768.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-450x450.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-1200x1201.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490711" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;These plant-based microbeads absorb and trap fat. Credit: Yue Wu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, the team created tiny plant-based beads that spontaneously form through a series of chemical bonds between the green tea polyphenols and vitamin E. These structures can form chemical tethers to fat droplets and serve as the fat-binding core of the microbeads. The researchers then coated the spheres in a natural polymer derived from seaweed to protect them from the acidic environment of the stomach. Once ingested, the protective polymer coating expands in response to the acidic pH, and the green tea polyphenols and vitamin E compounds bind to and trap partially digested fats in the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Integrating Microbeads into Diets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbeads are nearly flavorless, and the researchers foresee them being easily integrated into people’s diets. For example, the microbeads could be made into small tapioca- or boba-sized balls and added to desserts and bubble teas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the microbeads as a weight-loss treatment in rats. They put the animals into three groups (eight rats per group), those which were fed a high-fat diet (60% fats) either with or without microbeads and those which were fed a normal diet (10% fats) for 30 days. Rats fed the high-fat diet and microbeads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lost 17% of their total body weight, while rats in the other groups didn’t lose weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had reduced adipose tissue and less liver damage compared to rats fed the high-fat and normal diets without microbeads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excreted more fat in their feces compared to rats not given microbeads. The extra fat in the rats’ feces had no apparent ill effects on the animals’ health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the eight rats on high-fat diets that consumed microbeads showed similar intestinal fat excretion, but without the gastrointestinal side effects the researchers observed with a fourth group of rats they treated with orlistat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu and her team have started working with a biotechnology company to manufacture the plant-based beads. “All the ingredients are food grade and FDA-approved, and their production can be easily scaled up,” says Yunxiang He, Sichuan University associate professor and co-author on Wu’s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve also initiated a human clinical trial in collaboration with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. “This represents a major step toward clinical translation of our polyphenol-based microbeads, following our foundational results,” says Wu. “We have officially enrolled 26 participants in our investigator-initiated trial, and we anticipate that preliminary data may become available within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting: ACS Fall 2025&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;They have been promoted as a remedy for anxiety and sleeplessness, with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlskNOvFJQW/?taken-by=myblanquil"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and influencers swearing by their calming effects. Weighted blankets – heavy throws filled with glass beads or plastic pellets – have gone from a niche therapeutic tool to a mainstream wellness must-have, promising better sleep and reduced stress for anyone struggling to unwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do they deliver on these bold claims, or are we simply paying premium prices for an expensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weighted-blankets-really-can-do-wonders-for-a-good-nights-sleep"&gt;Weighted Blankets Really Can Do Wonders For a Good Night's Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists have used weighted blankets since the 1970s to help children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and adults with sensory processing disorders. They became commercially available in the 1990s, but remained largely within special needs communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed dramatically in recent years when companies began targeting what they call the "casually anxious" – essentially, anyone struggling with modern life's stresses. The marketing worked: Time magazine even named the weighted blanket one of the &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454469/gravity-blanket/"&gt;top 50 "inventions" of 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept behind weighted blankets is appealingly simple. Typically weighing between two and 13 kilograms (experts &lt;a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/sleep/sleep-help/how-do-weighted-blankets-work/"&gt;recommend choosing one that's 10% of your body weight&lt;/a&gt;), they use what occupational therapists call "deep pressure stimulation". The gentle, even pressure across your body mimics the sensation of being held or hugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research picture is more nuanced than the marketing suggests. Several studies do show promising results, but with important qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7970589/"&gt;study of 120 psychiatric outpatients&lt;/a&gt; found that weighted blankets improved insomnia symptoms over four weeks in people with major  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded they were "a safe and effective intervention for insomnia in patients with some mental health disorders".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller studies have shown similar patterns. One found that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05"&gt;63% of adults reported lower anxiety&lt;/a&gt; after just five minutes under a weighted blanket, while another study of psychiatric inpatients found &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0164212X.2015.1066220"&gt;60% experienced reduced anxiety&lt;/a&gt; during their hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies all focused on people with diagnosed mental health conditions, not the general population that companies are now targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the science diverges from the marketing: reviews of the research consistently show that benefits for healthy people are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38686123/"&gt;much harder to prove&lt;/a&gt;. While weighted blankets may help people with clinical anxiety or sleep disorders, there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39341068/"&gt;insufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they benefit casual users without existing mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, about half the research on weighted blankets &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32204779/"&gt;doesn't meet quality standards&lt;/a&gt; for robust scientific evidence – a significant problem given the confident health claims found on product websites and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a28713038/weighted-blanket-health-benefits/"&gt;glowing reviews&lt;/a&gt; in lifestyle magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who might benefit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean weighted blankets are entirely useless for healthy people. Shift workers, who must sleep during daylight hours when their brains are naturally alert, might find them helpful for combating the known health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896"&gt;irregular schedules&lt;/a&gt;. Healthcare workers, firefighters and pilots who rely on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37061-9"&gt;strategic power naps&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from faster sleep onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect also shouldn't be dismissed. If a weighted blanket helps you feel calmer and sleep better, even if the mechanism isn't what manufacturers claim, that's still a positive outcome, provided you understand what you're buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighted blankets do carry some risks. They shouldn't be used by anyone who cannot easily move beneath their weight, including young children. People with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, sleep apnoea, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/"&gt;COPD&lt;/a&gt;, circulation problems, high blood pressure or claustrophobia should consult their GP before opting to use one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No studies have reported serious harms, but common sense suggests checking with a healthcare provider if you have underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a low-risk intervention that might complement &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10105495/"&gt;good sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/benefits-of-sleep"&gt;regular sleep cycles&lt;/a&gt;, weighted blankets aren't inherently problematic. The issue lies in overselling their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering buying one, be realistic about your expectations. You're not buying a miracle cure for modern anxiety but rather a potentially comforting sleep aid that might help you feel more settled at bedtime. For many people struggling with sleep, that gentle pressure and sense of security could be worth the investment, even if the science behind it isn't quite as solid as the marketing suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real question isn't whether weighted blankets work, but whether they work for you, and whether the premium price is justified for what might ultimately be an expensive hug.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263591/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 70-year-old woman became the first in Massachusetts to test positive for West Nile virus this year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-human-case-of-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was exposed to the disease in Middlesex County, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department did not disclose details about specifically where or when the woman was exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne virus can be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mosquitos positive for West Nile virus were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; June 17, found in Boston’s West Roxbury and Hyde Park neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/08/13/the-risk-for-west-nile-virus-is-now-high-in-10-mass-communities-heres-what-to-know/"&gt;warned residents&lt;/a&gt; in early August about the rise of the virus, declaring the risk to be “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current risk for the virus is high in 10 municipalities in Suffolk and Middlesex counties, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, there have been 319 West Nile-positive mosquito samples so far, the department said. In July, a goat in Lunenburg was the first animal to be infected with the virus in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “While September brings cooler air and the return to school for many in the state, the risk from WNV is going to be elevated for some time. Residents should continue to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites,” said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; residents to be wary of the mosquitos, and take proper precautions like applying insect repellent when outdoors, draining standing water, and installing or repairing window screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mosquitoes will be with us until the first hard frost,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine M. Brown. “People should use mosquito repellent with an EPA-registered active ingredient, clothing to reduce exposed skin, and consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-west-nile-virus-positive-mosquito-sample-0"&gt;19 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2024 and &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-risk-level-changes-for-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;six cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) may play a significant role in brain aging, a new study reveals, giving scientists a new target for understanding and potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-rapidly-aged-in-the-pandemic-and-it-wasnt-just-the-virus"&gt;brain deterioration&lt;/a&gt; and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 was brought to light through a careful comparison of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; part of the brain in mice of different ages. The hippocampus is involved in memory and learning, and it is one of the regions that suffers most from age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team found that FLT1 was the one protein in this region that old mice had more of and young mice had less of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by a team from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the researchers are hopeful that their findings will enlighten human treatments for neurodegenerative conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-brain-scan-halfway-through-your-life-can-reveal-how-fast-youre-aging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Single Brain Scan Halfway Through Your Life Can Reveal How Fast You're Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 is known to be related to storing iron in the body, but hasn't come up in relation to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; before. To test its involvement after their initial findings, the researchers used genetic editing to overexpress the protein in young mice, and reduce its level in old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg" alt="Cultured neurons" class="wp-image-172283 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neurons with a lot of FTL1 (right) had fewer branching arms, a sign of lower connectivity. (Remesal et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: the younger mice showed signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;impaired memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning abilities, as if they were getting old before their time, while in the older mice there were signs of restored cognitive function – some of the brain aging was effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves, this has only been demonstrated in mouse models, and there's a lot of work to do before this can be confirmed in people, but the early signs are promising when it comes to keeping older brains in a healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is truly a reversal of impairments," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Saul Villeda, from UCSF. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on cells in petri dishes showed how FTL1 stopped neurons from growing properly, with neural wires lacking the branching structures that typically provide links between nerve cells and improve brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the analysis carried out by the researchers, it seems that increased FTL1 may interfere with the mitochondria that act as the power stations of our cells. Mitochondria are closely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.028"&gt;linked to aging&lt;/a&gt; – it's as if they're light bulbs that get dimmer and dimmer as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;studying aging&lt;/a&gt; is picking apart which changes in the body are the result of aging, and which changes might be driving it. Through the collection of tests run here, it seems FTL1 is one of those drivers – at least in the hippocampuses of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can now look at how this might be applied to people, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172280" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;and Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. It's also going to be important to find out more about how FTL1 affects the brain, and what the full set of consequences of limiting it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Villeda. "It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;COVID context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all trials, there are limitations. As mentioned, the number of infections here is small—the impressive efficacy numbers could potentially vanish in a larger trial with more infections. And, while the trial had a high-quality design, it was undertaken in just one location in Germany and mostly involved healthy white women between the ages of 20 and 46, so the findings are not generalizable. The study was also funded by a pharmaceutical company that makes an azelastine nasal spray (though not the one that is sold over the counter in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the previous studies, the trial offers some hope that this accessible nasal spray could be used as a viral prophylactic for respiratory seasons in the future. And the results land at a time when access to COVID-19 vaccines—which have firmly proven to be safe and highly effective—has been severely restricted in the US by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, it appears that only people ages 65 and over, and those at higher risk of COVID-19 will have access to the shots this year, though some aspects of that access are murky, including how people will prove they're at high risk. For healthy children, teens, and adults under 65, there may be no access or extremely limited access. That includes groups that medical experts recommend get vaccinated, namely healthy pregnant people and children ages 6 months to 23 months, both of which are considered at high risk from COVID-19 by medical experts, but not federal guidance under Kennedy. Experts also recommend access for healthy people who have contact with vulnerable people, such as cancer doctors, people who live with immunocompromised family members, and people who work in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited vaccine access and the normal slew of respiratory viruses on the horizon, a simple nasal spray is an appealing addition to the defenses. The main side effects are fairly minor, including bitter taste in the mouth, nosebleeds, and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;
