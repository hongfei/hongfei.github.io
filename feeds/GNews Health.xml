Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn’t been “safety tested” and its protection is short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the “most effective way” to prevent the virus’ spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;In an interview&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862" target="_blank"&gt;are no approved treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, which &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many medical experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;taken issue with his approach&lt;/a&gt; to the current measles outbreak, which has included &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasizing unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines — a notion doctors say is false. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That’s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,” said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Aside from occasional outbreaks, measles hasn’t been constantly present in the United States since before 2000. It is introduced locally by international travelers, and from there it can spread among undervaccinated communities.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The federal government’s position is, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The federal government doesn’t mandate childhood vaccines; rather, all 50 states require them for children attending public school. The FDA approves vaccines based on safety and efficacy, and the CDC makes recommendations about who should get them, which states often choose to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" target="_blank"&gt;all 50 states have exemptions to vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and all but five have additional exemptions for other reasons, such as religious or personal objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current outbreak was fueled by transmission in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. There have been 668 total cases since January, according to NBC News’ tally, including two pediatric deaths and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;one suspected death in an unvaccinated adult&lt;/a&gt;. Before those deaths, the United States hadn’t had a measles death in a decade, and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm#" target="_blank"&gt;child hadn’t died of measles&lt;/a&gt; since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/rfk-jr-pushes-fluoride-policy-review-cites-autism-concerns-237047877801" target="_blank"&gt;pointed to higher case numbers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that the United States is responding appropriately to the outbreak. But the figure he has cited recently — roughly 127,000 measles cases in Europe — is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank"&gt;the total for last year across 53 countries&lt;/a&gt;. Low vaccination rates in southeastern Europe were a major contributor, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He has this way of kind of twisting things,” said Dr. William Moss, director of the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. “We should be comparing measles in the United States this year to measles in the United States and prior years. To say Europe has more cases over one year than we’ve had in three months this year, it’s just a false comparison.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This year’s count in the United States is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-measles-cases-2024-so-far-rcna145013" target="_blank"&gt;highest since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Doctors fear the United States could be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" target="_blank"&gt;on the verge of losing its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; as Kennedy continues to sow doubt about vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Right now we don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” Kennedy told CBS News. “Many of the vaccines are only tested for three or four days with no placebo group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, said vaccine development usually takes 10 to 20 years, with the notable exception of Covid shots, which were brought to market in less than a year thanks to mRNA technology and a coordinated, worldwide effort. (Even then, the &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/publications-and-special-projects/penn-medicine-magazine/winter-2022/from-foundational-discoveries-to-pandemic-proliferation-of-impact" target="_blank"&gt;foundational research behind mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; dates to 1997.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When it comes to childhood immunizations, many of which were approved decades ago, there may not have been placebo controls or long-term safety follow-ups for each one, Levy said. However, he noted that even after vaccines are approved, various government-led surveillance systems monitor for adverse reactions. And in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2726" target="_blank"&gt;rare case they find anything&lt;/a&gt;, that vaccine is pulled from the market, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Moss agreed that the types of clinical trials for vaccines have changed over time. However, “I don’t think there’s any other product we use that’s more rigorously evaluated for both safety and efficacy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said Kennedy “just keeps picking and picking” at vaccine safety with statements that aren’t scientifically valid — for instance, by suggesting that &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1819855873801392393" target="_blank"&gt;all childhood vaccines weren’t tested against placebos&lt;/a&gt;, when, in fact, many were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The problem with RFK Jr. is his definition of ‘placebo,’” Offit said. “His definition of placebo is either water or saline, meaning just normal sodium chloride, but that’s not the FDA’s definition. The FDA’s definition is something that’s inert.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy “raised valid concerns about vaccine trial practices, including the use of active comparators instead of inert placebos and short observation windows — issues backed by public data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors said there’s a legitimate reason to use active comparators — vaccines that have already been approved for given infections — instead of placebos: It would be unethical to withhold the benefit of a vaccine from study participants, so trials often test new vaccines against older versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Levy said there’s always room for more safety studies or longer-term follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I think the secretary is right that we could do more to study vaccine safety,” he said. “By all means, let’s dig in. Let’s see, did we miss anything? Should we learn more? But let’s not forget that these vaccines in childhood have averted severe disease in children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNQThWSTlaNDlHMUJrU0pVR0FaaDU4RndEVnBzWkFvbEluQm1DbUFlWWw0NzlheU13ZlJRQzFfMUZvdmpMd29KMlVKNGsxdjZJb1lPV3dpX1gtc09Zd2ZISV95allnT29RUk4tTzJGQ2ZUU2Z1UEo2Y08wcjVLYmxieDVqV1pHNld5MVlTaWpVQVUwd3c2NnhxZWY4OWRuSE9hWF8tMDZrRXVmalBjUXcxUjRwVETSAVZBVV95cUxOSVlFRTdRWE1TYXRsMndFV3F2S2hLSXRqVldTOFNZZXFXM1h0dHBJMlhzNlY0bl9NamJ1UmdzZXZKRkl6YWZ1SFZCaGJfaEx6bGVJQ0V1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Popular Diabetes Drug Linked to 45% Lower Dementia Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQanh5YURBSExvVDlmQVZ3WUFvMEJOS09GVUVqbGdvRS1NbGs2R3ljQk1ZeGhNdXZxaTAwYzl2dllzZ0FSUERFWVlLRm1INjY2RFl0V0ZTY3VCUi10U3h5SkFfcERtb3NkTlBNbk9EWDV6RUNaWVUtUlhaY2lIVU9laDB4MllTMDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 08:26:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQanh5YURBSExvVDlmQVZ3WUFvMEJOS09GVUVqbGdvRS1NbGs2R3ljQk1ZeGhNdXZxaTAwYzl2dllzZ0FSUERFWVlLRm1INjY2RFl0V0ZTY3VCUi10U3h5SkFfcERtb3NkTlBNbk9EWDV6RUNaWVUtUlhaY2lIVU9laDB4MllTMDA</guid></item><item><title>New Gold Standard for Cholesterol Treatment Could Prevent 330,000 Deaths a Year - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOd2dmUlRCdndtMU9DQVB2dDN4RHEwLUNCRGlhb1FUc3ItT3RpbEhQRWNlZFZMWVhhRmRaeFFFZjI2OXA1ZnhCMGRrRVNtQ1laQlV4UnBRN2J0TXdWOERwVEU0cU0zWEw0MDVWV3J1Vzd5aW1sNXhfMnRrRDFqMy1BLUViWU1hRkNGNFN3WFZpWGhWTW9IeXItUk1hX0FYd1NJbVBuempJZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 03:57:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOd2dmUlRCdndtMU9DQVB2dDN4RHEwLUNCRGlhb1FUc3ItT3RpbEhQRWNlZFZMWVhhRmRaeFFFZjI2OXA1ZnhCMGRrRVNtQ1laQlV4UnBRN2J0TXdWOERwVEU0cU0zWEw0MDVWV3J1Vzd5aW1sNXhfMnRrRDFqMy1BLUViWU1hRkNGNFN3WFZpWGhWTW9IeXItUk1hX0FYd1NJbVBuempJZw</guid></item><item><title>AI, dementia and supplements: The week in Well+Being - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQTTBmX0U2Zm5iYlJmYmI0YXJhb19OX19ja1JDWmFMMk9KRkY1MlNfWWpJSWpadGIxQ0dybVJyQ3ZsdWNsOXpzY2RvMmRUU0FpYTA2ZW01d0NaY3poMldMbHVTMld4dDhVT0ZNN3FKclM0N3ZhRHJmZS1GUWZBbUw3QTdlZ2UyOTE0amNrNHhHRXhxYWNiRlVVdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VXCRPZVRSNF3BLTL5ZCMV7R5S4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are reading our weekly Well+Being newsletter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/well-being/?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=ART&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ZGRHZ6ZZZFXRAMGLXAPQFSEJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Happy Thursday!

It was just spewing out of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was holding his neck and when I took a look the blood was spitting from his neck. He didn't go completely through the window and his hip to his legs were hanging out so he was able to pull himself back in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Horrifying images show a gaping &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14333019/Pictured-mother-died-chiropractor-neck-crack-workout.html"&gt;four inch wide, 1.5 inch deep hole&lt;/a&gt; running across his neck, from the mouth to his ear - barely missing his jugular veins that are responsible for bringing blood back from the brain to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aceson Dubois, now five, nearly died last year after he went through a window and ended up with a massive wound on his neck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even minor damage to the jugular veins can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage, blood clots in the vein, inflammation of the vein wall and infections - all of which could cause serious brain damage and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa is now calling on parents to protect their children by installing safety guards all around their homes and learn how to treat wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Remembering how she attempted first aid to&lt;span&gt; stop the flow of 'spitting' blood and waited for emergency services, the young mother said: 'I was terrified, I thought that was it. I thought he had hit a main artery and was going to die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I grabbed his neck and pinched everything I could. I used the laundry that we had on the couch and I began to stuff his neck and had [the wound] closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hands were slipping all over my son because of all the blood all over him. He was just screaming on the porch and kept saying "mommy, please don't let me die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It [the glass] missed his jugular [veins] by an inch. He ended up slicing his saliva gland in half and the bottom half of his ear off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The saliva, or salivary, glands are located in the head and neck region and are responsible for lubricating the mouth, swallowing, digestion and protect teeth against harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Aceson reached the McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, South Carolina, he immediately underwent a two-hour emergency surgery to have his neck, saliva gland and ear stitched back together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa said: 'The whole time while I was waiting for him to come out of his first surgery, I couldn't stop shaking and I felt sick.

Breitbart has been a plastic surgeon for more than 30 years and he has now told DailyMail.com that the safest plastic surgical procedures are the minimally invasive ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in his opinion, one of the absolute safest body alterations is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/liposuction/index.html" id="mol-2d570860-163d-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b"&gt;liposuction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The incisions are tiny and the procedure is commonly performed in an office operating room, usually under local anesthesia,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart has been performing liposuction procedures for as long as he's been a plastic surgeon and has done thousands on this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, they're so common that he does several of these surgeries a week in his office operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Arnold Breitbart has been a plastic surgeon for more than 30 years and says liposuction is one of the safest procedures possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Breitbart performs several liposuction surgeries a week (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I operate with advanced liposuction techniques such as SmartLipo, which uses a laser during the liposuction procedure to make the liposuction more effective,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart explained that these liposuction procedures are likely popular because they're ideal for patients who may be close to their ideal weight, but have areas where they want to get rid of fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that liposuction is most commonly performed on areas including the abdomen, the flanks (also known as love handles), out and inner thighs, inner knees, the back, arms, and neck.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've performed liposuction on professional models, trainers, and athletes, who despite excellent diet, exercise, and lifestyle, still have these disproportionate areas of increased fatty fullness,' Dr. Breitbart said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Liposuction may be appropriate for somewhat heavier patients, but generally not for obese patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients find liposuction to be a very attractive procedure, as the procedure is outpatient and the recovery is quick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while liposuction is popular, Dr. Breitbart said that he's seen an increase in patients seeking plastic surgery for the removal of lose skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is mostly due to the recent rise in GLP-1 weight loss medications like Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liposuction is typically performed on patients who might be close to their ideal weight but have a few 'problem areas' they want to fix (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In these massive weight loss patients, loose skin is a common secondary effect,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may affect parts of the body including the abdomen, arms, breasts, and face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Procedures such as tummy tuck, arm lift, breast lift, facelift, and necklift may be indicated in these patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart agrees that patients should probably steer clear of dangerous procedures like BBLs mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, I discourage the use of implants placed in the buttocks, as there are increased complication rates associated with this procedure,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if you're looking for a procedure that will give you bigger buttocks, he said to at least consider a fat transfer first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/news/2025/seafood-children.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In this latest study – of the children of the children of the 90s – scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development.

                    &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told staff this week to start planning for the agency’s splintering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several parts of CDC — mostly those devoted to health threats that aren’t infectious — are being spun off into the soon-to-be-created Administration for a Healthy America, the agency official told senior leaders in calls and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive came from Dr. Debra Houry, the agency’s chief medical officer, according to three CDC officials who were in attendance. They declined to be identified because they weren’t authorized to talk about the plans and fear being fired if they were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/employees-say-a-plan-to-reorganize-hhs-will-have-health-and-safety-consequences"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Employees say a plan to reorganize HHS will have health and safety consequences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment, Houry referred The Associated Press to CDC media relations representatives. CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald acknowledged the agency is planning for possible changes but that “none of the items discussed at the meeting have been finalized, and are subject to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there are “a lot more questions than there are answers right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those questions include whether the split will interrupt funding and assistance to state health departments that ultimately implement federal health policy, said Harris, who also is Alabama’s state health officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’d love to be able to give input,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials deciding what to do with programs that lost many staffers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based CDC is charged with protecting Americans from preventable health threats. It had roughly 13,000 employees at the beginning of the year, the bulk of them in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has embarked on a dramatic downsizing of many federal agencies. The CDC’s headcount was slashed by rounds of early retirements and layoffs that reduced staffing by 3,500 to 4,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layoffs targeted not just job classifications but offices and programs. For example, everyone at the CDC’s division on dental health was axed, as were most workers at an office that investigates occupational diseases and promotes job safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fda-reverses-course-on-telework-after-staff-reductions-threaten-basic-operations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA reverses course on telework after staff reductions threaten basic operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, federal health officials are deciding how to reassemble what’s left. They have a Monday deadline to submit a reorganization plan to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has already outlined plans for the new Administration for a Healthy America, which would largely focus on health problems not caused by infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a statement last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experts wonder whether CDC workers would have to move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said the AHA will contain — among other things — the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the U.S. Surgeon General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meetings this week, Houry said the new AHA agency also will likely absorb what’s left of the CDC centers devoted to birth defects, chronic conditions, environmental health, injuries, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear if those staffers would stay in Atlanta — and that “deeply matters,” said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who studies government health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-orders-hhs-to-determine-the-cause-of-autism-by-september"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; RFK Jr. orders HHS to determine the cause of autism by September&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those jobs are moved to the Washington, D.C., area, “you certainly are going to lose lots of the kinds of experts who have built lives and careers and families in and around Atlanta, many of whom I’m sure would be unable or unwilling to relocate their lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would likely mean “you are building something anew, rather than just changing reporting lines,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CDC’s remaining HIV staff would be moved to new agency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of CDC not being moved into the AHA would be be mainly focused on infectious diseases, with one notable exception: HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s HIV prevention staff was decimated in the layoffs, with 160 people eliminated. What’s left — the agency’s HIV surveillance and lab operations, for example — would shift to the AHA under the realignment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-will-tell-cdc-to-stop-recommending-fluoride-in-drinking-water"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; RFK Jr. will tell CDC to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a change would place that CDC work under the same organizational umbrella as HRSA’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. That program provides outpatient care, treatment and support services to people with HIV but no health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cleaving of the CDC was proposed in Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation government-shrinking proposal that surfaced last year. That document called the CDC “the most incompetent and arrogant agency in the federal government” and proposed splitting it into two smaller agencies — one focused on disease data collection and the other more generally on public health.&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the search for better ways to treat diabetes, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.unige.ch/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Geneva;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt; have uncovered a promising new approach that could reshape how this disease is managed. At the center of their discovery is a protein called S100A9, which has been shown to reduce dangerous levels of ketones in the blood—without relying on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with type 1 diabetes or those with severe insulin deficiency, life depends on daily injections of insulin. While insulin therapy has saved millions of lives, it’s far from perfect. It’s difficult to dose, can cause serious side effects, and often leads to complications like hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening condition. Researchers at the University of Geneva are now working on a treatment that could support or even replace insulin in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Body’s Ketone System&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, your body creates &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-boost-brain-function-and-guard-against-diabetes-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ketones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt; as a backup energy source during long periods without food. This process—called ketogenesis—happens in liver cells called hepatocytes. It turns fat into ketone bodies like acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate. These molecules travel through the blood and help fuel other tissues in the body, including the brain and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Roberto Coppari, Gloria Ursino and Giorgio Ramadori (from left to right) are looking to develop complementary or alternative treatments that are more effective and less dangerous than Insulin therapy. (CREDIT: Université de Genève)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under healthy conditions, this is a survival mechanism. But when the body lacks insulin, as in type 1 diabetes, ketogenesis can spiral out of control. The blood turns too acidic, which leads to DKA. Each year, between 2–4% of people with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-discovery-looks-to-transform-type-1-diabetes-cancer-and-autoimmune-disease-care/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; end up in the hospital with DKA, and these emergencies can be deadly if not treated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the only reliable way to suppress excess ketones was through insulin. But insulin carries its own risks. Too much can lead to low blood sugar. Over time, it can damage fat metabolism and increase cholesterol levels. Insulin-dependent diabetics also tend to live 10 to 15 years less than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A New Player: S100A9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Roberto Coppari and his team have spent over ten years exploring how the body might survive without insulin. In 2019, they found a protein—S100A9—that could do something remarkable: it improved &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-weight-loss-and-blood-sugar-control-on-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, ketone levels, and lipid profiles in diabetic mice, all without insulin. More importantly, it didn’t trigger dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how this worked, researchers first had to uncover the exact pathway S100A9 followed. They found that the protein doesn’t enter liver cells directly. Instead, it works from the outside, activating a receptor called Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which sits on the surface of certain non-parenchymal cells in the liver. This activation leads to stimulation of a protein complex called mTORC1, which ultimately reduces ketone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway offered several key advantages. It’s independent of insulin, doesn’t cause inflammation (despite TLR4’s usual role in triggering immune responses), and may even offer anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries were detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31803-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Communications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt; study, where Giorgio Ramadori, a lead author and senior lecturer at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, helped guide the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TLR4 activation in the liver controls the production of ketones,” explained Gloria Ursino, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the study. “But this activation process does not trigger inflammation, whereas TLR4 is usually pro-inflammatory. The S100A9-TLR4 dialogue therefore seems to act as a totally unexpected anti-inflammatory drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;RIP- DTR mice were treated at day 0, 2, and 4 with DT and at day 8, were injected via tail vein with either saline (n = 5) or 0.6 mg/kg of r-hS100A9 (n = 8). Metabolic assessments were done 3 h after injection and food removal. Our model predicts that extracellular S100A9 activates non-parenchymal hepatic TLR4 signaling which consequently leads to several downstream events. (CREDIT: University of Geneva (UNIGE))&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Targeting Dangerous Ketone Spikes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When diabetic people arrive at the emergency room with severe insulin deficiency, doctors can detect a small natural rise in S100A9 levels in their blood. But this increase is not strong enough to control the &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/blood-test-accurately-predicts-dementia-140700947.html" data-ylk="slk:ketone surge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ketone surge&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where additional doses of the protein could help. The idea is to supplement this protein with a subcutaneous injection of a lab-made version—recombinant S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach has been tested in diabetic mice, and the results were promising. The protein reduced ketone levels and improved blood sugar without triggering hypoglycemia. In fact, even mice missing insulin-producing cells lived longer when treated with S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with CHF 2.5 million in funding from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, Ramadori and his team are preparing for clinical trials. This grant will help finish preclinical studies and support the application process for human testing in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like these kind of stories?

But this approach still relies on insulin, along with all its risks. S100A9 works differently. It doesn’t boost insulin or help the body respond to it. Instead, it bypasses insulin entirely, opening a new door for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been other drugs that helped insulin work better,” said Coppari. “But this just meant patients could use smaller doses. The risks didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Representative image of immunofluorescence in RAW264.7 cells expressing mCherry-TOSI treated incubated with 2μg/mL of r-mS100A9 or r-hS100A9. (CREDIT: University of Geneva (UNIGE))&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;S100A9 may reduce the body’s reliance on insulin altogether. Researchers plan to test it first in combination with low doses of insulin. However, in some cases, it could one day be used alone. That would be especially helpful for people who can’t produce insulin at all, like those who’ve had their pancreas removed or who have severe forms of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-daily-cup-of-tea-helps-reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides helping manage diabetes, the S100A9 pathway may hold benefits for other conditions involving inflammation or poor metabolism. Because it works without triggering the body’s inflammatory alarms, it might offer a safer way to manage energy balance in many diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To push this innovation forward, Coppari and Ramadori have founded &lt;a href="https://www.diatheris.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diatheris;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Diatheris&lt;/a&gt;, a startup company based in Geneva. Supported by the university’s technology transfer office, UNITEC, and FONGIT, which backs new technologies in the region, the company aims to develop S100A9 into a real-world therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;S100A9 suppresses diabetic ketogenesis via hepatic TLR4. (CREDIT: University of Geneva (UNIGE))&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ work could mark a turning point in the management of type 1 diabetes. Instead of relying on a century-old treatment with known risks, people could one day control their condition with a safer, more stable option. And with clinical trials on the horizon, that future may be closer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

In a unique study, participants took an immersive art tour and were later tested on their memory of both object features and event sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While memory for visual details faded, memory for the sequence of events significantly improved after sleep. Brain recordings confirmed that deep sleep brainwaves—slow waves and spindles—were linked to this long-lasting memory boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequence-Specific Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep enhanced memory for event order, not visual features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; A single night’s sleep improved sequential memory for up to 15 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Sleep Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Brainwaves during deep sleep were tied to stronger memory retention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baycrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While sleep’s positive impact on cognition has long been recognized, Baycrest researchers have revealed that a good night’s sleep may actively enhance memory rather than simply protect it from decline. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings are the first to reveal that sleep helps us better remember the order of events in our lives, even after more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While our memory for features such as object size and colour declines over time, sleep can improve our memory for event sequence,” says Dr. Brian Levine, Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute, part of the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education (BARE) and senior author on this study, titled “Sleep selectively and durably enhances memory for the sequence of real-world experiences” and published recently in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study deepens our understanding of how critical sleep is for integrating experiences into memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most studies on human memory for events require participants to memorize items, such as words or pictures, in a laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in this study, Dr. Levine—along with then-graduate students Dr. Nicholas B. Diamond and Dr. Stephanie Simpson—designed a unique and immersive real-world experience in a 20-minute audio-guided tour of artworks displayed at Baycrest, a global leader in aging and brain health in Toronto, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants took the tour and were tested on their memory at five delay intervals ranging from one hour to 15 months after the tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests included questions on the physical features of the artwork and the sequential order of tour items. The researchers found that sleep boosted memory for sequences, whereas memory for features declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm their findings, they ran a second study where participants were randomized to either a wake group or a sleep group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sleep group did the tour and first memory test in the evening and the second memory test after a night of sleep in a sleep laboratory with brain activity monitored with electroencephalography (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wake group did the tour and first memory test in the morning and the second memory test in the evening after normal daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the long-term effects of sleep on memory, both groups completed additional memory tests one week, one month and 15 months following the tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main study findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep improved memory for the order of the tour items (sequences), but not memory for features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The advantage of sleep versus wake for sequential memory was evident after a single night of sleep, and this advantage held at all test points, including 15 months later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No such improvement was found for memory for features of the tour items, such as shape and colour, which continued to decline over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain activity recordings in the sleep laboratory showed that specific brain waves during deep sleep – namely slow waves and spindles – were linked to overall memory enhancement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, including for the brain and cognition. This study shows how deep sleep benefits memory for the sequential structure of everyday events, even when the specific details of those events fade with time, and points to a potential cause of memory changes in older adults living with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The benefits of sleep on memory are powerful; just one night makes a difference that persists over a year,” said Dr. Levine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd93939c9e988b8e9694d0919c948f99bd9f9c849e8f988e89d3928f9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://baycrest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baycrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird – Baycrest&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02117-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep selectively and durably enhances memory for the sequence of real-world experiences&lt;/a&gt;” by Brian Levine et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep selectively and durably enhances memory for the sequence of real-world experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the retention of memory for past experiences (episodic memory), reducing the rate of forgetting compared with wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it remains unclear whether and how sleep actively transforms the way we remember multidimensional real-world experiences, and how such memory transformation unfolds over the days, months and years that follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exception to the law of forgetting, we show that sleep actively and selectively improves the accuracy of memory for a one-time, real-world experience (an art tour)—specifically boosting memory for the order of tour items (sequential associations) versus perceptual details from the tour (featural associations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This above-baseline boost in sequence memory was not evident after a matched period of wakefulness. Moreover, the preferential retention of sequence relative to featural memory observed after a night’s sleep grew over time up to 1 year post-encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, overnight polysomnography showed that sleep-related memory enhancement was associated with the duration and neurophysiological hallmarks of slow-wave sleep previously linked to sequential neural replay, particularly spindle–slow wave coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that sleep serves a crucial and selective role in enhancing sequential organization in our memory for past events at the expense of perceptual details, linking sleep-related neural mechanisms to the days-to-years-long transformation of memory for complex real-life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 21:20:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1uN1pYUzVlUGNxcmxGelRmRFlEMFRwRFFwaDJjSXhVc1Q1YVFYT25aZ0p6eUJEQjdYaFloWTZOWlpYRURjU2ZNWEsybG13RTZCQ1ctSnBucnlxMUNKRks5SXcwSVRTdzhEVnlV</guid></item><item><title>Two measles cases reported in Arkansas | What we know - thv11.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNRUZVUXlzTjkyOFptNUZMNDlNTmRIYl9pSFhDNXZhWWE4NTR5bjNheUZzbUZjNVlRS3RjcmtEN0UyYm9NZnB1bElGU05TRXI0N04tVjB6cHQ5Z245cmpFU25xMkNfRU1iLXpQVF9ERnZDeTJwczFONXhsWUIxdjBzdFNPNG9YSTdCdC1jcHVlYmhMQzF0SGN3bk9FdmExRUpoZGpleTJiSFptd2RCY1RrczJyVmpURWUwSGRJbVJqSVRqOWJrY3BkUFpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Arkansas Department of Health announced that two positive cases of measles have now been identified in Central Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SALINE COUNTY, Ark. — Officials with the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) have now announced two positive cases of measles in Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADH announced the first positive case on the afternoon of Thursday, April 10, when a positive case of measles had been identified in Saline County. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to ADH officials, the case was identified in an Arkansan who was unvaccinated against the illness. Additionally, they said that the Arkansan was exposed to the illness during a visit out of state. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this positive measles identification, the state of Arkansas hadn't seen a positive measles case since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADH said that the individual visited four different locations while infectious. Here's a look at the locations and the times that they visited each place: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baptist Health Urgent Care on Military Road in Benton on April 6 between 3:30 to 6:09 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saline Memorial Hospital Emergency Department on April 6, between 6:30 to 10:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Benton Family Clinic on April 8 between 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Children’s Emergency Department on April 8 between 11:49 a.m. to 5:59 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later, the ADH confirmed that a second positive case of pediatric measles had been confirmed in an unvaccinated Arkansas resident from Faulkner County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports say that the child who tested positive was exposed during out-of-state travel. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child reportedly visited the following locations while infectious: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Pediatrics of Conway on April 7, 2025, from 9:10 to 11:25 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arkansas Children’s Emergency Department on April 9, 2025, from 1:15 to 8:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADH officials confirmed that there have not been any reports of exposures at daycares or schools. They also encouraged people who visited any of the listed locations to visit a health care professional and receive an MMR vaccine to prevent the spread of the illness. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No exposures have been identified at daycares or schools. Anyone at any of the identified locations during those dates and times is urged to get up-to-date on the MMR vaccine as quickly as possible," ADH said in a press release. "If the MMR vaccine is given soon after exposure, it can stop the infection from developing. If someone is unable to receive the MMR vaccine, they should discuss options with their health care provider. The ADH and affected facilities will be contacting potentially exposed individuals." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who may have been potentially exposed, here are the symptoms that ADH officials said that you should look out for: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conjunctivitis &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, health experts encourage anyone who has visited any of the locations listed above to monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the news of a positive case of measles in the state, the Arkansas Children's Hospital released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Arkansas Department of Health notified Arkansas Children’s that a patient who visited Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s emergency room in Little Rock tested positive for measles," said the hospital. "Arkansas Children's encourages families to ensure they are up-to-date on their measles immunizations and to reach out to their primary care physician, pediatrician, pharmacy, or county health unit to schedule a measles vaccine, known as the MMR.” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel as though you've been potentially exposed to measles, you can contact ADH at 1-866-940-7568.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

IT’S THE FIRST CASE REPORTED IN ARKANSAS SINCE 2018. AND THIS COMES AS AN OUTBREAK GROWS NATIONWIDE. NOW, THE DIRECTOR SAYS THE INFECTED CHILD TRAVELED OUT OF STATE. THEY’RE DOING CONTACT TRACING TO SEE WHO THEY MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WHEN THEY RETURNED. NOW, IN THE MEANTIME, THEY’RE ENCOURAGING ANYONE NOT VACCINATED TO DO SO. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WITH TWO DOSES OF THE VACCINE, THEN. ABOUT 97% OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE PROTECTED FROM ACTUALLY GETTING THE MEASLES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NOW, SHE SAYS, THIS VACCINE IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS, AND THAT’S IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF HOW EASILY MEASLES CAN SPREAD. SHE SAYS IF A PERSON WITH MEASLES ENTERS A ROOM, NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN VACCINATED WILL CATCH THE DISEASE. NOW WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS DEVELOPING STORY AND BRING YOU THE LATEST UPDAT

The case involves an unvaccinated child from Saline County who contracted the virus during out-of-state travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe health complications. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and rash. The virus is infectious for four days before and after the rash appears. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine offers long-lasting protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected individual visited several locations while contagious, including Baptist Health Urgent Care in Benton on April 6 from 3:30 to 6:09 p.m., Saline Memorial Hospital Emergency Department on April 6 from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m., Benton Family Clinic on April 8 from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., and Arkansas Children Hospital's (ACH) Emergency Department on April 8 from 11:49 a.m. to 5:59 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No exposures have been identified at daycares or schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADH urges anyone who was at these locations during the specified times to ensure they are up to date on the MMR vaccine. Receiving the vaccine soon after exposure can prevent the infection from developing. Those unable to receive the vaccine should consult their healthcare provider for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADH and affected facilities are reaching out to potentially exposed individuals. People who were at the listed locations during the specified times should monitor for symptoms for 21 days post-exposure. If symptoms develop, individuals should contact their healthcare provider by phone, mention potential measles exposure, and have the provider contact ADH at 1-866-940-7568.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas Children’s has also set up a call line for families. If you believe you have been exposed during your visit, you can call the hospital at 501-364-8367.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arkansas Children's encourages families to ensure they are up-to-date on their measles immunizations and to reach out to their primary care physician, pediatrician, pharmacy or county health unit to schedule a measles vaccine, known as the MMR," said Karen Farst, MD, Senior Vice President &amp;amp; Chief Medical Officer at ACH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have received the MMR vaccine or were born before 1957 are generally considered immune. For more information, visit the Arkansas Department of Health's website or call 1-866-940-7568 between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATV</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 20:35:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQOWlsLTNSeDBqdjdQZzJCa2VpV1p2Z3JtOFhkWTdUTWZvNTRjQS10bmk4NHpvUFRVNmRiMVpGQ0tKbko5VDZQaDVmTzRxTS1hNTdoQ2pfTUFfTGRCS2NPYkN4b2NaXy0yZHREanVES2lsWUJmNnhMWmpOQzBISjg0NzhkOG9oWERhcDdv</guid></item><item><title>Purkinje Cells Control Tongue Precision in Skilled Movements - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1BR0FvSUVMVXVTY1ZOV2tPMXRMeWJ2c240YzY4dGswYmhxTXpGZnFqRE9idjVGYjZwWGFsWl90M0FXcHhNU29OQnNsWVdBVG5uemhTWTF1MElLZnc2dDBVTjliXzFYQ1VNclh3X0R6alNkbTlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers studying marmosets discovered that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum help regulate tongue movement by signaling when to stop as the tongue nears its target. These cells were highly engaged during precision tasks, like inserting the tongue into narrow tubes, but not during casual grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers suppressed these cells, the tongue overshot its target or slowed in retraction, revealing how crucial Purkinje cell activity is to coordination. The findings shed light on how the cerebellum contributes to precise motor control and could inform treatments for speech and swallowing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Precision:&lt;/strong&gt; Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermis signal to stop tongue movement near targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Suppressing these cells caused overreach or slowed tongue return.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may aid therapies for speech, swallowing, and vocal disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By studying the skilled movements of marmoset tongues, researchers have discovered that Purkinje cells (P-cells) in a brain region called the cerebellum signal to stop protrusion as the tongue approaches its target, according to a study published April 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Reza Shadmehr from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, U.S., and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use our tongue to shape the air and generate sounds to communicate, and we use our tongue to evaluate food morsels and transport them through the oral cavity when eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108595"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sticking out their tongue and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tongue-movement-purkinje-cells-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results suggest that P-cells signal to downstream structures to stop the movement as the tongue approaches its target. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These skillful acts involve coordination of more than 100 muscles, producing movements that are fundamental to our existence. Damage to the cerebellum disrupts these movements, resulting in abnormal muscle activation patterns. Yet it has not been clear how the cerebellum controls tongue movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, Shadmehr and colleagues used an animal model that has a long tongue and can skillfully direct it to small targets. Marmosets have a 21mm tongue which they use to burrow into small holes and retrieve insects and sap. Indeed, they have an extraordinary ability to control their tongue, vocalizing to label other marmosets during two-way communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that marmosets could naturally bend and twist their tongues and insert them into small tubes, even when the tubes were placed at sharp angles with respect to their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify how the cerebellum contributes to the control of the tongue, the researchers recorded the activity of P-cells in a cerebellar structure called the vermis. When a P-cell was suppressed during protraction, the tongue’s trajectory became hypermetric, overshooting the intended target during movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue’s return to the mouth was slowed. Both effects were amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Suppression of P-cells in the vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that P-cells signal to downstream structures to stop the movement as the tongue approaches its target. This strong engagement of the P-cells was present when the tongue was aiming for a small tube – a movement that requires precision — but not when the tongue was used to groom the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, treatments or cures for symptoms linked to cerebellar dysfunction, such as vocal muscle spasms, problems with swallowing, or speech disorders, will require a much better understanding of how the cerebellum contributes to the control and learning of tongue movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because marmosets are exceptionally skilled at shaping and twisting their tongues, using them almost like fingers, they are an attractive animal model to study the neural control of a body part that is essential for our existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “During dexterous licking, a climbing fiber induced suppression of Purkinje cells in the lingual vermis inhibited the forces that would otherwise retract the tongue, resulting in hypermetria during protraction and slowing during retraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because the direction of these forces aligned with the direction of motion specified by the olivary input, a pattern that is also present for P-cells in the oculomotor region of the cerebellum, the results imply a general computation for P-cells during control of targeted movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) (R01-EB028156 to RS, R37-NS128416 to RS) and the National Science Foundation (&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/&lt;/a&gt;) (CNS-1714623 to RS).

For example, we use our hands to sense properties of objects and transport them in the nearby space, and we use our tongue to sense properties of food morsels and transport them through the oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does the cerebellum contribute to control of tongue movements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we trained head-fixed marmosets to make skillful tongue movements to harvest food from small tubes that were placed at sharp angles to their mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified the lingual regions of the cerebellar vermis and then measured the contribution of each Purkinje cell (P-cell) to control of the tongue by relying on the brief but complete suppression that they experienced following an input from the inferior olive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a P-cell was suppressed during protraction, the tongue’s trajectory became hypermetric, and when the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue’s return to the mouth was slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both effects were amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Moreover, these effects were present even when the pauses were not due to the climbing fiber input. Therefore, suppression of P-cells in the lingual vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the population simple spike activity peaked near deceleration onset when the movement required precision (aiming for a tube), but not when the movement was for the purpose of grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the P-cells appeared to signal when to stop protrusion as the tongue approached its target.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 20:35:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1BR0FvSUVMVXVTY1ZOV2tPMXRMeWJ2c240YzY4dGswYmhxTXpGZnFqRE9idjVGYjZwWGFsWl90M0FXcHhNU29OQnNsWVdBVG5uemhTWTF1MElLZnc2dDBVTjliXzFYQ1VNclh3X0R6alNkbTlM</guid></item><item><title>Brain Circuit Discovery Links Cancer Fatigue to Inflammation - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Mb3V6NnZnd284NXhJN2wybWR1U1NWNXQxcFdiU3BCaVJXMHJqRHZiOHlJYm04d2ZPUXRUOFphUmhrVHdKaXJ3WmxRWUxseEQ0Skx5RHJ1MHhqSFVldk5OMThNeXJNajlfZkxOem5QaGg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that apathy and fatigue in advanced cancer are driven not by physical decline, but by inflammation-sensing neurons that suppress motivation. Scientists discovered that inflammation triggers a brainstem-to-reward-center pathway that reduces dopamine, the brain’s key motivation chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking this pathway in mice restored their drive to act, even in late-stage cancer, despite ongoing weight loss and disease progression. The findings point to a potential new way to improve quality of life in patients by targeting brain inflammation directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Brain Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Inflammation-sensing neurons in the brainstem suppress dopamine release, reducing motivation in cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking these neurons or using an IL-6 antibody restored motivation in mice with advanced cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The same pathway may underlie apathy across other chronic inflammatory illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fatigue and lack of motivation that many cancer patients experience near the end of life have been seen as the unavoidable consequences of their declining physical health and extreme weight loss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis challenges that long-held assumption, showing instead that these behavioral changes stem from specific inflammation-sensing neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108591"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Cancer-fatigue-inflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Treating the mice with an IL-6 antibody similar to an existing FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition, also restored the animal’s motivation, a finding that points to a potential treatment for the psychological symptoms associated with advanced cancer. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published April 11 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers report that they identified a direct connection between cancer-related inflammation and the loss of motivation characteristic of advanced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying mice with cancer-linked cachexia, a condition typical of the disease that leads to muscle wasting and weight loss, they discovered a previously unrecognized pathway in the brain. This pathway senses inflammation and actively suppresses dopamine — a key driver of motivation — resulting in apathy and loss of drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the pathway restored motivation, even though the cancer and weight loss continued. This indicates that apathy can be treated separately from the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of the research are profound,” said the study’s lead author, Adam Kepecs, PhD, professor of neuroscience and of psychiatry at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve uncovered a direct brain mechanism through which inflammation drives apathy in cancer, and we were able to restore normal motivation in mice with cachexia, despite ongoing inflammation as cancer progressed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 70% of patients with advanced cancer experience cachexia. In addition to physical decline, patients often suffer from severe fatigue, apathy and a lack of motivation that affect their overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand whether these psychological symptoms are side effects that emerge from physical deterioration or whether they arise from distinct biological mechanisms, the research team, including Marco Pignatelli, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at WashU Medicine, and Tobias Janowitz, MD, PhD, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, turned to a well-validated mouse model of cancer cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused specifically on behavioral symptoms, which had not previously been investigated, and mapped the brain regions involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that a structure in the brainstem, a part of the brain that controls vital functions such as breathing and heart rate, acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals in the bloodstream, particularly a molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is elevated in cancer cachexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When IL-6 levels rise, neurons in this region of the brainstem transmit a signal through a defined pathway that suppresses dopamine release in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, which is key for motivation and reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting drop in dopamine had the effect of making the mice less motivated to exert themselves to complete activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if interfering with this response could treat the lack of motivation and apathy, Kepecs and his colleagues tried two different approaches: they boosted dopamine levels and blocked inflammation-sensing neurons in the brainstem. Both approaches eliminated or reduced apathy in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating the mice with an IL-6 antibody similar to an existing FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition, also restored the animal’s motivation, a finding that points to a potential treatment for the psychological symptoms associated with advanced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is that motivation was restored even in late-stage disease,” said Pignatelli. “It suggests we may be able to improve quality of life by targeting the brain circuit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For acute illnesses such as infections, this inflammation-driven reduction in motivation may be adaptive, helping the body conserve energy to fight off disease, Kepecs explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic conditions such as cachexia, prolonged apathy — including a reduced drive to eat, move or engage socially – can become harmful, worsening health and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because IL-6 — the inflammatory molecule driving this effect — is elevated in many other conditions, and the brain regions involved are central to motivation, this same circuit likely contributes to apathy across a range of chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gives us a new way to understand apathy in advanced cancer,” said Kepecs. “It’s not just a byproduct of physical decline, but a direct response to inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means we can potentially target the underlying biology to improve motivation and quality of life — even when the cancer itself is no longer treatable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant P50 HD103525, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft grant DFG -STA 1544, LaCaixa, the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research grant 20-028-EDV, the Simons Foundation, Cancer Grand Challenges, NIH grant 1OT2CA278690-01, CRUK: CGCATF-2021/ 100019, and NIH/National Cancer Institute grant R37CA286477-01A1, Cancer Center Support grant 5P30CA045508, NIMH grant MH130610, the Taylor Family Institute for Innovative Psychiatric Research, the Hope Center Pilot Grant, the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience Small Grant, and the NARSAD Young Investigator Grant 27102 and P&amp;amp;S Fund, a WUSTL BJC investigator award and NIH grant DP1 MH14002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Cancer and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#412b6f22293433222901363432352d6f242534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jessica Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jessica Church – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adm8857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neuroimmune circuit mediates cancer cachexia-associated apathy&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Kepecs et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neuroimmune circuit mediates cancer cachexia-associated apathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cachexia is a debilitating wasting syndrome that affects most advanced cancer patients, characterized by profound involuntary weight loss, muscle and fat depletion, and disrupted energy balance. Beyond physical decline, patients commonly experience severe fatigue, apathy, and depression that further diminish their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these pervasive neuropsychiatric symptoms, the biological mechanisms linking peripheral wasting to brain dysfunction and behavioral changes remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systemic inflammation, marked by elevated circulating cytokines, is a key driver of cancer cachexia. Although inflammation could broadly compromise neuronal function, we hypothesized that it acts through specialized circuits that conserve energy during acute illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cancer, persistent activation of these circuits may drive chronic fatigue and depression, providing a mechanistic framework for how inflammation dynamically regulates motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate cachexia’s impact on motivation, we used an established preclinical model: mice subcutaneously implanted with colon adenocarcinoma cells (C26). Within weeks, the mice exhibited classical cachexia symptoms—weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased feeding—accompanied by pronounced motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A battery of behavioral assays uncovered specific deficits in effort-sensitive tasks such as patch foraging and progressive ratio tests. By contrast, tests of physical activity (open-field exploration), reward sensitivity (sucrose preference, a measure of anhedonia), and despair (tail suspension, forced swim tests) remained unchanged, although home-cage activity was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This identifies a specific reduction in effort-based motivation, indicative of apathy and distinct from general weakness or anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive cytokine screen showed rising interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the blood and brain that paralleled cachexia progression. Whole-brain, cellular-resolution activity mapping and viral tracing uncovered a circuit originating in the area postrema, a circumventricular organ specialized for detecting blood-borne signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IL-6–sensing neurons in this region project to the parabrachial nucleus, which in turn activates the substantia nigra pars reticulata inhibitory neurons, ultimately suppressing dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Optogenetic stimulation of area postrema neurons rapidly suppressed accumbens dopamine release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal dopamine monitoring during cachexia progression revealed a progressive decline in accumbens dopamine that tracked with worsening motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting this IL-6–sensing pathway reversed cachexia-induced apathy. Blocking IL-6 with systemic antibodies, knocking down (genetic reduction of gene expression) IL-6 receptors in the area postrema, or ablating area postrema–to–parabrachial neurons each alleviated the motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, boosting dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens—through optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons or local dopamine agonist infusion—restored motivation despite ongoing inflammation, even at late stages of cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified an immune-to-neural circuit through which inflammation drives motivational deficits in cancer cachexia. Area postrema neurons detect circulating IL-6 and relay this signal to the basal ganglia to suppress mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This specialized interoceptive pathway demonstrates that inflammation engages discrete neural circuits rather than causing broad disruption and cumulative neural damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this circuit is likely adaptive during acute illness—conserving energy by dampening motivation—its persistent engagement in chronic conditions such as cancer cachexia is detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reveals that psychiatric symptoms such as apathy in cachexia are not secondary effects of physical decline but can arise directly from the same pathological mechanisms driving the illness itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting this circuit through ablation of IL-6 sensing or boosting dopamine release relieved motivational deficits, opening therapeutic avenues for neuropsychiatric symptoms in cachexia and possibly other inflammatory conditions where IL-6 is elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by quantifying effort sensitivity as a dimension of motivation that is measurable across species establishes that inflammation specifically drives apathy-like behavior, enabling clinical translation and treatments for inflammation-driven motivational deficits common to conditions ranging from cancer to depression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 20:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Mb3V6NnZnd284NXhJN2wybWR1U1NWNXQxcFdiU3BCaVJXMHJqRHZiOHlJYm04d2ZPUXRUOFphUmhrVHdKaXJ3WmxRWUxseEQ0Skx5RHJ1MHhqSFVldk5OMThNeXJNajlfZkxOem5QaGg</guid></item><item><title>Probiotics linked to reduced negative feelings, offering potential mental health benefits - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOeS1qSUwtcGpkWWo3YjFGNlgxNHRvOUtsckRkajF3TERmY21CcmlkSVdNMW9IM1hEeHhQMGc5c2MyVDhSUzlneDZtT1lNeVoyTDFhcTc4dTFOay1WYmwyVFp4WXN6dmNXcVBMdmp5eF9QcWcxVkNMVUtPc21VSXN4VjhmZVRDUGJMMXNxX1RhN24?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by Katerina Johnson and Laura Steenbergen &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-025-00123-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;npj Mental Health Research&lt;/i&gt; shows that taking probiotics can help reduce negative feelings. They also investigated which people benefit most from these "good" bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Probiotics are "good" bacteria in the form of drinks or tablets that you can buy in the supermarket and are also found in foods like yogurts, fermented cheese and sauerkraut. There is growing interest in the possibility that probiotics improve not only gut health but also mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gut–brain connection provides various routes through which bacteria in the gut can influence how we feel and behave, including via the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vagus+nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; and hormones," says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daily mood reports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While animal studies have previously found promising effects of probiotics on the brain and behavior, human studies have yielded inconsistent results. Johnson and Steenbergen therefore used a combination of methods to capture how probiotics might influence the ability to regulate our emotions and affect our moods. These included psychological questionnaires, daily &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; reports and computer tasks testing how people process emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in young, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; who took a probiotic (containing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) daily for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to use daily mood reports to assess the effects of probiotics. It clearly shows that probiotics can reduce negative feelings compared to a placebo. This could mean a reduction in feelings such as anxiety, stress, fatigue or depressive tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is striking that by simply asking participants how they were feeling each day, we could detect the beneficial effects of probiotics on mood," says Steenbergen. "In contrast, the standard psychological questionnaires that are common in this field were not sensitive enough to pick up these changes."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;No substitute for antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that it took about two weeks for the probiotics to improve negative feelings. It takes about the same amount of time for antidepressants to work, but whereas antidepressants tend to reduce both negative and positive mood, the results showed that the probiotics only reduced negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a possible benefit, although the researchers stress that probiotics should not be considered a substitute for antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who would benefit most from probiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers observed the decrease in negative feelings, they were keen to explore whether they could predict who would benefit most from probiotics. "We found that various traits, most notably a propensity for risk avoidance, were associated with a greater effect of probiotics on mood," says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers found evidence that probiotics may affect the way participants process emotional cues. The participants who received probiotics were slightly more accurate at recognizing facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Probiotics could be used in a targeted way in the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many questions remain unanswered about how exactly probiotics work and their long-term effects. "Perhaps in the future &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/probiotics/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could be used in a targeted way as an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+intervention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the chances of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+feelings/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative feelings&lt;/a&gt; progressing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; such as depression, though more research would be needed to confirm that," says Steenbergen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Steenbergen hope their findings will also spur other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; researchers to include simple daily measures of mood in their studies. As they conclude in their paper, "In an attempt to delineate the complexity of the human brain and emotion, we cannot lose sight of asking the obvious. Sometimes the most simple questions reveal the most meaningful answers."&lt;/p&gt;

At the center of their discovery is a protein called S100A9, which has been shown to reduce dangerous levels of ketones in the blood—without relying on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with type 1 diabetes or those with severe insulin deficiency, life depends on daily injections of insulin. While insulin therapy has saved millions of lives, it’s far from perfect. It’s difficult to dose, can cause serious side effects, and often leads to complications like hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening condition. Researchers at the University of Geneva are now working on a treatment that could support or even replace insulin in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_the_body_s_ketone_system"&gt;Understanding the Body’s Ketone System&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, your body creates &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-boost-brain-function-and-guard-against-diabetes-alzheimers/"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt; as a backup energy source during long periods without food. This process—called ketogenesis—happens in liver cells called hepatocytes. It turns fat into ketone bodies like acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate. These molecules travel through the blood and help fuel other tissues in the body, including the brain and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Roberto Coppari, Gloria Ursino and Giorgio Ramadori (from left to right) are looking to develop complementary or alternative treatments that are more effective and less dangerous than Insulin therapy.

But when the body lacks insulin, as in type 1 diabetes, ketogenesis can spiral out of control. The blood turns too acidic, which leads to DKA. Each year, between 2–4% of people with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-discovery-looks-to-transform-type-1-diabetes-cancer-and-autoimmune-disease-care/"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; end up in the hospital with DKA, and these emergencies can be deadly if not treated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the only reliable way to suppress excess ketones was through insulin. But insulin carries its own risks. Too much can lead to low blood sugar. Over time, it can damage fat metabolism and increase cholesterol levels. Insulin-dependent diabetics also tend to live 10 to 15 years less than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_player_s100a9"&gt;A New Player: S100A9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Roberto Coppari and his team have spent over ten years exploring how the body might survive without insulin. In 2019, they found a protein—S100A9—that could do something remarkable: it improved &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-weight-loss-and-blood-sugar-control-on-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, ketone levels, and lipid profiles in diabetic mice, all without insulin. More importantly, it didn’t trigger dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how this worked, researchers first had to uncover the exact pathway S100A9 followed. They found that the protein doesn’t enter liver cells directly. Instead, it works from the outside, activating a receptor called Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which sits on the surface of certain non-parenchymal cells in the liver. This activation leads to stimulation of a protein complex called mTORC1, which ultimately reduces ketone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway offered several key advantages. It’s independent of insulin, doesn’t cause inflammation (despite TLR4’s usual role in triggering immune responses), and may even offer anti-inflammatory benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries were detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31803-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt; study, where Giorgio Ramadori, a lead author and senior lecturer at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, helped guide the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TLR4 activation in the liver controls the production of ketones,” explained Gloria Ursino, a postdoctoral fellow and first author of the study. “But this activation process does not trigger inflammation, whereas TLR4 is usually pro-inflammatory. The S100A9-TLR4 dialogue therefore seems to act as a totally unexpected anti-inflammatory drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;RIP- DTR mice were treated at day 0, 2, and 4 with DT and at day 8, were injected via tail vein with either saline (n = 5) or 0.6 mg/kg of r-hS100A9 (n = 8). Metabolic assessments were done 3 h after injection and food removal. Our model predicts that extracellular S100A9 activates non-parenchymal hepatic TLR4 signaling which consequently leads to several downstream events.

But this increase is not strong enough to control the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-dementia-risk-a-decade-early/"&gt;ketone surge&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where additional doses of the protein could help. The idea is to supplement this protein with a subcutaneous injection of a lab-made version—recombinant S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach has been tested in diabetic mice, and the results were promising. The protein reduced ketone levels and improved blood sugar without triggering hypoglycemia. In fact, even mice missing insulin-producing cells lived longer when treated with S100A9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with CHF 2.5 million in funding from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, Ramadori and his team are preparing for clinical trials. This grant will help finish preclinical studies and support the application process for human testing in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Helmsley Charitable Trust is not only accelerating the progress of our project, but also broadening its scope and impact,” said Ramadori. “Beyond the financial support, it reflects a shared commitment to advancing medical knowledge and, more importantly, improving the lives of people affected by type 1 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rethinking_insulin_therapy"&gt;Rethinking Insulin Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current diabetes research has mainly focused on improving &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-2-cups-of-mangos-daily-could-help-prevent-diabetes-study-finds/"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;—how the body responds to the hormone. But this approach still relies on insulin, along with all its risks. S100A9 works differently. It doesn’t boost insulin or help the body respond to it. Instead, it bypasses insulin entirely, opening a new door for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been other drugs that helped insulin work better,” said Coppari. “But this just meant patients could use smaller doses. The risks didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Representative image of immunofluorescence in RAW264.7 cells expressing mCherry-TOSI treated incubated with 2μg/mL of r-mS100A9 or r-hS100A9.

Researchers plan to test it first in combination with low doses of insulin. However, in some cases, it could one day be used alone. That would be especially helpful for people who can’t produce insulin at all, like those who’ve had their pancreas removed or who have severe forms of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-daily-cup-of-tea-helps-reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_bigger_picture"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides helping manage diabetes, the S100A9 pathway may hold benefits for other conditions involving inflammation or poor metabolism. Because it works without triggering the body’s inflammatory alarms, it might offer a safer way to manage energy balance in many diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To push this innovation forward, Coppari and Ramadori have founded &lt;a href="https://www.diatheris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Diatheris&lt;/a&gt;, a startup company based in Geneva. Supported by the university’s technology transfer office, UNITEC, and FONGIT, which backs new technologies in the region, the company aims to develop S100A9 into a real-world therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;S100A9 suppresses diabetic ketogenesis via hepatic TLR4.

Nygren told ABC News he held out hope that Kennedy, made aware of its importance to Navajo Nation, might consider reinstating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;From the start of the layoffs, Kennedy has insisted that no “essential services” would be cut. “The cuts in all of our agency are not affecting science,” Kennedy told ABC News last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But the scope of the cuts — and the work impacted, from utility bill assistance on Navajo Nation, to research into black lung disease for coal miners, to a division that monitors lead exposure among children — has continued to dog Kennedy, raising questions about his oversight and involvement in the major restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In all, the tribal leaders were resoundingly appreciative of Kennedy's visit, which was part of his first major trip as HHS secretary.

While there, he toured the Osher Center for Integrative Health at the University of Utah, which is aiming to center healthy diet and exercise in the health care conversation, and got aboard their “food pharmacy,” which delivers prescribed healthy foods to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Arizona, which passed a law to ban SNAP recipients from using the assistance for soda, Kennedy held a press conference with the legislators who championed the bill and toured a Phoenix health center that offers healthy cooking programs for local native communities. He also stopped in for a panel discussion at the 2025 Tribal Self-Governance Conference, sitting with tribal leaders including the chairwoman of the Wampanoag Tribe, which he fondly described spending time around during his childhood in Massachussetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;On Navajo Nation, the crowd that gathered at the foot of Window Rock, a memorial, commended him for his devoted attention to issues of outdated medical centers, lack of water infrastructure and inadequate access to healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Processed food hurts all of us. It disproportionately injures Native people,” Kennedy told the group of Navajo leaders, who nodded in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But they also used the opportunity to tell Kennedy that they needed more support, not less — warning against the impact of his agency’s cuts.

Though they &lt;a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/benzodiazepine/symptoms-and-signs"&gt;are addictive&lt;/a&gt;, they’re pretty good at chilling us out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it turns out that by drugging ourselves with these pills, we are inadvertently drugging wild animals as well. Especially the ones that live in water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our bodies don’t absorb 100 percent of the drugs we ingest, so traces of them end up in the toilet. And because sewage treatment plants usually &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/household-medication-disposal/how-pharmaceuticals-enter-environment#:~:text=Wastewater%20Treatment%20Plants,-Wastewater%20from%20households&amp;amp;text=While%20POTWs%20may%20remove%20some,not%20designed%20to%20remove%20pharmaceuticals."&gt;can’t filter them all out&lt;/a&gt;, those compounds ultimately end up where treated sewage is released — in rivers, lakes, and coastal habitats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This means that fish and other aquatic critters that live in these environments are, for better or worse, exposed to our meds. Basically fish are on drugs — our drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What, exactly, does that mean for wildlife? That’s what a relatively new field of research is trying to figure out. And a &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp7174"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; just published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; offers some compelling clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The authors gave young Atlantic salmon in Sweden a dose of clobazam — a benzo used to treat seizures and anxiety that’s often found in wastewater — equal to what some fish might naturally be exposed to in streams. Then they monitored what the drug did to the fish as they migrated, as young salmon do, from a river out to the Baltic Sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Dalälven, the river in Sweden where the study took place.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michael Bertram&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Marcus Michelangeli, a study co-author.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michael Bertram&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Remarkably, the study found that more of the salmon on benzos made it out to sea than those that were drug-free, perhaps because they were more likely to survive the journey. The clobazam fish also passed through obstacles along the way — two hydropower dams — at a faster clip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These results highlight a strange irony: Humans have made the world more stressful for all kinds of animals by, for example, &lt;a href="/down-to-earth/23904829/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-tipping-point"&gt;destroying their habitat&lt;/a&gt; and damming up rivers. At the same time, we’re flooding the environment with mood-changing meds. Is that somehow helping them cope? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pretty much &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2113947119#sec-1"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt; scientists look for drugs in the water, they find them. Caffeine. Metformin. Antidepressants. Antibiotics. Birth control. Tylenol. Basically, if we use a lot of them, they’re part of aquatic habitats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Thankfully, they appear in low enough doses that if you, say, chug a glass of river water those chemicals are not likely to affect you (again, for better or worse). Most fish, however, are much smaller. And previous research shows that these micro-doses can influence them in serious ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A seminal 2007 &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0609568104"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, showed that small amounts of synthetic estrogen — a common ingredient in birth control that often makes its way into the environment — can “feminize” male minnows. This means they can produce early-stage eggs in their testes, essentially becoming intersex. That ultimately impairs their ability to mate and can, as the study showed, cause fish populations to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A fathead minnow.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;TroutFodder/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10408444.2012.692114"&gt;also shown&lt;/a&gt; that male fish exposed to estrogen struggle to build nests and put on courtship displays for females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Trace levels of antidepressants, like fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) affect fish behavior, too — sometimes in bizarre ways. I came across &lt;a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.14152"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; linking fluoxetine exposure to larger “gonopodium” size. That’s basically a fish penis. The drug can also “increase male coercive mating behavior,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6072683/#S14"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on sertraline, meanwhile, suggests the drug can make fish less anxious and more likely to take risks and explore. Some &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1226850"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the benzo oxazepam has similarly been shown to make fish bolder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Oh, and I also found some interesting experiments with metformin, which is used to treat Type 2 diabetes and thus one of the most widespread drugs in wastewater. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5953473/"&gt;2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; suggests that when Siamese fighting fish — like the betta fish you can buy at pet stores — are exposed to levels of metformin that have been found in the environment, they become less aggressive. Fighting fish, fighting less! “Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last two decades scientists have turned up plenty of evidence that drugs in our wastewater alter the lives and behavior of fish (and &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.1297"&gt;some other animals&lt;/a&gt;). The problem is that most of these studies are done in labs, in fish tanks, and not in the wild. So they don’t tell us much about what this means for animals in the real world, many of which are threatened with extinction, including some populations of Atlantic salmon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s what makes this new study so useful — and frankly, impressive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="more-drugged-salmon-make-it-out-to-sea" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;More drugged salmon make it out to sea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Atlantic salmon, if I may say, live remarkable lives. They’re born in freshwater streams and then, as young, go through a number of &lt;a href="https://www.uib.no/en/rg/mdb/57157/smoltificationosmoregulation"&gt;physical transformations&lt;/a&gt; before migrating to the salty ocean in a process that can cover thousands of miles. After living their lives at sea for a year or more, they’ll swim back up river — typically in the same river they were born in, relying on some &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-salmon-know-where-their-home-when-they-return-ocean#:~:text=Scientists%20believe%20that%20salmon%20navigate,the%20ocean%20as%20young%20fish."&gt;magical-sounding&lt;/a&gt; navigation skills — to have babies and produce the next salmon generation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even in historic times, this life was probably stressful. All that travel. Swimming through rivers full of predators. Yikes! Humans have only made it harder. We’ve installed dams that fish have to navigate; there are more than 7,600 dams in Sweden alone. We’ve heated up the ocean and streams, which can &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/salmon-climate-change-1.6114328"&gt;deprive salmon of oxygen&lt;/a&gt;. We fish the hell out of them. And of course, we’ve polluted their habitat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Key, here, is that some of that pollution consists of drugs specifically designed to make humans less anxious. Authors of the new study wanted to figure out whether they might have a related effect on fish — and, importantly, what that means for their arduous journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The researchers’ methods were somewhat bizarre: They collected dozens of young wild salmon from a hatchery along the Dalälven, a river in Sweden, and inserted medical implants into their flesh. Some of those implants slowly released drugs — including the benzo clobazam — at a level akin to what they might be exposed to in the wild. (The researchers didn’t detect clobazam in this particular river.) Other implants were essentially placebos, meaning they didn’t release anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The team also performed surgeries on the fish to insert miniature devices that emit sound; those sounds can be picked up by underwater microphones that were placed along the river to track each individual fish. (How do you do surgery on a fish? You sedate it and run water over their gills while you’re operating.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then they released the fish back into the river — which has two hydropower dams downstream — and tracked their journey to sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A dam in Dalälven River.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Rebecca Forsberg&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As they discovered, the fish drugged with clobazam were &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to make it to sea compared to those that were drug-free. It’s likely that more of the undrugged salmon died on their journey or were otherwise slowed down, said Jack Brand, the study’s lead author and a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This might be because the benzos made the fish less social — less likely to school in the face of predators — and more likely to take risks, he said. Those traits can be helpful for navigating downstream. Solitary fish tend to move faster, Brand told me. And with benzos in their system, they may be less afraid to swim through a dam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“These drugs can be used in humans as anti-stress drugs,” Brand said. “You can imagine passing through a hydropower dam — these are big dams with big turbines — is a fairly stressful event for a small fish. And usually what you find is that lots of predators hang around these areas. Maybe it’s helping the fish recover from stress faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Outside experts I talked to mostly agree with his interpretation — that the clobazam likely made the fish less risk-averse. “It probably was because they were more bold than the other fish, which were kind of shy and hanging together,” said James Meador, an affiliate professor at the University of Washington who has spent years studying how pollutants affect fish. He was not involved with the research. “Even in the presence of predators, I guess they really weren’t too concerned.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is pretty wild to think about. When these fish encounter stressful situations, trace levels of human anti-anxiety medications — which are, to be clear, pollution — may be sort of chilling them out. So, drugs: good? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="are-drugged-salmon-better-off" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Are drugged salmon better off? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At face value, it seems like a little dose of clobazam can help these fish out with their stressful lives, not unlike it may do for some of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, as I was told, that is very clearly the wrong takeaway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Salmon leap out of the water in the Ettrick, a river in Scotland.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We think that any changes to natural behavior are likely to have potential negative consequences,” Brand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Fish on clobazam are less likely to school, or group together, which is an anti-predator response. So even though they appear better at navigating the river — and less likely to be eaten during their seaward migration — it’s possible that they may be more prone to getting killed at sea. We just don’t know. (Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969719325483"&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt; shows that young salmon exposed to a much higher dose of a different benzo — oxazepam — were more likely to be eaten by predators during their downstream migration.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The definition of pollution is that it causes harm,” said Karen Kidd, an ecotoxicologist at McMaster University in Canada who was not involved in the new &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; study. “There are still many unknowns, such as whether it influences their survival in the ocean or their ability to return to spawn in the river as adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, while it’s not clear exactly how clobazam is shaping salmon populations, it is influencing the complex behavior of a species — and its relationships in a food web balanced by millennia. That alone is cause for concern: It’s another way we’re messing with nature. And clobazam is just one of the thousands of prescription drugs worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That leads me to the last point: We’re pumping out &lt;a href="https://efpia.eu/media/2rxdkn43/the-pharmaceutical-industry-in-figures-2024.pdf"&gt;more and more&lt;/a&gt; chemicals every year and scientists still don’t understand how most of them — there are &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/policy/chemical-regulation/Number-chemicals-commerce-vastly-underestimated/98/i7"&gt;tens if not hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt; — affect the natural world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If society values clean water, then we need to understand the consequences of chemicals that we put in the natural world,” said Bryan Brooks, an environmental scientist at Baylor University, who was not involved with the new research. The bottom line, he added, is that “if we put stuff in the environment, we need to understand what happens to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Today roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08375-z"&gt;a quarter of freshwater wildlife&lt;/a&gt; is in decline and at risk of extinction. Most of the threats they face are visible — dams, the destruction of habitat, invasive species. Our drugs are almost certainly another serious threat, though it’s one we can’t see and poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Pharmaceutical pollution, or chemical pollution in general, is really this invisible agent of global change,” Brand said. “It’s probably posing a greater risk than at least what the public acknowledges. This is a potentially significant threat to our aquatic wildlife.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNWnhtZVVjcUc5VWRUUVRXYnB3M2hvbDhSaHdLZEtSb3B3UUQyQTJKZzg3VUExVUpsbFAyN3VHb0ZFY3JIT290LXQwRmtraFlIRGhVSHctTURXRGp4VUpJam5Rbkxaa2VmYy02bWFERDlYZmJHU2xMNTJaSVVCMWppTHg3NHZpSWRZZWpHTUVuMEczZU1sdlE</guid></item><item><title>Doctors Warn "Flesh-Eating" Strep Throat Infections Have "Substantially Increased"—How to Stay Safe - bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE96VzA0VW1DMkFmYlpMWU91X2RPMS00c1YwdW91bzdkTFRfakxCYUxpeXVONG8wMGNlRmI1ZmRCS2trNm1ROXdaaXlPTl9vMHloaTFYc0pIRDc2ZFZjVVBsNVExVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-modal-body" id="sTop_Bar_0_0_23_0_0_13_1"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 86 65" fill="none"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_10068_937)"&gt;&lt;path d="M83.0003 61.8788V2.99927H3.00058V61.8788H83.0003Z" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M3.74396 3.74927L38.2558 38.7207C40.8139 41.2985 45.4686 41.268 47.9726 38.7442L82.4608 4.03073" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M4.92966 59.9398L31.3724 32.9077" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M80.7678 59.6279L55.038 33.2822" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_10068_937"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h3 class="newsletter-modal__headline"&gt;Best Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text-medium"&gt;

C. (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is it rude to publicly criticize someone you don’t know while making sweeping assumptions and without even trying to understand their context, but you could also argue that it’s deeply unethical and speaks volumes about the person’s low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public shaming is a way for someone to feel more powerful and ‘superior’ at the expense of others. It feeds their ego because they feel they’re totally in the ‘right’ while everyone else supposedly is living life wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s arrogant. It’s shortsighted. And it’s infuriating. Basically, it’s bullying. And you’d assume that adults know better than to bully strangers. Unfortunately, some people need a wake-up call before they start reevaluating how they treat others. You can only hope that the rude woman in the story will be more polite and stop judging others for things that are none of her business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childbirth can have a very deep impact on a mom’s &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/man-leaves-wife-alone-hospital-c-section/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt;, mental, and emotional well-being. The period after childbirth is generally referred to as postpartum or postnatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/postpartum" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that this can last from six to eight weeks after delivery, during which time the mom’s body returns to its pre-pregnancy state. That being said, the symptoms and changes can last beyond the eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Major body and life changes are happening at the same time during the postpartum period. […] Giving birth is a major physical and emotional challenge. Being a caregiver and adjusting to life with an infant during the postpartum period is also incredibly demanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childbirth is incredibly personal, so there’s no one-size-fits-all timeline for the postpartum period, but there are some general things that you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_5" align="center" data-pwa-ad="0" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-ad="empty"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New moms must regularly check in with their doctors after delivery to ensure they stay healthy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="old-lady-bad-having-baby-traumatize-new-mom5" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/old-lady-bad-having-baby-traumatize-new-mom/?image_id=old-lady-bad-having-baby-traumatize-new-mom5.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="This Is My Baby Sister.

Swelling can sometimes cause chest pain and trouble breathing, and in those cases, it can be a sign of something more serious, so it’s important to have regular check-ins with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just your body that changes after childbirth. There are lots of potential emotional symptoms, too, including feeling sad and teary (so-called ‘baby blues’), postpartum depression, postpartum anxiety, and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/weight-loss" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/art/" class=" staff-link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; that postpartum care should be an ongoing process, rather than a single visit after childbirth. Get in touch with your doctor within the first two to three weeks after delivery, whether that’s in person or by phone. Then, go get a complete postpartum exam six to twelve weeks after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things that you should consider talking about with your doctor during that visit include your mood and emotional well-being, how well (or poorly) you’re sleeping, any tiredness you have, baby care and feeding, birth control and birth spacing, pain, adjusting to life with a new baby, and anything related to intimacy with your partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a complete stranger come up to you and start criticizing you for something random? Has anyone ever ranted at you in public about your &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/parenting/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;parenting&lt;/a&gt; decisions? What advice would you give &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/mom-in-tears-return-to-work-premature-baby-nicu/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;new parents&lt;/a&gt; who feel overwhelmed by it all?

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus recently made news headlines as the cause of death for Betsy Arakawa, the wife of actor Gene Hackman, but little is commonly known about it other than its connection to rodents.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Virginia Tech researchers have gained a better understanding of this insidious virus by studying its rodent hosts in North America. Using National Science Foundation data, they found three hotspots of hantavirus circulation in wildlife—Virginia, Colorado, and Texas—and identified 15 &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rodent+species/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rodent species&lt;/a&gt; as carriers, including six species that had not previously been identified as hosts of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of their study was &lt;a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.70209" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Ecosphere&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This project is timely because hantavirus is considered an emerging disease of pandemic potential with symptoms that resemble severe COVID-19 infections," said Paanwaris Paansri, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hantaviruses are a family of viruses that have been identified in regions all over the globe and can reach mortality rates similar to other diseases of high concern, such as nipah and Ebola. In Asia, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/hemorrhagic+fever/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hemorrhagic fever&lt;/a&gt; with renal syndrome is caused by the Hantaan virus, in Europe that syndrome is caused by the Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and in North and South America, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by Sin Nombre virus and Andes virus—all hantaviruses. Sin Nombre virus was first discovered in New Mexico in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the ecology of hantaviruses in wildlife except that the pathogen is spread to humans by inhalation of aerosolized excreta, urine, or saliva from asymptomatic rodent hosts, and it can be fatal in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Tech team used data from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network program to gain a better understanding of hantavirus circulation in its sylvatic cycle—the pathogen's life cycle in wildlife—by examining the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/environmental+influences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental influences&lt;/a&gt; and geographical distribution of the rodent hosts. The program collected and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 species at 45 field sites across the United States from 2014-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In North America, Peromyscus maniculatus, the deer mouse, is the most common carrier but our study also revealed that other rodent species have a higher prevalence of hantavirus, which changes the current paradigm in hantavirus circulation in wildlife," said Paansri, whose mentor Associate Professor Luis E. Escobar led the study and is an affiliate with the Fralin Life Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This new information is expected to help us understand where and when hantavirus is most likely to occur, which is crucial for predicting outbreaks and informing public health officials."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of six new rodent species of hantavirus hosts is significant. Some of these newly discovered hosts inhabit regions where traditional hosts, such as the deer mouse or the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), are absent, meaning they could be potential reservoirs of the virus in new or overlooked areas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This expands our understanding of the basic biology of the virus and shows that the virus is more adaptable than previously believed," Paansri said. "This has direct implications for surveillance strategies and risk assessments and can help explain some cases of hantavirus in humans where the main reservoir is absent or rare."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to expanding the known host species, the researchers were able to gain a better understanding of seasonal trends and effects of seasonal weather shifts. For example, warmer winters and increased precipitation can increase rodent populations and drier conditions can facilitate the generation of contaminated dust containing particulates from rodent excrement and saliva, increasing the risk of transmission to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Climate change can cause population increases or distributional shifts of rodents, altering the epidemiology of hantavirus," Paansri said. "These fluctuations can lead to more frequent rodent-human interactions and increase the chance of spillover. We found some evidence that rodent demography and hantavirus prevalence can be predicted months in advance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual number of human cases of hantavirus infections is largely unknown, according to Paansri, because many infections remain silent, meaning the infected individual may not develop any symptoms or the symptoms could mirror other diseases, such as the common cold or influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to further explore the extent to which climatic variations influence hantavirus transmission in wildlife and in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that many lessons learned from this study can be generalized to other wildlife diseases, considering that their distribution is global," Paansri said.&lt;/p&gt;

Infrequently used buildings such as sheds, cabins, storage facilities, campgrounds and construction sites are particularly at risk for rodent infestation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-protect-yourself-against-hantavirus" class="subhead"&gt;How can you protect yourself against hantavirus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus cases can occur year-round, but the peak seasons for reported cases in the United States are spring and early summer — which coincide with the reproductive seasons for deer mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To limit the risk of infection, avoid rodents, their droppings and nesting materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, do what you can to keep wild rodents out of your home, workplace, cabin, shed, car, camper, or other closed space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/VectorHantaVirus.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles County public health officials suggest&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sealing up holes (the width of a pencil or larger) and other openings where rodents like mice can get in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place snap traps to catch any rodents (The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/media/pdfs/2025/01/HantavirusBrochure-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC cautions against&lt;/a&gt; using glue traps or live traps because they can scare the rodents, causing them to urinate, which increases your chance of exposure to any virus they may be carrying.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store all food items in rodent-proof containers .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you discover evidence of mice in your home or workplace, set up snap traps and clean up their waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that occurs, local and state officials offer the following guidance on how to clean up while protecting yourself against exposure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you clean: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air out the space you will be cleaning for 30 minutes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get rubber or plastic gloves, an N-95 mask and a disinfectant or a mixture of bleach and water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cleaning (with gloves on): &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spray the contaminated areas with your disinfectant and let it soak for at least 5 minutes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not sweep or vacuum the area — that could stir up droppings or other infectious materials into the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use paper towels, a sponge, or a mop to clean. Put all cleaning materials into a bag and toss it in your trash bin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-to-expect-if-you-do-contract-the-hantavirus" class="subhead"&gt;What to expect if you do contract the hantavirus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, which include fever, headache, muscle aches and difficulty breathing. Some people also experience nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms usually develop weeks after breathing in air contaminated by infected deer mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can lead to damaged lung tissues and fluid buildup in the lungs, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351838" target="_blank"&gt;the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It can also affect heart function; severe cases may result in failure of the heart to deliver oxygen to the body. The signs to look out for include cough, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and irregular heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-do-to-treat-hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome" class="subhead"&gt;What can you do to treat hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t specific treatment or a cure for the disease, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome/treatment" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Lung Assn&lt;/a&gt;. However, early medical care can increase the chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the virus is detected early and the infected person receives medical attention in an intensive care unit, the ALA said, there is a chance the person will improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICU treatment may include intubation and oxygen therapy, fluid replacement and use of medications to lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms become severe call your healthcare provider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:15:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQVzVhSHp2eFpRbFM5OEVyRWtDdzRUN0R4bzlwZkk5U2ItRmoyV2RVZUJTQ0t1S25zQTVmZXY2NEpod3doZjk1VkpKYUM1TXRtRWFLX28wd0tmUmlyUDRESE1RSEdGVWM1SWxfdjFfR0ZCb0podzEwVGhsZDJTU3d0aXktdmM2cWRrVEQwaVJKdUF2bWFhclJhQnI2Vy1IdnJYdV84</guid></item><item><title>Infectious Updates 4-10-2025 - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPUHlBMHVlV285eVcxdGNfRE4xREk4OXAtbWtacFZ2dWkzWHJUY09pMzc1QWlZeThMOGdEUWgtcU5VYTFRbXlkWEVOUVU5dFdIWm1NYlNNT2NkdnpBeGx3UmdCQThIYnJIQk9oclVPVjcxY0RhQk5zTVlud2lrM19PeU91QWE3VWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Indiana just reported a cluster of 5 related measles cases, in Allen County where the vaccination rate is only 80%. &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/indiana-measles-outbreak-2025-department-health-reports-5-more-cases-allen-county/16149762/" target="_blank"&gt;these are related also to the first case.&lt;/a&gt; Hold onto your hats. And don’t give RFK Jr any credit for belatedly and reluctantly admitting that the vaccine is the best prevention measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten Texas counties now have ongoing transmission, and make up 95% of the cases in the state. Seven cases in Lubbock &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/cases-top-500-outbreak-area-expands-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;are tied to exposure at a daycare center.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.diff is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/clostridium-difficile/study-highlights-hidden-spread-c-diff-icus" target="_blank"&gt;spreading in ICUs&lt;/a&gt; on surfaces, and hands or gloves of healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A three year old girl in Coahuila state, Mexico, has died of H5N1flu.  Her exposure might have been related to a nearby poultry farm, but is not confirmed. &lt;a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/girl-aged-3-is-mexicos-first-human-death-from-h5n1-bird-flu" target="_blank"&gt;StraitsTimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/betsy-arakawa-hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome-b2715984.html" target="_blank"&gt;Hantavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is contracted when people come into contact with infected deer mouse droppings, urine, or saliva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to emphasize that as far as we know, none of these deceased individuals engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste,” Dr. Boo said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead, these folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This virus has a high fatality rate.  It was the cause of death for Gene Hackman's wife several weeks ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK reports &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/uk-reports-clade-1b-mpox-case-no-travel-history-or-links-earlier-cases" target="_blank"&gt;a case of clade 1b mpox&lt;/a&gt; with no travel history or contact with known earlier cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyoming found 14% of deer and elk tested were positive for CWD. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chronic-wasting-disease/wyoming-reports-14-cwd-prevalence-tested-deer-elk" target="_blank"&gt;Far more in deer than elk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials tested 5,276 samples in 2024 from mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, and moose—members of the deer family also known as cervids. The samples were from hunter-harvested, targeted, and road-killed animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of hunter-harvested male mule deer tested, 19.4% came back positive, an increase from 18.9% in 2023. Of hunter-harvested white-tailed bucks, 29.2% tested positive, down slightly from 30.3% in 2023. And 2.3% of adult hunter-harvested elk tested positive, which was down from 2.8% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A cruel consequence of advanced cancer is the profound apathy many patients experience as they lose interest in once-cherished activities. This symptom is part of a syndrome called cachexia, which affects about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/cachexia"&gt;80% of late-stage cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, leading to severe muscle wasting and weight loss that leave patients bone thin despite adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This loss of motivation doesn’t just deepen patients’ suffering, it isolates them from family and friends. Because patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5476"&gt;struggle to engage with demanding therapies&lt;/a&gt; that require effort and persistence, it also strains families and complicates treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically assume that when late-stage cancer patients withdraw from life, it is an inevitable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2354.2002.00283.x"&gt;psychological response to physical deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. But what if apathy isn’t just a byproduct of physical decline but an integral part of the disease itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our newly published research, my colleagues &lt;a href="https://kepecslab.org/"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; have discovered something remarkable: Cancer doesn’t simply waste the body – it &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;hijacks a specific brain circuit that controls motivation&lt;/a&gt;. Our findings, published in the journal Science, challenge decades of assumptions and suggest it might be possible to restore what many cancer patients describe as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0b013e3181f45b90"&gt;most devastating to lose&lt;/a&gt; – their will to engage with life.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Untangling fatigue from physical decline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To unravel the puzzle of apathy in cancer cachexia, we needed to trace the exact path inflammation takes in the body and peer inside a living brain while the disease is progressing – something impossible in people. However, neuroscientists have advanced technologies that make this possible in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern neuroscience equips us with a powerful &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/illuminating-the-brain-one-neuron-and-synapse-at-a-time-5-essential-reads-about-how-researchers-are-using-new-tools-to-map-its-structure-and-function-187607"&gt;arsenal of tools&lt;/a&gt; to probe how disease changes brain activity in mice. Scientists can &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/mapping-how-the-100-billion-cells-in-the-brain-all-fit-together-is-the-brave-new-world-of-neuroscience-170182"&gt;map entire brains&lt;/a&gt; at the cellular level, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/illuminating-the-brain-one-neuron-and-synapse-at-a-time-5-essential-reads-about-how-researchers-are-using-new-tools-to-map-its-structure-and-function-187607"&gt;track neural activity&lt;/a&gt; during behavior, and precisely &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/brain-stimulation-can-rewire-and-heal-damaged-neural-connections-but-it-isnt-clear-how-research-suggests-personalization-may-be-key-to-more-effective-therapies-182491"&gt;switch neurons on or off&lt;/a&gt;. We used these neuroscience tools in a mouse model of cancer cachexia to study the effects of the disease on the brain and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified a small brain region called the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1073858407311100"&gt;area postrema&lt;/a&gt; that acts as the brain’s inflammation detector. As a tumor grows, it releases cytokines − molecules that trigger inflammation − into the bloodstream. The area postrema lacks the typical blood-brain barrier that keeps out toxins, pathogens and other molecules from the body, allowing it to directly sample circulating inflammatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the area postrema detects a rise in inflammatory molecules, it triggers a neural cascade across multiple brain regions, ultimately suppressing dopamine release in the brain’s motivation center − the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.03.003"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;. While commonly misconstrued as a “pleasure chemical,” dopamine is actually associated with drive, or the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/422573a"&gt;willingness to put in effort to gain rewards&lt;/a&gt;: It tips the internal cost-benefit scale toward action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/660902/original/file-20250409-56-7jk4kj.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Researchers measured effort through two tests.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;Reprinted with permission from XA Zu et al., Science 388:eadm8857 (2025)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;directly observed this shift&lt;/a&gt; using two quantitative tests designed with behavioral economics principles to measure effort. In the first, mice repeatedly poked their noses into a food port, with progressively more pokes required to earn each food pellet. In the second task, mice repeatedly crossed a bridge between two water ports, each gradually depleting with use and forcing the mice to switch sides to replenish the supply, similar to picking berries until a bush is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cancer progressed, mice still pursued easy rewards but quickly abandoned tasks requiring greater effort. Meanwhile, we watched dopamine levels fall in real time, precisely mirroring the mice’s decreasing willingness to work for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that cancer isn’t just generally “wearing out” the brain − it sends targeted inflammatory signals that the brain detects. The brain then responds by rapidly reducing dopamine levels to &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;dial down motivation&lt;/a&gt;. This matches what patients describe: “Everything feels too hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Restoring motivation in late-stage disease&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most exciting, we found &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;several ways to restore motivation&lt;/a&gt; in mice suffering from cancer cachexia − even when the cancer itself continued progressing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, by genetically switching off the inflammation-sensing neurons in the area postrema, or by directly stimulating neurons to release dopamine, we were able to restore normal motivation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we found that giving mice a drug that blocks a particular cytokine − working similarly to existing FDA-approved arthritis treatments − also proved effective. While the drug did not reverse physical wasting, it restored the mice’s willingness to work for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these results are based on mouse models, they suggest a treatment possibility for people: Targeting this specific inflammation-dopamine circuit could improve quality of life for cancer patients, even when the disease remains incurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boundary between physical and psychological symptoms is an &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/"&gt;artificially drawn line&lt;/a&gt;. Cancer ignores this division, using inflammation to commandeer the very circuits that drive a patient’s will to act. But our findings suggest these messages can be intercepted and the circuits restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Cancer treatment can demand tremendous effort from patients.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/rear-view-of-a-patient-at-the-hospital-looking-royalty-free-image/1318327391"&gt;FG Trade/E+ via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking apathy in disease&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our discovery has implications far beyond cancer. The inflammatory molecule driving loss of motivation in cancer is also &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2011/765624"&gt;involved in numerous other conditions&lt;/a&gt; − from autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis to chronic infections and depression. This same brain circuit might explain the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13072058"&gt;debilitating apathy&lt;/a&gt; that millions of people suffering from various chronic diseases experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apathy triggered by inflammation may have originally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2015.5"&gt;evolved as a protective mechanism&lt;/a&gt;. When early humans faced acute infections, dialing down motivation made sense − it conserved energy and directed resources toward recovery. But what once helped people survive short-term illnesses turns harmful when inflammation persists chronically, as it does in cancer and other diseases. Rather than &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-sick-is-an-emotion-meant-to-help-you-get-better-faster-126915"&gt;aiding survival&lt;/a&gt;, prolonged apathy deepens suffering, worsening health outcomes and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While translating these findings into therapies for people requires more research, our discovery reveals a promising target for treatment. By intercepting inflammatory signals or modulating brain circuits, researchers may be able to restore a patient’s drive. For patients and families watching motivation slip away, that possibility offers something powerful: hope that even as disease progresses, the essence of who we are might be reclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the average healthy adult, it might not make much difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-11224d20-162f-11f0-badc-0bba99d0c91e"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; State University team behind the analysis said it could pose risks to young children whose brains are still developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found that children between the ages of six to 24 months who ate brown rice had approximately twice the estimated arsenic exposure compared to those consuming white rice in similar quantities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early exposure to arsenic, a naturally occurring chemical element found in the Earth's crust, has been linked to lower IQ, reduced memory, learning difficulties and more serious brain conditions like autism and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-0c874130-162f-11f0-badc-0bba99d0c91e" class=""&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Felicia Wu, a professor at the university and the senior author of the study noted: 'This research is important because it acknowledges the importance of considering food safety along with nutrition when consumers make choices about food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While we found that choosing brown rice over white rice would result in higher arsenic exposure on average, the levels should not cause long-term health problems unless someone ate an enormous amount of brown rice every day for years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Opting to buy a bag of brown rice instead of white for your family may make your children sick and increase your risk for cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brown rice has more arsenic due the accumulation of the toxic chemical in the outer brown layer of the grain, known as rice bran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the rice bran gives the brown rice its color, it is removed during the milling process to produce white rice - therefore decreasing its arsenic concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts reviewed dozens on the nutritional aspects of brown and white rice and then analyzed data from the 'What We Eat in America' database compiled by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Joint Institute of Food Science and Applied Nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once they found out how much rice Americans in different age groups consume from the database, they calculated the average daily dose (ADD) of arsenic exposure using a formula that considered arsenic levels in rice, daily rice consumption and average body weight for different age cohorts. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With these numbers, they compared arsenic exposure from white rice versus brown rice and examined exposure patterns across different age groups - with particular attention to children under five years old. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the total arsenic found in the rice, 48 percent was the inorganic form - meaning that the toxic substance had combined with other elements such as oxygen, chlorine or sulfur and could cause more damage than organic arsenic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in white rice, it was 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Arsenic comes in two forms: Inorganic arsenic (the dangerous kind – linked to cancer, developmental issues, etc.) Organic arsenic (less toxic, found naturally in some seafood including fish, shellfish and seaweed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, brown rice grown in the rest of the world had a staggering 65 percent inorganic concentration level while white rice also had a shocking 53 percent concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US rice industry produces 20 billion pounds of rice annually, out of which 80 percent is consumed by Americans itself while it imports about 1.3 million tons of the grain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, rice bran - the outer layer that makes rice 'brown' - was found to contain arsenic concentrations roughly 10 times higher than the rice endosperm (the white interior portion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also found that infants and toddlers between the ages of six to 24 months consuming brown rice might ingest arsenic at levels of 0.29 to 0.59 micrograms per kilogram of body weight daily - exceeding the recommended safe limit of 0.21 micrograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Felicia Wu, a professor at the university and the senior author of the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Children between the ages of six to 24 months who ate brown rice had approximately twice the estimated arsenic exposure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rice bran and brown rice are shown to have a higher arsenic content and inorganic arsenic concentration than the grain endosperm or white rice,' the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inorganic arsenic is a naturally occurring form of arsenic that is toxic element and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust,. It can be found in soil, water and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In comparison to other crops planted in the soil, rice naturally absorbs more arsenic- taking up nearly 10 times more arsenic than other grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This happens because rice grows in flooded paddies, creating conditions where arsenic becomes more available through water as well as the soil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once absorbed through the roots, the toxic compound accumulates primarily in the outer layers of the rice grain known as rice bran.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of white rice, rice bran is precisely the part that is removed during processing to bring out the white color of the grain - which reduced its overall arsenic concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In comparison to other crops planted in the soil, rice naturally absorbs more arsenic- taking up nearly 10 times more arsenic than other grain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA warns that long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic can cause arsenic poisoning, skin disorders and increased risks for skin, bladder and lung cancers as well as for cardiovascular diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exposure to high levels of arsenic during times of active brain development (infants  and toddlers) is also associated with adverse neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ - paving the way for conditions such as autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, short-term exposure to very high amounts of inorganic arsenic can result in nausea, vomiting, bruising and numbness or burning sensations in the hands and feet in people of any age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While precise annual deaths from arsenic exposure in the US are difficult to pinpoint due to various causes and potential misattribution, studies suggest that about 500 annual premature deaths from heart disease and 1,000 annual cancer cases are due to exposure to arsenic through drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016, three Americans died from arsenic poisoning, the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, arsenic poisoning due to drinking contaminated water affects at least 140 million people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p class="" data-start="73" data-end="493"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the world of wellness, Japan often holds quiet secrets to health that the rest of us are only just discovering. From mindful eating to balanced living, Japanese practices have long been admired for promoting longevity and natural weight management. One of these techniques, recently highlighted by beauty entrepreneur Sonmi, has gained attention not just for its simplicity—but for its scientific backing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="495" data-end="832"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This subtle yet effective approach is all about keeping your body warm, inside and out. It may sound counterintuitive, but avoiding cold drinks and maintaining internal warmth could be the key to boosting metabolism and aiding weight loss—without the extreme dieting or punishing workouts we often associate with shedding pounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id="more-5498"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="834" data-end="875"&gt;Why Metabolism Matters for Weight Loss ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="877" data-end="1140"&gt;At its core, &lt;strong data-start="890" data-end="904"&gt;metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the set of chemical reactions in the body that convert food into &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/amazing-panel-generates-energy-from-water-flow-see-how/"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;. This process powers everything from breathing to cell repair. The more efficiently your metabolism runs, the more calories your body burns—even at rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="1142" data-end="1463"&gt;But here’s where it gets interesting: our metabolism is also closely linked to &lt;strong data-start="1221" data-end="1252"&gt;body temperature regulation&lt;/strong&gt;. When your body temperature drops, your internal processes—including calorie burning—can slow down. Conversely, keeping your core warm can &lt;strong data-start="1392" data-end="1422"&gt;support metabolic activity&lt;/strong&gt; and even encourage the breakdown of fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1465" data-end="1753"&gt;This is especially true for a specific type of fat called &lt;strong data-start="1523" data-end="1547"&gt;brown adipose tissue&lt;/strong&gt; (or brown fat). Unlike white fat, which stores energy, brown fat &lt;strong data-start="1613" data-end="1648"&gt;burns calories to generate heat&lt;/strong&gt;—a process known as &lt;strong data-start="1668" data-end="1685"&gt;thermogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;. The more active this brown fat is, the more energy your body uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1465" data-end="1753"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1755" data-end="1808"&gt;Warm Body, Fast Metabolism: A Japanese Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1810" data-end="2170"&gt;Sonmi, founder of the skincare brand Meeth, shared that many Japanese women make a conscious effort to avoid chilling their bodies, even in the height of summer. “I never drink iced beverages,” she says. “If your body cools down, your metabolism slows and cellular regeneration decreases. That’s why we always try to keep warm, both externally and internally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="2172" data-end="2554"&gt;While it may sound like cultural tradition, modern research backs this up. Studies suggest that &lt;strong data-start="2268" data-end="2320"&gt;maintaining a slightly elevated core temperature&lt;/strong&gt; may be associated with benefits like &lt;strong data-start="2358" data-end="2383"&gt;lower risk of obesity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="2385" data-end="2413"&gt;improved immune function&lt;/strong&gt;, and even &lt;strong data-start="2424" data-end="2451"&gt;greater life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, this isn’t just an old wives’ tale—it’s a strategy rooted in both wisdom and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2556" data-end="2616"&gt;Practical Ways to Support Body Temperature and Metabolism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2618" data-end="2784"&gt;You don’t need to relocate to Japan or radically overhaul your routine to take advantage of this technique. Here are a few simple ways to apply it to your daily life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="" data-start="2786" data-end="2838"&gt;1. &lt;strong data-start="2793" data-end="2838"&gt;Expose Yourself to the Cold—Strategically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2839" data-end="3103"&gt;Ironically, brief exposure to cold can help &lt;em data-start="2883" data-end="2893"&gt;activate&lt;/em&gt; brown fat. Try ending your shower with a burst of cold water, going for walks in brisk weather, or lowering your indoor temperature slightly. These habits stimulate thermogenesis, increasing your calorie burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="" data-start="3105" data-end="3145"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-start="3112" data-end="3145"&gt;Incorporate Thermogenic Foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3146" data-end="3430"&gt;Certain foods naturally raise your body’s temperature. &lt;strong data-start="3201" data-end="3214"&gt;Green tea&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="3216" data-end="3233"&gt;chili peppers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="3235" data-end="3245"&gt;ginger&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="3251" data-end="3273"&gt;caffeinated drinks&lt;/strong&gt; like coffee are known to boost metabolism by encouraging thermogenesis. Adding a bit of spice to your meals might do more than just wake up your taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="" data-start="3432" data-end="3489"&gt;3. &lt;strong data-start="3439" data-end="3489"&gt;Exercise (Especially High-Intensity Intervals)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3490" data-end="3724"&gt;Physical activity, particularly &lt;strong data-start="3522" data-end="3539"&gt;HIIT workouts&lt;/strong&gt;, not only burns calories during the workout but also increases your internal temperature for hours afterward. Even a brisk walk or yoga session can give your metabolism a gentle nudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="" data-start="3726" data-end="3750"&gt;4. &lt;strong data-start="3733" data-end="3750"&gt;Stay Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3751" data-end="3985"&gt;Drinking water—especially cold water—can slightly increase your energy expenditure as your body warms it up. Plus, proper hydration is essential for &lt;strong data-start="3900" data-end="3923"&gt;efficient digestion&lt;/strong&gt; and cellular function, both crucial for a healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="" data-start="3987" data-end="4022"&gt;5. &lt;strong data-start="3994" data-end="4022"&gt;Prioritize Quality Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4023" data-end="4259"&gt;When you’re sleep-deprived, your &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/china-has-discovered-a-solution-to-power-smartwatches-indefinitely-by-harnessing-body-heat/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; struggles to regulate its temperature, and your metabolism may take a hit. &lt;strong data-start="4136" data-end="4158"&gt;Good sleep hygiene&lt;/strong&gt; helps stabilize internal systems, including hormonal functions that influence hunger and energy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="4261" data-end="4303"&gt;The Takeaway: Small Shifts, Big Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4305" data-end="4641"&gt;This Japanese technique doesn’t require a complicated supplement routine or hours at the gym. It simply encourages us to &lt;strong data-start="4426" data-end="4462"&gt;tune into our body’s temperature&lt;/strong&gt;, eat mindfully, and move regularly. Combined, these habits can support a &lt;strong data-start="4536" data-end="4562"&gt;more active metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, improve &lt;strong data-start="4572" data-end="4597"&gt;fat-burning potential&lt;/strong&gt;, and promote a greater sense of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="4643" data-end="4849"&gt;As with all things wellness, there’s no one-size-fits-all fix. But the idea of warming up from within—both literally and figuratively—might be just the kind of &lt;strong data-start="4803" data-end="4832"&gt;gentle, sustainable shift&lt;/strong&gt; many of us need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEBSTER GROVES, Mo. — A bat found inside a Webster Groves home on April 3 recently tested positive for rabies, triggering warnings from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the region's first bat to have a rabies-positive test in 2025, the St. Louis County Department of Public Health said. Bat activity occurs throughout the county and the potential for bats with rabies isn't limited to any specific community within the county.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/local/st-louis-county-bat-in-house-rabies-warning/63-4cce55fc-562a-4585-8908-036096ab9f3e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Officials in 2024&lt;/a&gt; started seeing more bats in homes compared with previous years but weren't sure why.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have seen an increase and I'm not sure what the increase is attributable to," Senior Epidemiologist and Supervisor for the Communicable Disease Investigation Program Amanda Brzozowski told 5 On Your Side last year. "Is it that there are more bats? More active bats? Is it that people now know that they can call animal control and tell us they have bats?"&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department shared the following tips for people who find a bat in their home in a press release:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not attempt to capture a live bat. Instead, confine it to the room where it was discovered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never release a bat found in a home if it was present where people were sleeping or if it was in a room with anyone who cannot describe the nature and extent of their exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saint Louis County residents should call DPH Animal Care and Control immediately so animal control officers can collect the bat for possible rabies testing. According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, bats can be removed from inside a home at any time of the year, including during breeding season.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you think you may have been exposed to a bat, Saint Louis County residents can call DPH communicable disease investigators (314-615-1630) to discuss the possible need for a rabies vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

However, Stoner said doctors dismissed her symptoms, telling her she was “too young” to have any concerning health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People would say it was just that time of the month or that it was just ‘female stuff’ but I thought, no — it can't be that painful," she told Kennedy News and Media via &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14587993/Arkansas-Sydney-Stoner-stage-4-cancer-IBS.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “When I finally spoke to a doctor, he told me I was too young for it to be anything serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-25-shocking-colon-cancer-diagnosis-hours-before-turned-fatal-8788944" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mom Receives Shocking Stage 3 Colon Cancer Diagnosis at 25 — Hours Before It Nearly Turned Fatal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mom Receives Shocking Stage 3 Colon Cancer Diagnosis at 25 — Hours Before It Nearly Turned Fatal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt; Sydney Stoner in the hospital for stage 4 bowel cancer&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At that point, I wasn't really given any other explanation, but I do remember one doctor saying it was probably IBS,” she added, referring to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoner’s pain ultimately continued, explaining that it felt like her “insides were being twisted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to continue dealing with her pain, Stoner — who had gotten married the previous year — decided to lie to her doctors about having blood in her stool, a symptom she knew they couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had to lie to get my colonoscopy,” she said. “I told them there was blood in my stool because they kept saying I needed a referral first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After telling the lie, Stoner received a referral for a colonoscopy and underwent the procedure in September 2020. Doctors informed her that they struggled to complete the procedure because they discovered a five-millimeter tumor blocking access to her colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt; Sydney Stoner's surgery scar&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/groom-35-learns-he-has-tumor-after-doctors-said-he-was-too-young-for-cancer-11692837" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Groom, 35, Learns He Has Tumor ‘the Size of an Orange’ After Doctors Insisted He Was ‘Too Young’ for Cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Groom, 35, Learns He Has Tumor ‘the Size of an Orange’ After Doctors Insisted He Was ‘Too Young’ for Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 27, Stoner was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer after her tumor, which originated in her bowel, had spread to her liver and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the doctors told me it was cancer, my whole world stopped spinning,” she recalled. “We were newlyweds, excited for this new chapter, and it all just came to a halt. I was terrified, but I was also really frustrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctors said I was too young but I probably would have died before I made it to the screening age of 45,” she told the outlet. “It was very frustrating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in the world, after lung and breast cancers.

She also began chemotherapy to treat the cancer in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has since had 24 rounds of chemotherapy and is now considered “stable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoner, now 31, is now encouraging others to stay on top of their health and advocate for themselves regardless of the age recommendations for screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know it's difficult but keep advocating for yourself because no one else is going to get that done for you,” she added. "Find a new doctor, or whatever that may be. Find someone to listen to you because I know people that were diagnosed at 18 years old."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The screening age needs to be lower or there shouldn't be one at all,” Stoner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-27-tells-a-lie-to-get-colonoscopy-that-catches-stage-4-cancer-11712811" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 17:00:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5nLVd0MUxpdFp0WFhqcFVsS2xMRmVkVzNBUzFKaHF0a1BfMDg0OXNzUmgwX01BeUJ1Z3RxVW9FYVVmR0NNdEdCU3hsVVdWWHVSVXdyLWdQWDJiYVNnNDBQWF8tMDFTOEdVdE9ESGZFS0EyZUhvSDVFNHFkYw</guid></item><item><title>Stress is contagious.

The way stress spreads depends a lot on how each species communicates,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ZF8FAZ6XYD4Y5FFFYKVMZ7BE70" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ZF8FAZ6XYD4Y5FFFYKVMZ7BE70"&gt;How social interactions help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MV32LIEQUVCXFCICGDXY6FCWBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But on the flip side of the social contagion coin is the benefit of social buffering, Duque-Wilckens said. When a person or animal that has been exposed to a stressor has the opportunity to interact with another individual, it reduces their stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1YPR5FM5G52T73T44JZN0YY000" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Social interaction really has a positive impact on us, because it just helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2921311/"&gt;downregulate the stress response&lt;/a&gt; faster,” Brandl said. Poor social connections are also associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf"&gt;host of illnesses&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPXZFRMZYVC7LDBRAZ22SNOGPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A stressed person may, in the short term, negatively affect the people doing the consoling, Duque-Wilckens said. “But, at the same time, this reciprocal mechanism helps to maintain the stability of the group in the long term,” she said. In the future, she said, the roles may be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I4ZBHYJAE5HJZPE2LFRSR2RUUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stress is rooted in unpredictability and uncontrollability, Dimitroff said. “If you have quality social relationships in your life, you will, by definition, feel like life is more controllable and more predictable, because you know you’ll get that support when you need it,” she said. “If something bad happens, you’ll have a hand to hold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="4XTG0BU6H92W13HND1T3XK7MNW" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="4XTG0BU6H92W13HND1T3XK7MNW"&gt;Take a moment to step back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VOVFPCVKYJCPNEMD3JJWWR5SF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers still don’t know all of the variables that make some individuals more prone to stress contagion, but it is clear that empathy plays a role. A person with empathy deeply feels the emotions of others. That could be stress, but also emotions of happiness, anger or fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F38QDWX9TN0RQ5GZ1J7B680XC0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“And that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

If you’re having trouble &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/04/stress-body-brain-reduce-steps/"&gt;breaking free from stress&lt;/a&gt;, Dimitroff said, try to find places in your life where you can improve controllability and predictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HDFJHHG9ZD7CF7NPMQB8X0X5DR" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HDFJHHG9ZD7CF7NPMQB8X0X5DR"&gt;Do something you love&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7NZRAVHDHNFLXNSZOCL5HQ7K5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Withdrawing for a bit and doing something you love, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/birds-song-nature-mental-health-benefits/"&gt;going out in nature&lt;/a&gt;, can help you avoid negativity that brings stress, Duque-Wilckens said. “That’s my go-to,” she said. “Be in nature, paint, hang out with my cats or my dog.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="M184JZ5AB119D39UM4RH4402X4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="M184JZ5AB119D39UM4RH4402X4"&gt;Be mindful&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6AME04YE616TZA1C27ZVUU6C0R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And be mindful not to contribute to the problem, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYDJVX7KEH5557URHBXRVZK13C" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s a very fine line between sharing information you think is important to raise awareness and overdoing it by constantly, and too quickly, sharing stressful news without taking time to reflect,” Duque-Wilckens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D4SGTKSQKZBDTBAZPZPTHP6MLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about human behavior or neuroscience?

				&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/hebrew-university" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; have created a new antibiotic eyedrop formulation for &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/pets" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; that significantly improves how long the medicine remains effective on the eye—an innovation that could also benefit human patients. The findings, published this week in Veterinary Ophthalmology, suggest a major step forward in treating bacterial eye infections and curbing antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared two carriers for the antibiotics cefazolin and chloramphenicol: the commonly used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cross-linked hyaluronic acid (XHA). They discovered that XHA greatly outperformed PVA, delivering 2.4 times more exposure for cefazolin and 4.2 times more for chloramphenicol, while also staying on the eye for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"XHA enhances antibiotic retention on the ocular surface, leading to improved treatment efficacy, reduced dosing frequency, and boosted compliance," the researchers said. They noted that XHA also offers its own antibacterial properties, helps heal corneal wounds, and improves tear quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;  Bone Street dog bed /  (credit: PR)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why research dogs? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/dogs" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; were used in the study because their eye structure and diseases closely resemble those of humans, making them a more accurate model than rabbits or rodents commonly used in preclinical testing. The improved retention of antibiotics could reduce how often &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/medicine" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; need to be applied, which may lower the risk of drug resistance—an increasing concern in both human and veterinary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research could open the door to applying XHA-based delivery methods for other eye treatments, including antivirals, antifungals, and anti-inflammatory drugs.

&lt;p&gt;They say that the key to the future lies in our past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given everything we’ve learned in recent years I’m inclined to give credence to the notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in this field is still in its infancy, of course, and our resources are extraordinarily limited—especially given the present state of the galaxy. But we are already making great strides towards learning more about who we once were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summarized version: This is not humanity’s first go-around as a space faring civilization. We were, in fact, a contemporary and rival of the Forerunners over a hundred millennia ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Ancestors of ours moved their empire towards the galactic margin, inhabiting presently unexplored areas of space, which accounts for why we have thus far discovered only a scant few traces of their existence—also accounting for the cultural and genetic reduction that the Forerunners imposed after their war against these humans was won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to our current research is the discovery at Site Yankee-002-G3. A lone Ancestor ship, fully intact. While the modern incarnation of our kind were still huddled in caves, this vessel drifted silently through space… just waiting to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few dozen researchers have been aboard. I’ve got them in rotating shifts. The control group are given just eight hours to access the ship and conduct their analyses before a thirty-six hour “cooldown” period, during which time the other teams are cycled in to operate. It should be noted that this rhythm we’ve put in place goes beyond the standard notion of healthy respite; the ship itself seems to have strange effects on the researchers after prolonged exposure to it. The exact nature of the correlation between duration and influence is something we’ve still yet to determine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attached some of the incident reports for your perusal, and I am sure you will agree that this is currently the most prudent course of action. We must balance further encouragement of these odd developments with our capacity to continue standard research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will follow up soon as further developments come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know we work long hours, but I’m concerned about Jackson. He looks like he’s sleepwalking half the time, he moves like none of the rest of us are even there—he keeps bumping into me while muttering under his breath. Managed to listen in one time and he’s just saying all of our names over and over again. What the hell is that about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCIDENT REPORT 008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FILED BY:&lt;/strong&gt; 02961-30002-DS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I reprimanded Horne earlier today for ignoring his duties. We’ve got a tight timeline to work with while aboard this ship and I caught him skulking around, saying he was trying to find the source of a hum that kept moving whenever he got close to it. I don’t hear any hum, he’s either messing me about or he’s in need of a psychological evaluation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCIDENT REPORT 012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FILED BY:&lt;/strong&gt; 05126-89937-PH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asked Jerry what was on his to-do list today when he said he was watching the walls. I said, What? What’s that supposed to mean? He said he sees things moving in them. Shadows. I said it’s probably just the rest of our team in the room getting set up. He said no, there are too many.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCIDENT REPORT 013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FILED BY:&lt;/strong&gt; 01948-20112-NM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever since we found that suit apparatus that we adapted into Project ENOCH, Hudson has gone completely non-verbal—he just presses his lips together like he’s trying to whistle but doesn’t make a sound. I’m concerned about the null state stasis containers as well. An eclectic variety of objects not accounted for by our inventory have been brought aboard. Holloway swears she saw Hudson laying out his morbid collection of alien bones on the floor, as if it was some kind of ritualistic offering, but when she got another pair of eyes over there they had gone without a trace. I &lt;/em&gt;really&lt;em&gt; need some shore leave...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCIDENT REPORT 015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FILED BY:&lt;/strong&gt; 09136-77903-JF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Had the strangest conversation with Nicholas today and I’m not sure what to make of it. He started talking about his wife back home—strange, of course, because as far as I know he lost his family back on Kholo. But he was recounting his wedding day when suddenly I realized that he was describing &lt;/em&gt;my&lt;em&gt; wedding day. Red wine all over my wife’s dress as we took a tumble during the first dance. He described the incident exactly as I remember it, as I lived it. But that was five years ago—I've only known him for two. He froze up when I told him that was what happened to me and hasn’t spoken to me since.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INCIDENT REPORT 016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FILED BY:&lt;/strong&gt; 03417-31813-TC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earl reported that he’s been having strange dreams lately. He said that he wakes up on the ship and nobody else is there, except for Spartan Niles, who just stands still—fully armored—and keeps asking a question in a voice that isn’t his. I asked Earl what the question was and he just went pale, refused to say anything more after that. Something weird is happening on this ship, man…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the dreamer. That is what she tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says that we only dream about what is already within us. I dream of her, and yet we have never met. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the dreamer, and I am the dream… I do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asks me, is it the future, or is it the past? Then she decides that it does not matter. It is now—and now will never be again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The klaxon blares to signify the end of our shift. She does not want me to go, so I have found a hiding place. I will go there and disappear, and when the others learn that one of their number is missing they will delay the next shift until I am found. Until they decide to send others aboard, I will have the ship all to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you soon, dream/dreamer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the others are all gone, I emerge and begin to peruse the ship. We have not yet gained access to the entirety of this cruiser—it is over six thousand meters in length and many sections have been sealed, remaining undisturbed for countless millennia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approach a large bulkhead door that we have been unable to breach and await her instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feel her stirring in my mind. Sometimes it takes effort to draw her out, like finding someone in a haze of mist. She is as elusive as a half-remembered dream, not yet whole, but she is always there. Perhaps she feels a similar frustration towards me, as if I am a distant shore only faintly visible on the horizon that she cannot reach. But the longer I am here, aboard this ship, the closer we draw together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, she will reach the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says she has things to show me. Things old and forgotten, long buried and longer lost. They did not happen &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, they happened far away in another place, but we must make do. This will be the canvas on which she paints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand by the door and close my eyes, willing my conscious mind to ease and make space for her—another mind, another self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distantly, I am aware of raising a device to my mouth. The fruits of Project ENOCH. And oh, what a gift, this peculiar apparatus that I both do and do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient suits of armor we discovered had these devices beneath the helmet, meant to be affixed to the wearer’s jaw. It made no sense, and yet I saw the sense in it. No ordinary words could be heard, and yet the whistles and clicks that burst through in translation were words to me, as sweet as music. It was a language I almost felt like I could recognize, familiar in the way she is familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all have been so lucky to hear the music, the words, and yet I am not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, there she is. This old machine must surely serve as some kind of guiding beacon for her, or a favorable wind that speeds her towards the shore where I await her deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mouth speaks at her behest, spouting old words filtered through the mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faint lines of energy course through the walls around me, feeding into the door which creaks and groans, straining in its old age after a dark and dreamless sleep… and then it opens, granting me passage beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel a chemical rush within my body. She is pleased by this development, and I am eager to discover what she wishes to reveal to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room beyond is pitch black and there is a chill in the air, but I cross the threshold as if returning to a place I know as home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of our shared dreams then begins to coalesce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blueish light shines through, forming into a cylindrical shape that flows upwards like a reverse waterfall. Within, a shadow takes form—a humanoid figure clad in armor, immobilized within a confinement field. I draw closer and strain to make out further details, but my efforts are rebuffed as eyes squinting in the dark before they’ve adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other shadowy figures begin to take shape, illuminated by the light of the confinement field. Were they standing still, they might have been mistaken as statues. These offer more detail, and I see that the armor covering them from head to toe has no noticeable separation, its angular plating all appears fused together. There is no “helmet” either, the armor around the head slants forward where it breaks away into a triangular shape, within which a single “eye” shines through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The actions of your kind are an affront to the Mantle,”&lt;/em&gt; one of the shadowy armored figures speaks in a high, imperious voice. &lt;em&gt;“Your reckless expansion has devastated ecosystems, displaced populations, and now you resort to razing entire worlds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the embers of old hatred rekindled within me. She wishes me to see this, to share in her righteous anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your commanders have seen the logs I willingly shared,” she says, her voice bold and proud, undaunted by her captivity. “They have seen the Shaping Sickness for themselves. It still resides within this system, and if you do not release me at once and assist in burning it from existence, it will consume us all!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Threats will not serve you, human.”&lt;/em&gt; The statuesque armored being responds. &lt;em&gt;“There is a great deal of uncertainty about your claims. Many believe this ‘Shaping Sickness’ is simply a bioweapon unleashed by your kind, accidentally or otherwise, turned to your advantage as the perfect excuse to expand your empire from the galactic fringes—burning worlds and their civilizations to later resettle them.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are a &lt;em&gt;fool&lt;/em&gt;,” she spits with deep contempt, and so too does my mouth move to form the words. “Hear me now, Forerunner. If you impede my people, the Shaping Sickness will come for your kind, and when it does you will treat it as you do everything else—as something you can study and control.” I feel the venom in her voice recede for a moment as she leans forward and whispers in fear. “You cannot. This parasite is no simple creature of instinct. Its hunger serves a greater desire, a purpose we do not—&lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt;—know. It can only be met with &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; answer: annihilation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her words hang in the air for a moment, during which time the Forerunner figures remain silent—the intelligences within their alloyed second skins no doubt verifying that her words &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; truthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet still they will not listen, will not see. We have been enemies for too long, judged heretical for our own claim to the Mantle. Truth may come later; the possibility of removing another rival is too compelling for them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By the time your people come to the same conclusion as mine,” she grits her teeth, leaning back within the confinement field, “it will be too late for us all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dream fades and her closing words echo, either through the ship or through my own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my legs shake uncontrollably, causing me to fall to the ground. Bringing her to the fore and surrendering control through deep concentration comes, it seems, at an immense physical cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that she is a tulpa. She is mind-made, thought given form, living somewhere deep within my subconscious. Simply being here on this ship has been akin to conducting lightning through a rod. She is neither an alter ego nor a doppelgänger; she is not an assemblage of thoughts given the illusion of coherency and sapience, nor the product of an unwell mind. She was &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; once, I believe. Flesh and blood. But something happened to our species a long time ago which turned her and many others like her into a graft—a layer of slumbering consciousness that lives within us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among my fellow researchers, all of whom have manifested different conditions to varying degrees while aboard this vessel, she is the first and thus far only &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; to have taken shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lie on the ground for… minutes? An hour? I am uncertain. I contemplate withdrawing for now to recuperate and process what I have just seen, but she is reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is now—and now will never be again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on whatever reserves of strength I possess, I stand and shuffle forwards into the dark. There is more yet to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We press on. Whatever area of the ship she helped me to breach is of little interest to her. Her mind is set on the bridge, and she assures me that—judging by our egress point—we are not far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my instinct to put my hands out in front of me to feel my way through a completely unfamiliar place in total darkness, I soon find myself walking with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the entire ship rumbles and shakes, as if it were the growling stomach of a creature with a ravenous appetite that had been starved for many long years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadows draped themselves over the corridor through a thick haze of smoke and mist, settling into the half-formed image of bulbous pustules and fleshy growths. A rippling, writhing sea of skin poured out of the door behind me, transforming the corridor into a gullet. I looked up and saw several Forerunners trapped within, their silver-grey armor a stark contrast against the sickened flesh drawing them into the wall and ceiling as if to slowly digest them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are nothing, you and I. Nothing more than food.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This shall be the fate of all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two figures sprinted down the corridor, the Shaping Sickness closing in around them like a contracting muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was unmistakably Forerunner, clad in the strange all-encompassing armor with its single cyclopean eye. The other, I believe, was her, as these are surely her memories being played out—captured, interrogated, and disbelieved… now suddenly freed from the constraint field and holding a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forerunner spins around unbelievably fast, its right arm reconfigures into a rifle that fires precise rounds of ionized particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the Forerunner, she is noticeably shorter—perhaps just under seven feet tall without her helmet. As she fires light mass ammunition from her own borrowed weapon, I catch only a few glimpses of her features. She is broad and strong with wide-set shoulders, leaving no doubt that she is a warrior. How remarkably like us our Ancestors were, yet with far greater morphological variation. With a slightly rounder and elongated head bearing wider-set features, her chin is approximately an inch shorter than the average for modern &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, andwith a more pronounced dental arch. She appears closest perhaps to Denisovans, an extinct archaic subspecies in our time but vibrant and thriving in theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I long to speak with her properly, to offer some kind of comfort. How agonizing and dysphoric it must feel to see herself as she was in these wretched and dire dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know her name… she might have forgotten it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only comfort I can offer is to see out her desires to the end. She wishes to reach the bridge of this ship; she wishes for me to see these visions of long ago, though I do not yet grasp their full meaning, if they have one. The Flood—what she calls the Shaping Sickness—has already been encountered in our time. Perhaps she fears they will prove a resurgent threat once again. Or maybe the trauma of her experience is so great that the last scatterings of her reforming consciousness are simply compelled to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the two figures faded, I reach the end of the corridor and begin to climb up a side-mounted ladder that would bring us to an antechamber before the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is shockingly difficult to climb, my reserves of physical strength rapidly dwindling to nothing as I struggle up each rung. It has been many hours now since I last ate anything, and my throat is dry to the point of soreness. But there is no going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no lights to make out how much further I have to climb. My vision only allows me to see the next few rungs above me, but I am sure that it is getting colder—that more open air is not far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep my mind trained on all that I have learned. I am curious about her mission, and feeling her momentarily rescind in my mind only makes me want to know more. I am only human, after all—though we are over a hundred millennia removed from each other, curiosity is a trait she understands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it is a trait she would not now seek to avoid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arms shuddering in effort, I stop my climb, slumping against the metal as I refuse to go further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an odd thing, to try to bargain with her, to coax an answer out of this wisp of a dream or memory. And when at last she relents, it is with my own lips that she answers, the words spoken into the ENOCH apparatus around my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have come this far, let there be no secrets between us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than explain further, she conjures concepts and images from our shared subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great wave surges over an ocean, reaching higher and higher until it crashes down upon a city. This was happening everywhere, across whole planets—an inescapable deluge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent history then surfaces: human and alien hands are shaken—a peace accord is struck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sphinx then appears. It bears a human head, the wings of a bird, the body of a lion, and the tail of a snake, but before it can ask a question it is transformed. Its head is drawn wide and flat as the face is burned away to reveal the skull beneath. The wings of the bird expand as if to take flight, then separate into segmented fractal parts; the lion’s haunches curl inwards, the serpent tail extends, and all turns into cold and dark alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energy builds at its center, then is destructively released, laying low the ruins of the city as the waters continue to climb towards the sphinx’s tail…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She offers no further explanation, but I believe I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a test. This was some kind of staged infiltration mission to determine the Forerunners’ reaction to the bare truth of the Shaping Sickness, baiting the parasite to them so they could see it first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfied with her answer, I resumed my climb and did not stop until I reached the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;colder up here. Staggering around the space, I found myself in some kind of antechamber, a room connected to several others. I wonder how the Ancestors’ vessel layouts might echo our own, or if they built their ships in completely different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But motes of light began to appear once more, and I knew that this was—at least for now—the final dream she had to show me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immense support beam had collapsed on the Forerunner. And though he fired his weapon at the dark shades approaching from a hundred meters away, they did not relent—these shambling abominations sensing that their prey had been backed into a corner. If anything, they seemed to slow their advance, as if to savor the fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own weapon was spent, useful as nothing more than a cudgel. And though I looked frantically for a way out, no path presented itself to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stench was upon us now, the retching stink of blood and corpses hideously reshaped. Their heads lolled, necks had been disconnected from their spines, but the features of their faces were still recognizable—eternally frozen masks of horror and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forerunner was still firing his weapon, still trying to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, not a moment later, we both heard it. The trigger mechanism making a pronounced &lt;em&gt;click, click, click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He too was out of ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the monstrous form of his commander shuffle forwards. Slow. Terrible. Inevitable. One of his hands had been fused into the flesh of his stomach and a number of short, curved tendrils adorned his head like a sinewy crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It knelt down in front of the Forerunner, placing an immense gnarled hand upon him…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I... I cannot describe what happened to him next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is beyond both my will and ability to recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the last thing the Forerunner saw was me… but whether he was confused or in some way vindicated, I will never know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot deny that in the end his accusations seemed as if they were correct. The parasite had taken his entire crew, consumed everybody in this place, spared &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of his kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no more dreams for a while. She arrived at the shore, showed me—no, imparted within me—something that had long been forgotten, which she had determined must be remembered, and now she returns to the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of dreamer can I be without dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she showed me cannot remain a dream, it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be real. I am real, and I am to serve as a vessel for her pain, because that makes her real too. This I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I must temper this pain with hope, for there is one last thing for me to see. Something more tangible than a memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have reached the bridge of the vessel now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weary though I am, I find myself on the lower level where several rows of terminals, monitors, and interface consoles are arranged. There is a table at the center, about ten meters long and three meters wide, and a dozen more terminals around it for what must have been a variety of different stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She guides me towards the long table and moves my lips to form clicks and whistles. An activation signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment, everything remains cold and silent and still. There is just the labored sound of my breathing, echoing in this frigid tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is all too far gone…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that I hear a low hum emanating from the table a split second before a holograph sputters to life. Fractal formations of light fizz and buzz, attempting to resolve into coherent images as if they have forgotten how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the rising swell of excitement and joy, both hers and my own joined in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the holographs take their intended form and resolve in a series of square-shaped boards with a variety of symbols and readouts, exploding outwards to fill the room. I look up to see a display of the local star system showing the orbital paths of three small planets and a dense asteroid field, as well as the &lt;em&gt;Anlace&lt;/em&gt;-class frigate that delivered us to the system where this Ancestor vessel was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She moves my arms, raising them as if to begin conducting a symphony, and pulls the hologram back, expanding the view to other local star systems, then the Orion Arm, before settling on a yet more expansive view of spaces beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s when I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though our ancient Ancestors lost their war against the Forerunners and were subsequently punished with genetic reversion to a preindustrial state, the empire annihilated, and much evidence of our space-faring ages razed, there were many places that the Forerunners did not know of. Places they either could not or would not reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our advantage lay in &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; we had expanded towards. Escaping the shadowed reach of their ecumene led us to the farthest systems of this part of the galaxy, pushing beyond the Perseus Arm and ever more towards the borders of intergalactic space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forerunners feared to tread there. It is as if some long-suppressed dread lives within their own genetic memory from ages past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take longer than my remaining years to rediscover it all, but my goodness… there is so, &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more of us out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than I ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We carry their spark—every one of us. A fragment of another time, of other minds, just waiting to be dredged from the deep. One day, we might know them as we were meant to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, they will reach the shore, and all shall sing once more the mantra of the broken wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Halo Waypoint</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:36:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXkFVX3lxTE9UWm4xcWdXa2JnX1NkNWdOend1SUdLQjZJRmxjY2lwbzVWMlNneXBVbzZucVhONkZ1c1ZsZjZjZ3pjR2FLTUJWaHdRd3hZWDRvbWJVSWduWUNRenRmcUE</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. suggests some vaccines are risky or ineffective, downplays measles threat - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPLWlKNTNhVGNpbUh1LTk2UG1kMm9HcDV0YlJwaDZwWnpieE5zSjRERWZzd19ENTJTRldBWF9vTU80Tmd3MGFNMEJ2dU80VUhyUlpvckExaDdZV1dMWWRFTDQ4bjZnT1RaQWlFSHFFT1BTRHJSV09FTFhnUW5BNXk2X29pdDU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;growing outbreak of measles&lt;/a&gt; that could test his leadership, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week is sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of some vaccines — beyond the measles shot — and arguing the government shouldn’t mandate their use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also raised questions about what killed an 8-year-old girl whose death was attributed to measles by health officials, his latest remarks that downplay the threat of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/rfk-jr-says-people-should-get-the-measles-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that aired Wednesday, the nation’s top health official said that “people should get the measles vaccine,” a more direct assertion than has been typical from Kennedy, who has a long history of questioning vaccine safety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, however, he appeared to minimize the threat of a growing outbreak centered in Texas and New Mexico and sent mixed signals about vaccines, saying many vaccines “aren’t safety tested.” He went on to argue they’re not tested against placebo groups or only over short periods of time. Public health officials across independent bodies have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;repeatedly approved vaccines based on their safety and efficacy evidence&lt;/a&gt;, including placebo-controlled trials and long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I say they’re not safety tested, what I mean is that they’re not adequately [tested],” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy again downplayed the outbreak in a cabinet meeting with President Trump on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic as you’ve asked us to,” he said to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He praised the administration’s handling of the disease, which he said had crept up to about 680 cases across 22 states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The CDC has done an amazing job of getting the measles outbreak under control,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On CBS News, Kennedy also suggested that shots known as single-antigen vaccines do not work in the case of respiratory pathogens. Many vaccines, including all the licensed Covid-19 shots, are single-antigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview took place after Kennedy attended the funeral of an 8-year-old in West Texas, who died of measles, according to state health officials. In the CBS News interview, Kennedy suggested that, after talking with the girl’s family and reviewing her medical charts, other diseases caused her death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jon LaPook, the CBS News medical correspondent and physician who interviewed Kennedy, corrected him, saying most individuals who die from the measles ultimately die because of complications &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;related to the disease&lt;/a&gt;, such as a secondary infection that can grow deadly because of the damage measles has done to the body. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials described the two children who died from measles in this outbreak as “previously healthy.” Little is known about the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;adult in New Mexico with measles who also died&lt;/a&gt;. All three were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic reported Kennedy didn’t mention vaccines when visiting the family of the girl who died most recently. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/rfk-measles-grieving-families-texas/682386/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The father of the girl told The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;: “He never said anything about the vaccine being helpful.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“He said, ‘You don’t know what’s in the vaccine anymore,’” the girl’s father, Peter Hildebrand, told the publication. “I actually asked him about it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The measles case numbers reported by the CDC are believed to be &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/12/measles-outbreak-larger-than-reported-public-health-experts-say/"&gt;significant underestimates&lt;/a&gt;, with some parents avoiding testing for their children. More than 10% of those cases led to hospitalization, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the health secretary has downplayed the seriousness of the disease in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s only three deaths from measles in 20 years,” Kennedy told CBS News. “They’re all people with extreme complications.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/aside&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;There have been three deaths so far this year, and four in the last 20 years. The fact that the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;number of deaths so far in 2025&lt;/a&gt; equals the number that were recorded in the previous 24 years has infectious diseases experts concerned the country is now on a path to larger measles outbreaks and more frequent measles deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mixed messaging from the nation’s top health official — about whether measles is a significant threat or the vaccine is safe — are in sharp contrast with the messaging of public health experts and physicians, who fear the effects of Kennedy’s statements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not the way to inform people about vaccination,” Tom Frieden, a physician, former CDC director, and president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, said in an interview with STAT on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some anti-vaccine groups see in Kennedy’s statements an endorsement of their long-held views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re reading between the lines, are you?” Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization founded by Kennedy, recently &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1910143192181215270" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, along with a video of the HHS secretary saying he doesn’t think the vaccine should be mandated by the government. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the federal government doesn’t mandate vaccines, Frieden said, state rules that require vaccines before children go to schools are important to protecting against measles and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Parents who don’t vaccinate their child put other children, particularly those with a medical condition that makes them vulnerable, at risk,” Frieden said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The secretary has made state policies a key target for his agenda, meeting with state leaders this week on his &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/09/rfk-jr-maha-roadshow-plays-down-measles-plays-up-fluoride-removal-nutrition/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has changed a significant amount on the issue. He has previously framed the measles vaccine as dangerous and deadly, part of his work as an anti-vaccine advocate. Over the weekend, facing a second child dying in a growing outbreak, Kennedy said the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/rfk-jr-measles-statement-west-texas-outbreak/"&gt;is the best tool&lt;/a&gt; available to fight the outbreak, which has now spread across several states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy later pointed to other tools to handle the outbreak — well outside of mainstream recommendations — as potential cures for children who get the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is something we shouldn’t fool around with,” Frieden said. “Measles spreads like wildfire.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the CBS News interview, Kennedy was asked about the rationale behind a recent and&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/top-trump-fda-official-brenner-hits-pause-on-novavax-vaccine-decision-00266623" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; controversial decision by political staff at the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to delay approval of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, which is still being used under emergency use authorization. Kennedy said “it is a single antigen vaccine. And, for respiratory illnesses, the single antigen vaccines have never worked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(An antigen refers to the component of a vaccine that induces an immune response. Some vaccines target multiple parts of the pathogen they are designed to protect against, others focus on a single part, as is the case with Covid vaccines. They are designed to induce antibodies to the spike protein on the exterior of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In interviews with STAT, experts dismissed Kennedy’s claim. Peter Marks, the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/29/peter-marks-vaccine-regulator-fda-cber-biologics-biotech-reaction/"&gt;recently ousted&lt;/a&gt; head of the FDA’s biologics division, which regulates vaccines, said there are multiple effective vaccines for respiratory pathogens that target a single antigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helen Branswell contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The symptoms appeared from nowhere at the end of summer in 1989: his eyes started streaming, his throat was tight and he could not stop sneezing.

And the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I had never had these symptoms before.

Transported to Europe from &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/964792" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;North America in the 1800s&lt;/a&gt;, the invasive species has become widespread in parts of central and eastern Europe. The weed is highly allergenic: a single plant produces millions of tiny grains of airborne pollen and for some asthma sufferers, exposure can be life-threatening. In the US, &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-pollen/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost 50 million people are affected&lt;/a&gt; by common ragweed each year, extending the allergy season into early November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After the diagnosis, Makra switched the focus of his research to how rising temperatures impact pollen. Now 73, the University of Szeged professor has become a leading international expert on the subject, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30904111/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;co-authoring studies that show&lt;/a&gt; the pollen season is becoming longer and more severe in many places around the world as temperatures increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ed034d9e-c1da-4d0a-9b09-2defbdf413c2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Common ragweed, an invasive plant introduced to Europe in the 19th century, is highly allergenic.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-02318-8_3#Fig1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;there is a clear rise&lt;/a&gt; in the number of people reporting hay fever symptoms each year – part of a global surge in allergies – the reasons behind it are complicated and not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pollution, rising temperatures, increasing thunderstorms and the spread of invasive species are all transforming the world of pollen, with consequences that vary from place to place and year to year. In turn, these changes are having complex, varied effects on the human body – with sometimes deadly or debilitating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="thunderstorm-asthma" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Thunderstorm asthma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In November 2016 in Melbourne, emergency departments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393512301558X" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;saw a wave of thousands of admissions&lt;/a&gt; after a thunderstorm during peak pollen season, resulting in at least nine deaths and dozens of people in intensive care.

The combination of plunging temperatures, rising humidity and a high pollen count drove the rare weather event, which has also been &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749%2817%2930425-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recorded in London, Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and Naples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="17d70a03-2e22-47ca-8f14-f1f7e9724c9a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jaxon Dowal with his father, Chris Dowal, at Sunshine hospital in Melbourne, Australia.

These “asthma epidemics” have &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749%2817%2930425-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;only been recorded&lt;/a&gt; during pollen and outdoor mould seasons. Exactly how storms trigger the attacks is not clear, but scientists have proposed it is a combination of wind blowing more pollen into the air, and moisture in the atmosphere &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PII0140-6736(92)90864-Y/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;breaking pollen particles into smaller pieces&lt;/a&gt; – so they can penetrate more deeply into airways. As more moisture builds up in the atmosphere due to global heating, thunderstorms are becoming more common and intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pollution" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Pollution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the 1960s, scientists say more than 350,000 chemical molecules have been introduced into everyday life, many of which are harmful pollutants. They are interacting with pollen and the human body to make hay fever worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;First, particulate pollution from cars and industry is interacting with pollen, causing it to produce more allergens. &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279826" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One study of birch pollen in Poland&lt;/a&gt;, which affects about a &lt;a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/for-healthcare-professionals/birch-pollen-hcp/#:~:text=Birch%20pollen%20allergy%20is%20thought,to%20certain%20plant%20based%20foods)." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;quarter of UK hay fever sufferers&lt;/a&gt;, found that pollen in polluted areas had higher levels of a key allergen: Bet v1. The results of this effect are being seen in symptom surveys. A 2023 study by scientists at the University of Manchester found that people living in towns and cities reported &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30027-x.epdf?sharing_token=jxoKBzZLBmIsXjOyE3g4YdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NmwtZ1gLWxrzsd0_Re6UpJi4qJEm0o9BsKc9QATHn7oE6JGOYZZgZa5tZMNbYICjkMLwo6fQuY7YNKAugFVyiMRR3mt07yD_dwWOR9F5Cuq-6yWs5GZjIpzUKFa6gw32w%3D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;significantly more severe hay fever symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, indicating a potential relationship with urban pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next, researchers theorise that modern chemicals and pollutants are damaging the protective layers in our skin and mucus, making them “leaky” and therefore more exposed to allergens. Known as the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00538-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“epithelial barrier hypothesis”&lt;/a&gt;, experts say this is one of the factors behind the growth in people suffering with pollen allergies as well as sensitivities to food and autoimmune conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8d9cf80d-3b1a-4d2d-af36-94868e0db8a5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A haze obscures landmarks in London during a high air pollution warning in March 2022.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Claudia Traidl-Hoffmann at the Institute of Environmental Medicine and Integrative Health, University hospital Augsburg in Germany, says: “Our epithelial cells – that perform as a protective barrier on our skin and organs – are constantly being attacked by chemicals in the modern era: ultra fine particles, carbon particles, volatile organic compounds, chemicals in water, clothing, in our nutrition. They are all acting on our bodies, our gut, our oesophagus. The nearer a child lives to a high-traffic road, the higher the probability a child develops asthma and allergies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Contact with animals – particularly cows and dogs – is known to help prevent the development of allergies, Traidl-Hoffmann says, as does a diet varied in plants for young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="climate-breakdown" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Climate breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In many countries, the hay fever season is starting earlier, lasting longer and producing higher pollen loads – and there are predictions that rising temperatures will cause &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33771862/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a major increase in severity&lt;/a&gt; over time.

A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30904111/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found that from Iceland to Canada, several locations in the northern hemisphere are seeing rises in the cumulative pollen released by plants as they benefit from higher CO&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels and warmer temperatures. In the US, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.32124" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a recent review&lt;/a&gt; found a similar trend, with pollen production projected to increase by 16–40% by the end of the century. But this is not occurring everywhere and the changes are complicated and variable, with extreme heat and flooding sometimes decreasing pollen levels. In the UK, only about 30 pollens cause hay fever, with grass pollen the most common. Across Britain, there have been very modest changes in recent years in allergenic pollen, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722019751" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;say researchers&lt;/a&gt;.

So, for example, if you look at common ragweed, which is a progenitor for pollen in the fall, it’s now showing up in places in Norway and Sweden, and other places where it has not been seen previously. The winters are getting milder, and with milder winters, we typically have spring … happening earlier in the year, and then the fall happening later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="invasive-species" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Invasive species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some parts of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, there is growing recognition of the public health risks from invasive species with allergenic pollen. In Switzerland, leaf beetles that eat common ragweed have been introduced from North America to counteract the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the plant has already infested several regions in Europe, particularly Hungary, the Balkans, southern France and north-west Italy, with an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52367688" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated 13.5 million Europeans suffering&lt;/a&gt; from allergic reactions to it, resulting in €7.4bn (£6.3bn) worth of health costs a year. With ragweed pollen concentrations &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2652" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;projected to quadruple&lt;/a&gt; by the middle of the century, this could add more to the economic burden from hay fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fe6df042-1642-4075-9190-7f34db854db7" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Common ragweed plants are cleared in France to reduce their impact on allergy sufferers.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers say that as the climate changes, so too will the community of plants around the world, with resulting consequences for pollen. But exactly what that will look like is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In environmental medicine, it is never only one factor causing something, but a mixture of metrics. It’s like a mosaic. We have a longer pollen season because of climate change. The pollen are more aggressive because of pollution and rising temperatures. Another factor is new pollen from invasive species,” says Traidl-Hoffmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My message is not to be afraid. Yes, climate change, is impacting on our health, especially allergies.

The influenza virus vector-based nasal spray vaccine platform was first developed during the COVID-19 pandemic but now may be valuable in the fight against bird flu, which is on the rise across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/bird-flu" target="_blank"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; was first detected in humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Since then, the virus has spread across the planet and mutated into multiple variants, some of which are able to cross between different species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this ability to mutate and spread has made it a top candidate for triggering the next human pandemic, especially since the significant rise in cases across US dairy farms beginning in early 2024. Since &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/over-20-million-us-chickens-killed-by-bird-flu-contributing-to-egg-price-rises-77639" target="_blank"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; last year, the disease has spread among cattle and other &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/bird-flu-kills-20-big-cats-at-sanctuary-in-washington-state-77405" target="_blank"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, and has even infected some &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/h5n1-bird-flu-spreading-silently-in-us-as-cdc-data-reveals-unknown-infections-in-vets-78052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic surveillance has found &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/first-severe-human-infection-of-bird-flu-virus-in-the-us-shows-signs-of-mutation-77410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mutations&lt;/a&gt; in H5N1 that have made it apt at infecting humans through their upper respiratory cells, and if these mutations continue then they could be become a series problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are fears that the continual evolution and accumulation of mutations for mammalian adaptation, or reassortment with seasonal influenza viruses, by the current avian H5N1 virus might increase the likelihood of human transmission and foster a new pandemic” Ying Liu, at the University of Hong Kong’s Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, and colleagues explain in their new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the need to prepare for a potential bird flu pandemic is urgent, with the US allocating &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/hhs-awards-590-million-moderna-develop-mrna-vaccines-against-pandemic-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;over $500 million&lt;/a&gt; to pharmaceutical companies for mRNA-based vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If bird flu does become more of an issue across the world, the most critical strategy for responding to it is the rapid deployment of safe and effective &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/finland-to-offer-bird-flu-vaccines-to-at-risk-groups-in-possible-world-first-move-74606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, just as we saw with the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current vaccines are valuable for &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/universal-flu-vaccine-could-enter-human-trials-in-1-3-years-after-more-positive-results-75653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;preventing severe disease&lt;/a&gt; and lower the chances of mortality, but they do not necessarily do a great job at curbing viral transmission. The reason for this is because intramuscular administration – being injected in the arm, for instance – creates strong systemic antibodies, but insufficient immunity in the upper respiratory tract. In addition, most vaccines also require &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/no-more-yearly-flu-shots-vaccine-mixed-from-80000-proteins-could-be-the-key-74040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;multiple doses&lt;/a&gt; to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/covid-19-vaccine-nasal-drops-could-stop-viral-transmission-75386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nasal&lt;/a&gt; spray, in contrast, can be offered as a single dose that could play a vital role in protecting individuals and controlling an outbreak as it offers &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antiviral-chewing-gum-made-of-beans-could-help-stop-spread-of-herpes-and-flu-78716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mucosal immunity&lt;/a&gt; at the site where the virus enters the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to address this, Liu and colleagues based at the University of Hong Kong's InnoHK Center for Virology, Vaccinology and Therapeutics (CVVT) used the influenza virus vector-based nasal spray vaccine platform to produce a nasal spray for bird flu. So far, animal studies have confirmed its safety profile and ability to produce comprehensive immunity – including neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses, and mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it seems one dose is enough to provide strong protection against infection, sustaining immune memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If further clinical trials are successful then this vaccine could be positioned as a critical reserve for &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-concerned-do-we-need-to-be-about-bird-flu-in-the-us-77916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;future H5N1 outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, which would drastically shorten development timelines. The vaccine’s nasal delivery mechanism could also curb viral transmission early in an &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/exercise-polaris-the-who-just-ran-a-2-day-pandemic-preparedness-exercise-78708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58504-z" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 15:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcmtuZGljZWUxRU4ySjFVX1h0QlVNNWFGTFJVQkRsS2pHWDk0VVhJcVdNN1IwZEZHaG1ydDU1eHQwOHk1Qkc4VDU1OGRmaVh3ZnFBNXEwN1BKZUx2NUkzLWxUMDJwWFE3OFZmOE1hbHdYZEtKSFFQNWN3UjAxY2ZIVFFkbERtRGlzaFhqNXU2SGZEMlRyWW5CaENuQXJiR3pJLU5JcG1CdEQ0eWRf</guid></item><item><title>People with ADHD symptoms report more involuntary memories in daily life - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNQThzUktETmp1LWI5NXBpWTYyRmppSXlGaVItNDNYc3pkcVpSaVg4bkVhbkJ0b05MVmlJY09pcWpYWjJ4ZUd1ay15dm1yYTRuNEhuRGFlUHRTT3BHQXRQR05tWFFSZ0RTeHZacVVKTklmbjFweFVVT1lJakZKMlZReDJlQUsyVmxkM25BNm1xeFMxV1F2UEZJdmJCdnBIUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12749" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;British Journal of Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that individuals who report symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder tend to experience more involuntary memories in everyday life than those without such symptoms. These spontaneous recollections were also rated as less positive and more repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore whether spontaneous remembering—unintended recollections of personal experiences—might be more frequent among people with ADHD traits. While past research has established a connection between ADHD and increased mind wandering, it was unclear whether this tendency also extended to involuntary memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had produced mixed results. Some naturalistic studies hinted at a link between distractibility and spontaneous remembering, while others using laboratory-based measures found no such association. The authors of the current study suspected that traditional lab tasks might fail to detect real-life differences and designed two complementary studies to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 453 undergraduate participants completed the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale (BAARS-IV), a validated questionnaire used to identify symptoms of ADHD. Based on their scores, participants were grouped into those who scored within the ADHD range and those who did not. All participants then took part in a vigilance task, which was designed to measure spontaneous thoughts and memories in a controlled setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this task, participants viewed a sequence of slides and were asked to report any unplanned memories or thoughts they experienced. After the task, they completed a separate questionnaire asking them to estimate how often they experienced involuntary memories in their daily lives, how emotionally positive or negative these memories tended to be, and how often the same memories repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this first study showed no difference in the number of spontaneous memories reported during the laboratory task between those with ADHD symptoms and those without. However, the questionnaire responses painted a different picture. Participants who scored in the ADHD range estimated that they experienced significantly more involuntary memories in their daily lives compared to the other groups. They also described these memories as being less positive and more repetitive. These findings suggest that while laboratory settings may not always detect variations in spontaneous memory experiences, self-reported everyday experiences can reveal meaningful differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on these findings, the researchers conducted a second study using a more naturalistic method. A new sample of 116 participants, including both students and community members, also completed the BAARS-IV. They were then asked to carry a pocket-sized diary for 48 hours and record every involuntary memory they experienced during that time. For each memory, they noted the time, their age in the memory, and rated its emotional tone, emotional impact, how often the memory had occurred before, and how focused their attention was at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diary-based study provided additional support for the researchers’ expectations. Participants with ADHD-range scores recorded significantly more involuntary memories over the 48-hour period than those in the non-ADHD range. On average, they reported nearly twice as many memories. As in the first study, they also rated their memories as less emotionally positive. However, unlike the questionnaire results, there were no significant group differences in how repetitive the memories were or in attention levels reported at the time the memories occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings indicate that people with ADHD symptoms may experience more frequent spontaneous memories than others, particularly in their day-to-day lives. The difference was not apparent during a controlled laboratory task, which the researchers believe may not reflect real-world attention dynamics. In fact, they propose that the vigilance task, which includes meaningful word phrases, may actually help participants with ADHD maintain their focus, suppressing spontaneous memories that would otherwise occur in less structured settings. Alternatively, the task may have artificially elevated the rate of spontaneous memories in non-ADHD participants, masking any differences between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diary method, in contrast, offered a more natural glimpse into how often these memories arise in ordinary circumstances. Since participants were recording experiences in real time as they went about their daily lives, this method may better reflect genuine cognitive differences between people with and without ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged several limitations in their work. First, the participants were not formally diagnosed with ADHD, but rather scored in the ADHD range on a self-report scale. While this method is commonly used in psychological research, future studies with clinically diagnosed samples would help confirm the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also relied on self-report measures, which can be vulnerable to inaccuracies. For instance, people with ADHD may over- or underestimate how often they experience repetitive memories. Although the diary method helps address some of these concerns, it too has limitations. Participants may have forgotten to record some memories, especially if they occurred frequently, which could lead to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that people with ADHD symptoms tend to experience more spontaneous cognitive events, including not only future-oriented mind wandering but also unintentional recollections of past experiences. These findings could help researchers better understand how attention and memory interact in people with attentional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that future research could use longer diary recording periods to capture patterns that might not appear over just two days. They also recommend further investigation into why these differences arise. While one theory holds that people with ADHD have weaker mechanisms for filtering out irrelevant memories, the evidence for this remains inconclusive. More research is needed to clarify what drives these differences in spontaneous remembering and how they affect daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12749" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Involuntary remembering and ADHD: Do individuals with ADHD symptoms experience high volumes of involuntary memories in everyday life?&lt;/a&gt;“, was authored by John H.

From sprinkling it over your morning oatmeal to using it in holiday desserts, it’s easy to see why this spice has become a staple in kitchens worldwide. Besides elevating your favorite dishes, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/279482/4-super-spices-health-benefits-of-ginger-cinnamon-and-more/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cinnamon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; can have meaningful effects on your health, some of which may not be ideal if you’re taking certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take prescription medications, it’s important to be aware of how cinnamon might interact with your meds and talk to a doctor about whether this warming spice is safe for you to consume. Here, experts explain four key ways cinnamon can interact with medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. It May Affect Blood Sugar Levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cinnamon may lower blood sugar, which can interact with blood sugar-lowering medications like insulin and metformin,” says &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Whitney Stuart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Whitney Stuart&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based registered dietitian. Specifically, cinnamon contains compounds, like cinnamaldehyde, that may enhance insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production in the liver. When combined with certain diabetes medications, this could cause blood sugar levels to drop too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not need to avoid cinnamon completely—in fact, cinnamon may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. However, if you’re taking blood sugar-lowering medications, it’s important to talk with your endocrinologist or other health care provider about if and how much cinnamon is safe to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. It May Impact Blood Coagulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon may also interfere with the effectiveness of anticoagulant medications, thanks to the presence of coumarin, a naturally occurring compound found in cinnamon. “Coumarin can affect liver enzymes that help break down medications, particularly those in the cytochrome P450 family,” says &lt;a href="https://www.amwa-doc.org/speakers-bureau/gail-l-clifford-md-mmm-cpe-facp-fhm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gail Clifford, M.D., M.M.M., CPE, FACP, FHM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gail Clifford, M.D., M.M.M., CPE, FACP, FHM&lt;/a&gt;, a medical consultant at ARRC LED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One medication that stands out here is warfarin, a common blood thinner,” Clifford adds. “If cinnamon interferes with the enzymes that metabolize warfarin, it can lead to more of the drug staying in your system than intended. That raises the risk of severe bleeding.” What’s more, Clifford explains that cinnamon has mild blood-thinning properties, which, when combined with the effects of coumarin, further increases its potential to affect these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051448/different-types-of-cinnamon/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:types of cinnamon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;types of cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; contain coumarin, cassia cinnamon has been found to have higher levels than Ceylon cinnamon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. It May Impact Liver Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides affecting blood coagulation, coumarin found in cinnamon may be harmful to the liver when consumed in excess. While likely not a concern for most healthy adults, this may pose a risk for folks taking medications metabolized by the liver, such as acetaminophen (like Tylenol), statins or anti-seizure drugs. People with preexisting liver conditions, such as fatty liver disease or hepatitis, are also vulnerable to these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. It May Lower Blood Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain compounds in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, may have a mild effect on lowering blood pressure. While this may be beneficial for some, it poses a risk for folks taking blood pressure-lowering medications, like beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. When combined with one of these medications, cinnamon could cause your blood pressure to drop too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Precautions and Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking prescription medications, it’s essential to approach cinnamon consumption with care to avoid unintended side effects. This is especially true if you’re considering a cinnamon supplement. As Clifford warns, just because cinnamon supplements are natural, it doesn’t mean they’re safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize risks, talk with a health care professional about the safety of cinnamon and cinnamon supplements when taking prescription medications. “It’s essential for patients to disclose any herbal supplements or alternative remedies they may be using even if they seem not important,” per &lt;a href="https://cassioburycourt.com/about/meet-the-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ola Otulana, M.B.B.S., DRCOG;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ola Otulana, M.B.B.S., DRCOG&lt;/a&gt;, a general provider physician at Cassiobury Court. A health care expert can provide personalized advice based on your specific health needs, ensuring that it complements any ongoing treatment safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being known for its many health benefits, cinnamon may have unwanted side effects, especially if you’re taking prescription medications like blood thinners, certain diabetes medications or antihypertensive drugs. While rare, it may also lead to liver toxicity when combined with certain medications or taken by people with liver conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A sprinkle of cinnamon in your oatmeal is fine for most people,” says Clifford. However, she adds that if you’re taking a prescription medication or have a preexisting condition, it’s best to talk with a health care professional before introducing cinnamon supplements or substantial amounts of cinnamon into your diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-cinnamon-interacts-with-your-meds-11711435" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:34:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBDdGc2dFBTQ1FxSFVGMnZ6SnRwdTlkS1NtMXZwNmFmeWwyUHdHYVZNRTFxSDZJS1hzd2c3VS1vYk1BZVpsVndQd0pHVk9DSWRiNmljMWduNHFxNExDV2ZYUkRGRm9rcVVyUjYxa3BfWVI</guid></item><item><title>Heavy Drinking Linked to Brain Lesions and Cognitive Decline Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5pX3lsQlVlZ3pKOUN5YlpzNVg2LTZRdnR6OXBUeTJucURwOXN5b3VYalk5aDJRWWw2R094MnpfR1lXeHlNem5BalFTSUUteTE5dzREdjQtRTlfN1FFTnJFbTEybnZhWDZVTnJTUlh3R2M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Consuming eight or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with brain lesions known as hyaline arteriolosclerosis, which can impair memory and thinking. These lesions are signs of damaged blood vessels that restrict blood flow and gradually harm brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that heavy and former heavy drinkers had higher odds of tau tangles, a biomarker linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Former drinkers showed reduced brain mass and worse cognitive performance, and heavy drinkers died, on average, 13 years earlier than non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesion Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy drinkers had 133% higher odds of brain lesions than non-drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Tau tangles were more likely in heavy and former heavy drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifespan Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy drinkers died 13 years earlier than non-drinkers, on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy drinkers who have eight or more alcoholic drinks per week have an increased risk of brain lesions called hyaline arteriolosclerosis, signs of brain injury that are associated with memory and thinking problems, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study does not prove that heavy drinking causes brain injury; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is a condition that causes the small blood vessels to narrow, becoming thick and stiff. This makes it harder for blood to flow, which can damage the brain over time. It appears as lesions, areas of damaged tissue in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108567"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads, brains and a glass." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Justo noted that, in addition to brain injuries, impaired cognitive abilities were observed only in former drinkers. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heavy alcohol consumption is a major global health concern linked to increased health problems and death,” said study author Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo, PhD, of University of Sao Paulo Medical School in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We looked at how alcohol affects the brain as people get older. Our research shows that heavy alcohol consumption is damaging to the brain, which can lead to memory and thinking problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 1,781 people who had an average age of 75 at death. All had brain autopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined brain tissue to look for signs of brain injury including tau tangles and hyaline arteriolosclerosis. They also measured brain weight and the height of each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family members answered questions about participants’ alcohol consumption.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then divided the participants into four groups: 965 people who never drank, 319 moderate drinkers who had seven or fewer drinks per week; 129 heavy drinkers who had eight or more drinks per week; and 368 former heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers defined one drink as having 14 grams of alcohol, which is about 350 milliliters (ml) of beer, 150 ml of wine or 45 ml of distilled spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those who never drank, 40% had vascular brain lesions. Of the moderate drinkers, 45% had vascular brain lesions. Of the heavy drinkers, 44% had vascular brain lesions. Of the former heavy drinkers, 50% had vascular brain lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for factors that could affect brain health such as age at death, smoking and physical activity, heavy drinkers had 133% higher odds of having vascular brain lesions compared to those who never drank, former heavy drinkers had 89% higher odds and moderate drinkers, 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found heavy and former heavy drinkers had higher odds of developing tau tangles, a biomarker associated with Alzheimer’s disease, with 41% and 31% higher odds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former heavy drinking was associated with a lower brain mass ratio, a smaller proportion of brain mass compared to body mass, and worse cognitive abilities. No link was found between moderate or heavy drinking and brain mass ratio or cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justo noted that, in addition to brain injuries, impaired cognitive abilities were observed only in former drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that heavy drinkers died an average of 13 years earlier than those who never drank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found heavy drinking is directly linked to signs of injury in the brain, and this can cause long-term effects on brain health, which may impact memory and thinking abilities,” said Justo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding these effects is crucial for public health awareness and continuing to implement preventive measures to reduce heavy drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that it did not look at participants before death and did not have information on the duration of alcohol consumption and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by The São Paulo Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AUD and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f515c50514d5e5b7f5e5e51115c5052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:17:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5pX3lsQlVlZ3pKOUN5YlpzNVg2LTZRdnR6OXBUeTJucURwOXN5b3VYalk5aDJRWWw2R094MnpfR1lXeHlNem5BalFTSUUteTE5dzREdjQtRTlfN1FFTnJFbTEybnZhWDZVTnJTUlh3R2M</guid></item><item><title>Dopamine changes from cannabis are linked to psychosis - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPRHJqbWNBY0Y5d2ZmelJmdEdLREYxUWtndng2NmJvNENVUy13ek5rb09sb1JJTG5NcWo5OUYwa24tX1Vscl9BYkRzbEJKRE03WDEyRnlYbHR1UGp3NFBWaHBjVVdQRjBlUmFleHR0WjNtbEwyRGJaV0VWSDlKYzUtdk9iY2FvNHBC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years after cannabis legalization in Canada, scientists are still mapping its long-term health effects. While social and medical benefits remain under review, emerging neuroscience now highlights a key concern – psychosis linked to dopamine changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by Canadian researchers has found biological evidence linking frequent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-cannabis-helped-patients-feel-better-for-a-full-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; to changes in brain chemistry that resemble those seen in early psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a cutting-edge brain scan called neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the experts observed elevated dopamine activity in people with cannabis use disorder (CUD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase occurred in the same brain areas previously tied to hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms of psychotic disorders. The findings appeared in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, in a study titled “&lt;em&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, spanning five years and several institutions, marks a turning point in how clinicians and researchers understand cannabis’ psychiatric risks. The analysis bridges the gap between clinical symptoms and underlying brain activity – something long sought but rarely demonstrated so clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-builds-dopamine-in-key-brain-areas"&gt;Cannabis builds dopamine in key brain areas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine helps the brain regulate mood, motivation, learning, and motor control. It also plays a central role in psychosis. High dopamine activity, especially in the striatum and midbrain, has been linked to schizophrenia and related disorders. What remained uncertain was how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; fit into that picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used neuromelanin-MRI – a non-invasive method that visualizes dopamine activity indirectly by tracking neuromelanin, a vital compound in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin is a dark pigment that accumulates as dopamine breaks down over time. The more dopamine activity, the more neuromelanin remains behind. In brain scans, this pigment shows up as darkened regions, especially in two key midbrain areas: the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people partaking in excess cannabis use, those spots are blacker than what they should be for their age compared to healthy individuals,” said Lena Palaniyappan, professor at McGill University and senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates they have high levels of dopamine, and in some cases are showing pigments someone 10 years older would have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-use-elevates-dopamine-signals"&gt;Cannabis use elevates dopamine signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was focused on 61 individuals aged 18 to 35 from London, Ontario. Participants included people with CUD, those with early psychosis, some with both conditions, and healthy controls. The researchers tracked changes in neuromelanin-MRI signals across the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that those with CUD – regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis – had elevated neuromelanin signals in a subregion of the midbrain tied to psychosis. This was not a temporary spike. Even after one year, the signal remained high, suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-related-anxiety-may-be-reduced-with-citrus-based-oil-d-limonene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;-related dopamine changes may have a lasting effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding was dose-dependent. Individuals with more severe CUD symptoms showed stronger signal intensity, confirming that frequency and severity of cannabis use matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have evidence that shows a straight line linking cannabis with dopamine and psychosis that has never been shown before, and it’s crucial that clinicians, patients, and families work together to break this line,” said Palaniyappan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-increases-the-risk-of-psychosis"&gt;Cannabis increases the risk of psychosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-impacts-working-memory-and-brain-function/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cannabis&lt;/a&gt;’ effects on dopamine have long been disputed. Previous PET scans often showed mixed results – some indicating lowered dopamine synthesis, others showing a spike only after THC administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI offers a longer-term view, revealing cumulative dopamine activity, not just momentary shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with CUD had consistently higher neuromelanin signal across multiple scans, even when researchers accounted for nicotine use and other variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) did not show significant changes unless they also had CUD, which suggests cannabis itself may play a more central role than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could help explain why cannabis use increases the risk of hallucinations and delusions, key symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,” said Jessica Ahrens, a PhD student at McGill University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-induced-psychosis-is-rising"&gt;Cannabis-induced psychosis is rising &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian emergency departments have reported more cases of cannabis-induced psychosis since legalization. Psychiatrists working with young adults are observing troubling patterns. Brief episodes are turning into more severe psychotic breaks over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the last several years since legalization, we’re seeing adolescents who have two or three brief cannabis-induced episodes of psychosis and then have a much more major episode,” said Dr. Julie Richard, psychiatrist and physician lead at PEPP, a specialized early psychosis program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re trying to counsel adolescents within that first episode that they’re pushing their brain towards a major episode and show them the areas in the brain that are impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new imaging data now offers a visual tool that can support those conversations. Showing young people their own brain scans could help clinicians explain the risks more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dopamine-changes-persist-after-one-year"&gt;Dopamine changes persist after one year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the experts found no evidence that continued cannabis use beyond a certain point further increased dopamine activity. This suggests that dopamine-related changes may plateau after repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, this stability does not mean the brain returns to normal. Elevated neuromelanin signals remained even a year later, indicating lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increased dopamine functioning in the SN/VTA may be associated with the risk of psychosis in people with cannabis use disorder,” the authors wrote. This midbrain region – the source of dopamine projections to other brain areas – appears central to how cannabis affects mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a “recovery effect” raises new questions: Can these changes be reversed with abstinence? Do they set the stage for future psychiatric illness? Larger, long-term studies will be needed to explore these questions further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-guiding-public-health-and-prevention"&gt;Guiding public health and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasized that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-potency-cannabis-use-linked-to-epigenetic-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; alone does not cause psychosis in every user. But it raises the risk, especially in those with family histories or early symptoms. By linking cannabis use to measurable brain changes, this study helps move the discussion from speculation to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use,” said Palaniyappan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope these findings lead patients and health-care providers to better understand the implications and for the health-care providers to give patients resources for options other than cannabis to help them cope,” Jessica Ahrens added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-and-dopamine-help-explain-psychosis"&gt;Cannabis and dopamine help explain psychosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does not aim to demonize cannabis but to understand its effects better. With its use becoming more socially accepted and legally accessible, especially among youth, understanding its neurological footprint is urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use disorder is now more than a behavioral diagnosis. It is increasingly linked to real, visible changes in the brain’s dopamine system that may shape vulnerability to psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, families, and users themselves, this information could lead to more informed decisions and safer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2832297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:08:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPRHJqbWNBY0Y5d2ZmelJmdEdLREYxUWtndng2NmJvNENVUy13ek5rb09sb1JJTG5NcWo5OUYwa24tX1Vscl9BYkRzbEJKRE03WDEyRnlYbHR1UGp3NFBWaHBjVVdQRjBlUmFleHR0WjNtbEwyRGJaV0VWSDlKYzUtdk9iY2FvNHBC</guid></item><item><title>10 small things neurologists wish you’d do for your brain - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLXNzbHhvWmc3MjZLNDFGMy10SllJbTloRkdOWjBHMWVHZ3cxMHlWbGtpQmFyUnlJZHRzbzN1d2huNUhrZGFidzZ2aWRCNl9JMDNOekZYRC1EY2h6aUpSYWVoVDBUTzQxY3poak9zV1B3QzBhTjFScE5MOVlVTDJOSXBuYmlCbnZvSlBMR2QtQWdKVWVEN1VmM1p6T2U5RkluV3hsX3YzNnpvUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLXNzbHhvWmc3MjZLNDFGMy10SllJbTloRkdOWjBHMWVHZ3cxMHlWbGtpQmFyUnlJZHRzbzN1d2huNUhrZGFidzZ2aWRCNl9JMDNOekZYRC1EY2h6aUpSYWVoVDBUTzQxY3poak9zV1B3QzBhTjFScE5MOVlVTDJOSXBuYmlCbnZvSlBMR2QtQWdKVWVEN1VmM1p6T2U5RkluV3hsX3YzNnpvUQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;10 small things neurologists wish you’d do for your brain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOQUFVNHFEM0tQMi1zU0dwNktqRGZadWJmQ3N4MlV3aEk1bEFCMWJ5TWloZHp1MUNoM29hYU9XNWl4Y1BlMXVQSlhLVU9nT2ktbm9IaDB0Qm5LQlN3bjBTanFmTExlczdPT1VPT0w5ZmlRRGJZclktRkFxd1NZTFZXSEV4dldCQdIBiwFBVV95cUxNUC1KaU9SdWlYMVhyaUNNNEpEMURtZnlVYVlrODktdE5GQU8yNEZUTkloaHNiLV9qTVIzQTlfc0FKRlgzcUlMQTd5eU5yczk0dHh1WE01WXpTY0FubTVMY3hvTTgxMzZ3UGNZc28wU1ZjTmhTcXNOQ21uV1E0U0pzaFJ5YWhUbTRsclJv?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Doctor says these fish and veg 'effective at combating dementia'&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 13:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLXNzbHhvWmc3MjZLNDFGMy10SllJbTloRkdOWjBHMWVHZ3cxMHlWbGtpQmFyUnlJZHRzbzN1d2huNUhrZGFidzZ2aWRCNl9JMDNOekZYRC1EY2h6aUpSYWVoVDBUTzQxY3poak9zV1B3QzBhTjFScE5MOVlVTDJOSXBuYmlCbnZvSlBMR2QtQWdKVWVEN1VmM1p6T2U5RkluV3hsX3YzNnpvUQ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover Unexpected Link Between Diet And Lung Cancer Risk - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOUVpXTDVPTHlSS3pyaW44RmVmT1ZSNFVadnloM0E1dHZpbWJzLVBYeUpodGhBbU8xVWNoM3F5RmJ3Z25KMXU0ck9LMTVGLTY1S3dHVFlwSVRpaF9EMnQ1TDcxWjd2emhGZVQ0U05HQ1dKd0RBWThKdnFCVVIzenVYR1VjQlB3NWhIaGFLbEhaRDdMT1d3amhRdWFyTV85T3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Most of us would probably &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-cigarette-steals-20-minutes-of-your-life-expectancy-study-finds"&gt;think of smoking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to lung  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157643" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk, but researchers have discovered an intriguing link between the disease and the quality of our diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from the University of Florida and the University of Kentucky, found that the molecule &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, which stores the simple sugar glucose, could potentially act as a driver of some types of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen was found at higher levels in human tissue samples of &lt;a href="https://www.lungevity.org/lung-cancer-basics/types-of-lung-cancer/lung-adenocarcinoma"&gt;lung adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt;, the type responsible for 40 percent of lung cancers worldwide. In tests on mice, the team found that more glycogen helped lung cancers to grow faster, while taking the molecule away led to restricted tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157646" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/LungImages.jpg" alt="Lung tissue image" class="wp-image-157646 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/LungImages.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/LungImages-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at glycogen levels in lung tissue. (Clarke et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study relies on a technique called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-023-00881-0"&gt;spatial metabolomics&lt;/a&gt;, which enables scientists to identify specific small molecule characteristics in the context of their location inside tissue. Here, the team used a platform designed for tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This platform offered a new lens through which to visualize diseases, enabling researchers to discern previously undiscovered molecular patterns and interactions with striking detail and depth of insight," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/eat-better-breathe-easier-research-points-to-link-between-diet-lung-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Ramon Sun, from the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have been looking at glycogen and its relationship to different types of cancer &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00109-015-1377-9"&gt;for some time&lt;/a&gt;. It appears this energy source can act like a sweet treat for cancer cells, giving it the fuel to grow fast enough to overwhelm our natural immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that glycogen &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-lose-more-than-fat-on-a-diet-and-the-consequences-are-serious"&gt;comes from the carbohydrates we eat&lt;/a&gt;, and is an important fuel reserve in our muscles that our bodies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-15-minutes-of-intense-activity-can-improve-heart-health"&gt;tap into when we exercise&lt;/a&gt;. It essentially stores glucose that isn't needed right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also something that builds up as a result of a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. In this study, mice that were fed this diet saw much higher levels of lung cancer growth than mice fed either high-fat, high-carb, or control diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research will be needed to confirm a link to diet and lung cancer in humans, but it seems there's an association of some kind here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, our approach to cancer prevention should mirror the success of the anti-smoking campaign – placing greater emphasis on public awareness and policy-driven strategies that promote healthier dietary choices as a fundamental component of disease prevention," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/eat-better-breathe-easier-research-points-to-link-between-diet-lung-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the higher glycogen levels were only noted in tissue samples of lung adenocarcinoma in humans, not in other types of lung cancer – such as &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung-a-to-z"&gt;lung squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that will need further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's a reminder of just how important our diets are when it comes to overall health. Just as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-diet-change-could-slash-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-in-men-study-finds"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-links-alcohol-to-six-major-cancer-types"&gt;alcoholic drinks&lt;/a&gt; are believed to contribute to risk levels for certain types of cancer, we may soon have to add lung cancer to the list of risks associated with the Western-style diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lung cancer has not traditionally been thought of as a dietary-related disease," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/eat-better-breathe-easier-research-points-to-link-between-diet-lung-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sun. "Diseases like pancreatic cancer or liver cancer, yes. However, when it comes to lung cancer, the idea that diet could play a role is rarely discussed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01243-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon is a favorite of many, cherished for its warm flavor and enticing aroma. From sprinkling it over your morning oatmeal to using it in holiday desserts, it’s easy to see why this spice has become a staple in kitchens worldwide. Besides elevating your favorite dishes, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/279482/4-super-spices-health-benefits-of-ginger-cinnamon-and-more/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; can have meaningful effects on your health, some of which may not be ideal if you’re taking certain medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you take prescription medications, it’s important to be aware of how cinnamon might interact with your meds and talk to a doctor about whether this warming spice is safe for you to consume. Here, experts explain four key ways cinnamon can interact with medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-it-may-affect-blood-sugar-levels"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. It May Affect Blood Sugar Levels  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cinnamon may lower blood sugar, which can interact with blood sugar-lowering medications like insulin and metformin,” says &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whitney Stuart&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based registered dietitian. Specifically, cinnamon contains compounds, like cinnamaldehyde, that may enhance insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production in the liver.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When combined with certain diabetes medications, this could cause blood sugar levels to drop too low.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not need to avoid cinnamon completely—in fact, cinnamon may be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you’re taking blood sugar-lowering medications, it’s important to talk with your endocrinologist or other health care provider about if and how much cinnamon is safe to consume. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-it-may-impact-blood-coagulation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. It May Impact Blood Coagulation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon may also interfere with the effectiveness of anticoagulant medications, thanks to the presence of coumarin, a naturally occurring compound found in cinnamon. “Coumarin can affect liver enzymes that help break down medications, particularly those in the cytochrome P450 family,” says &lt;a href="https://www.amwa-doc.org/speakers-bureau/gail-l-clifford-md-mmm-cpe-facp-fhm/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Gail Clifford, M.D., M.M.M., CPE, FACP, FHM&lt;/a&gt;, a medical consultant at ARRC LED.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One medication that stands out here is warfarin, a common blood thinner,” Clifford adds. “If cinnamon interferes with the enzymes that metabolize warfarin, it can lead to more of the drug staying in your system than intended. That raises the risk of severe bleeding.” What’s more, Clifford explains that cinnamon has mild blood-thinning properties, which, when combined with the effects of coumarin, further increases its potential to affect these medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051448/different-types-of-cinnamon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;types of cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; contain coumarin, cassia cinnamon has been found to have higher levels than Ceylon cinnamon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-it-may-impact-liver-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. It May Impact Liver Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides affecting blood coagulation, coumarin found in cinnamon may be harmful to the liver when consumed in excess.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While likely not a concern for most healthy adults, this may pose a risk for folks taking medications metabolized by the liver, such as acetaminophen (like Tylenol), statins or anti-seizure drugs. People with preexisting liver conditions, such as fatty liver disease or hepatitis, are also vulnerable to these effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-it-may-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. It May Lower Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain compounds in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, may have a mild effect on lowering blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While this may be beneficial for some, it poses a risk for folks taking blood pressure-lowering medications, like beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. When combined with one of these medications, cinnamon could cause your blood pressure to drop too low. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-precautions-and-recommendations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Precautions and Recommendations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re taking prescription medications, it’s essential to approach cinnamon consumption with care to avoid unintended side effects. This is especially true if you’re considering a cinnamon supplement. As Clifford warns, just because cinnamon supplements are natural, it doesn’t mean they’re safe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To minimize risks, talk with a health care professional about the safety of cinnamon and cinnamon supplements when taking prescription medications. “It’s essential for patients to disclose any herbal supplements or alternative remedies they may be using even if they seem not important,” per &lt;a href="https://cassioburycourt.com/about/meet-the-team/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ola Otulana, M.B.B.S., DRCOG&lt;/a&gt;, a general provider physician at Cassiobury Court. A health care expert can provide personalized advice based on your specific health needs, ensuring that it complements any ongoing treatment safely. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite being known for its many health benefits, cinnamon may have unwanted side effects, especially if you’re taking prescription medications like blood thinners, certain diabetes medications or antihypertensive drugs. While rare, it may also lead to liver toxicity when combined with certain medications or taken by people with liver conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A sprinkle of cinnamon in your oatmeal is fine for most people,” says Clifford. However, she adds that if you’re taking a prescription medication or have a preexisting condition, it’s best to talk with a health care professional before introducing cinnamon supplements or substantial amounts of cinnamon into your diet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using data from the UK Biobank, researchers identified five obesity trajectories and linked them to different levels of neurological deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with decreasing obesity showed minimal brain and cognitive decline, while high-stable and increasing patterns were tied to widespread brain damage. The findings suggest that chronic obesity may accelerate brain aging and emphasize the importance of early and sustained weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity Trajectories:&lt;/strong&gt; Five patterns—low-stable, moderate-stable, high-stable, increasing, and decreasing—were linked to different brain and cognitive outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Regions Affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Deterioration began in fronto-mesolimbic areas and spread to parietal and temporal regions with increasing obesity severity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversible Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with decreasing obesity showed minimal brain damage, highlighting the benefits of long-term weight control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PolyU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the global prevalence of obesity on the rise, it is crucial to explore the neural mechanisms linked to obesity and its influence on brain and cognitive health. However, the impact of obesity on the brain is complex and multilevel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, Prof. Anqi QIU, Professor of the Department of Health Technology and Informatics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Global STEM Scholar, has unveiled novel research to advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and its implications for cognitive health in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is implicated in brain and cognitive health, but the long-term impact of obesity trajectories on brain and cognitive aging remains insufficiently understood. Most existing research primarily relies on cross-sectional samples, making it difficult to distinguish between chronic and temporary obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether varying levels of obesity over time affect brain anatomy and function differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Prof. QIU’s research addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of obesity trajectories and their impacts on brain and cognitive health in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on multifaceted obesity measurements from the UK Biobank, the study identifies five distinct obesity trajectories: low-stable, moderate-stable, high-stable, increasing and decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the study examines how these obesity patterns influence brain morphology, function and cognition in middle-aged and older adults, offering deeper insights into their long-term neurological effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, individuals in the decreasing trajectory showed minimal adverse effects on brain structure and cognitive performance compared to those in the low-stable group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the increasing, moderate-stable, and high-stable trajectories were associated with progressively greater impairment in brain structure, functional connectivity, and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these adverse effects began in the fronto-mesolimbic regions for the increasing trajectory, extended to parietal and temporal regions in the moderate-stable group, and ultimately led to widespread brain abnormalities in the high-stable group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the dynamic relationship between obesity progression and brain-cognitive health, underscoring the clinical importance of long-term monitoring and management of obesity through a multifaceted approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reveals a distinct, progressive pattern of brain deterioration linked to obesity, suggesting that sustained obesity may accelerate brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that persistent obesity could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing brain aging. Therefore, reducing both the severity and duration of obesity exposure may be crucial for preserving brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. QIU said, “As the aging population grows, there has been a notable rise in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and others, that currently lack a cure. This research proposes that maintaining long-term weight control can contribute to improved brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the research team plans to integrate multi-omics approaches to explore the biological pathways that influence both brain and body health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, “Long-term obesity impacts brain morphology, functional connectivity and cognition in adults” has been published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study extracted obesity measure, brain images and cognition from the UK Biobank database, which comprised over 500,000 participants aged 40 years and above with diverse ethnic backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#295a50405b405a0745484069594645505c074c4d5c074142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Iris Lai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://polyu.edu.hk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PolyU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Iris Lai – PolyU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00396-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Long-term obesity impacts brain morphology, functional connectivity and cognition in adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Anqi QIU et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term obesity impacts brain morphology, functional connectivity and cognition in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although obesity has been implicated in brain and cognitive health, the effect of longitudinal obesity trajectories on brain and cognitive aging remains insufficiently understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using multifaceted obesity measurements from the UK Biobank, we identified five distinct obesity trajectories: low-stable, moderate-stable, high-stable, increasing and decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed that individuals in the decreasing trajectory showed minimal adverse effects on brain structure and cognitive performance, compared with the low-stable trajectory (low obesity levels over time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the increasing and moderate- and high-stable trajectories were associated with progressively greater impairments in brain morphology, functional connectivity and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, adverse effects extended from fronto-mesolimbic regions in the increasing trajectory to parietal and temporal regions in the moderate-stable trajectory, culminating in widespread brain abnormalities in the high-stable group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the dynamic relationship between obesity evolution and brain-cognitive health, underscoring the clinical importance of long-term monitoring and management of obesity through a multifaceted approach.&lt;/p&gt;

mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13833359/Selena-Gomezs-bizarre-mental-health-therapy-cold-water-hot-temperature.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MBT - which teaches people to focus on the present moment – is a growing movement based on ancient Eastern traditions of meditation and CBT is a type of psychological therapy more commonly used to treat &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-627e8310-1584-11f0-85a1-67e81e2aff15"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MBT is designed to help the patient develop a healthier, more accepting relationship with their thoughts and feelings, while CBT &lt;span&gt;looks at how we think about situations, and how these thoughts affect the way we act and feel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of the therapies is to change thinking patterns and behavior to achieve a more positive outcome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US Pain Foundation reports more than 51 million American adults live with chronic pain and pain in America costs as much as $635 billion a year in direct health care costs, lost productivity, and disability payments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common treatment for back pain is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, and muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine, but they have a high risk for abuse and overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, nearly 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, and more than 81,000 deaths involved either prescription or illicit opioids - an increase of approximately 400 percent over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is hoped that promoting mindfulness-based practices as an alternative to opioid use for pain management could potentially help reduce the opioid epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, participants were divided equally between the two treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both treatments involved eight weekly two-hour group sessions led by experienced therapists, with recommended daily home practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of 12 months, both groups showed significant improvements with less intense pain, improved physical function, and an improved quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also found the participants' reliance on drugs had decreased. It is unclear what medications they were prescribed for their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially, researchers believed MBT would prove more effective, but both therapies were found to provide similar relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: 'MBT and CBT were associated with safe improvements in pain and functional outcomes among adults affected with refractory, complex, opioid-treated chronic lower back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to better understand how to support dissemination and implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments for chronic pain and their coverage by health plans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other studies have shown mind hacks to be just as effective as drugs to treat various ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2015 study published in The Lancet, found mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) led to similar outcomes as antidepressants when treating the mental disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the average pain severity, based on the Brief Pain Inventory score (BPI), over 12 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows physical limitations people with back pain experienced measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found patients on a MBCT course suffered almost the same rates of recurrence as those taking anti-depressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over two years, relapse rates were 44 percent in the MBCT group compared to 47 per cent in the medication group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests it offers an 'alternative treatment' for those averse to the idea of taking drugs, said the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, CBT is a very popular and well-researched form of psychotherapy in the US and often considered a first-line treatment for various mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts believe it could be used in other situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study, it was found that CBT may work better for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome than medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study of more than 500 patients found counselling over the phone or online significantly reduced painful symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to 15 percent of Americans suffer from IBS, which mainly causes abdominal pain, bloating and the embarrassment of having to rush to the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts say less than half benefit from drugs such as laxatives or fiber supplements, which doctors are recommended to prescribe in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers led by the University of Southampton in the UK looked at IBS sufferers on the standard treatment of medication, comparing them with those also given CBT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found patients given the talking therapy, with either a manual or website to work through, saw their symptoms get much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Not just any breast cancer—this one targets triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and hardest to treat. Unlike other vaccines, it doesn’t just help the immune system respond after cancer shows up. It teaches your body to stop cancer before it even starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this bold effort is a vaccine developed through a partnership between &lt;a href="https://www.anixa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anixa Biosciences&lt;/a&gt; in San Jose, California and the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of research and a recent clinical trial, the results are now being called “incredibly promising.” The vaccine works by training your immune system to recognize and destroy specific cancer-linked proteins before they can grow into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_different_kind_of_protection"&gt;A Different Kind of Protection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most vaccines you’ve heard of are designed to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-antiviral-chewing-gum-blocks-influenza-and-other-infectious-diseases/"&gt;infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt;. This one is different. It targets a protein called alpha-lactalbumin. This protein is normally found in breast tissue during lactation but reappears in many TNBC tumors. If your body learns to recognize this protein as a threat, it may stop those cancer cells before they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The vaccine targets a lactation protein called α-lactalbumin, which is no longer found after lactation in normal, aging tissues but is present in most triple-negative breast cancers. If breast cancer develops, the vaccine is designed to prompt the immune system to attack the tumor and keep it from growing. (CREDIT: Cleveland Clinic) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea behind the vaccine, and it’s showing real signs of success in early trials. Sixteen women took part in the first phase of testing. All had already completed treatment for TNBC. They received three doses of the vaccine over a span of six weeks. Doctors measured signs of immune activity through increases in key markers: IFNγ and IL-17, both of which suggest T-cell activity, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-gene-editing-breakthrough-eliminates-50-of-head-neck-tumors/"&gt;specific antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that signal a strong immune defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Day 14, levels of IL-17 had risen sharply. By Day 56, IFNγ levels had also increased significantly. In total, 12 out of the 16 women showed clear T-cell responses that met the trial’s strict standards. These results suggest the vaccine is doing what it was designed to do—stimulate a strong immune reaction against potential cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="no_major_side_effects"&gt;No Major Side Effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more encouraging is how well patients tolerated the vaccine. The maximum tolerated dose—10 micrograms of alpha-lactalbumin combined with 10 micrograms of zymosan—caused only mild irritation at the injection site. There were no flu-like symptoms, no &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-protein-that-could-restore-youthful-muscle-strength/"&gt;muscle aches&lt;/a&gt;, and no troubling lab results. This is a critical step forward for any new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase 2 study trial is expected to commence this year and is projected to last approximately two to three years. Immunological responses to the vaccine will be made available as the trial advances, providing a faster and more cost-effective path toward potential approval and/or partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to unveil our Phase 2 study plan, bringing us one step closer to a potentially transformative therapy for breast cancer patients," said Dr. Amit Kumar. "By targeting treatment rather than prevention, we can reach a broader patient population and potentially expedite the process of regulatory approval and partnerships. This trial marks a key milestone in advancing our mission to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lab-grown-t-cells-engineered-to-live-longer-and-fight-cancer-more-effectively/"&gt;fight cancer&lt;/a&gt; through innovative therapies. While our Phase 2 trial focuses on the therapeutic market, with the data obtained in this trial, we expect to conduct additional, more informed studies for both recurrence prevention and primary prevention with partners in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;G. Thomas Budd, M.D. (CREDIT: Cleveland Clinic) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="one_woman_s_brave_first_step"&gt;One Woman’s Brave First Step&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Davis became the first person in the world to receive this vaccine in October 2021. Her story began three years earlier, when she sensed something wasn’t right despite an early biopsy that showed no signs of cancer. She pushed for more testing and, at 41, was diagnosed with TNBC. With no family history of cancer, she underwent chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reaching remission, she joined the clinical trial at Cleveland Clinic. Davis, a registered nurse, felt confident joining after hearing about the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-vaccine-successfully-treats-skin-and-pancreatic-cancer/"&gt;vaccine’s success&lt;/a&gt; in animal trials. “That was all I needed to hear,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how we advance medicine,” Davis said. “It’s important to be a part of those things. I am just beyond grateful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tragically, on January 31, 2024, Jennifer Davis delivered heartbreaking news to those closest to her: her cancer had returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She urged her friends not to lose momentum in their advocacy. “She said, ‘I had the lowest dose. Do not let this stop your efforts. There are so many women out there that we need to save.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Jennifer Davis, a resilient woman from a small Ohio town, holds a special place in this milestone. She became the world's first recipient of the vaccine.

It took 20 years just to reach the human trial phase, and Jennifer proudly became the very first recipient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think she was meant to receive that first dose,” Laura said. “She was so strong, so positive, and she believed there was something else out there.” Though she understood the early-stage trial was just the beginning, Jennifer held onto hope—not just for herself, but for the future of countless others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, on April 13, 2024, Jennifer passed away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_long_road_to_a_breakthrough"&gt;A Long Road to a Breakthrough&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roots of this vaccine trace back more than 20 years. Much of the early science was developed by the late Dr. Vincent Tuohy at Cleveland Clinic. Years later, Dr. Amit Kumar, CEO of a biotech company called Anixa Biosciences, saw the early data and immediately recognized the potential. “I looked at it and I saw the vision,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar and his team partnered with the Cleveland Clinic and secured funding from the U.S. Department of Defense to run the Phase 1 trial. They are now implementing the Phase 2 study involving 600 women. In this trial, half will receive the vaccine and the other half will receive a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-shingles-vaccine-significantly-reduces-dementia-risk/"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. If successful, the researchers hope to win FDA approval within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This vaccine is designed to direct the immune system to destroy TNBC cancer cells through a mechanism that has never previously been utilized for cancer vaccine development,” Kumar said. “Our goal is to initially evaluate the vaccine’s ability to prevent recurrence of cancer in survivors, and continue with extension studies to eventually determine its effectiveness in preventing the initial onset of TNBC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if the vaccine teaches the body not to grow tumors, Kumar responded, “That’s exactly right. It’s teaching your body to destroy the cells that can grow a tumor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_way_to_think_about_cancer"&gt;A New Way to Think About Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human immune system is excellent at fighting off &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/microbial-infections-in-the-brain-might-play-a-significant-role-in-dementia-and-alzheimer/"&gt;viruses and bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But cancer is harder to stop because it begins in your own cells. “All of the cells that become cancerous in your body came from normal, healthy cells,” Kumar explained. “The difference is not big, so the immune system has a harder time recognizing a cancer cell and distinguishing it from a healthy cell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A researcher conducts a breast cancer vaccine related experiment in a lab at Cleveland Clinic.

This approach could lead to a future where breast cancer, especially the aggressive triple-negative kind, is not just treatable—but preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With thousands of lives lost to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-discovery-reduces-breast-cancer-recurrence/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; every year in the U.S., and one in eight women at risk of developing the disease, the stakes are high.

			&lt;p&gt;Additives that are commonly found in ultra-processed foods could be increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; when mixed together in certain ways, new research has shown – which may prompt a rethink in health guidelines for additive use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Sorbonne Paris North University in France, the research adds to a &lt;a href="https://cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/4973"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; scrutinizing the potential health impacts of these additives – which are used to make foods last longer and taste better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mixtures of food additives are daily consumed worldwide by billions of people," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004570"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "So far, safety assessments have been performed substance by substance due to lack of data on the effect of multi-exposure to combinations of additives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157806" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157806" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DiabetesRisk.jpg" alt="Diabetes risk" class="wp-image-157806 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DiabetesRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DiabetesRisk-600x264.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157806" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Two additive mixtures were linked to an elevated risk of type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="157803" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. (de la Garanderie, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our objective was to identify most common food additive mixtures, and investigate their associations with type 2 diabetes incidence in a large prospective cohort."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at public health data from 108,643 people followed for an average of almost 8 years, charting diet records against cases of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-implicates-salt-in-type-2-diabetes-but-lets-look-at-the-facts"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Computer algorithms were used to calculate the mixtures of additives across eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the five additive combinations analyzed were linked to an increase in type 2 diabetes risk. The first, a mix including modified starches, guar gum, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan"&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt;, which is often found in broths, dairy desserts, and sauces, was associated with an 8 percent higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was a mixture including citric acid, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_citrate"&gt;sodium citrates&lt;/a&gt;, and artificial sweeteners, which is often found in soft drinks and sweetened beverages. It was associated with a 13 percent higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual with studies structured like this, the data doesn't show direct cause and effect – that it's these additives specifically causing more cases of type 2 diabetes. However, the associations are significant enough to raise concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge, these findings provide the first insight into the food additives that are frequently ingested together (due to their co-occurrence in industrially-processed food products or resulting from the co-ingestion of foods in dietary patterns) and how these additive mixtures may be involved in type 2 diabetes etiology," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004570"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some major limitations to the study. The majority of the participants here were women, and it's not clear how far these findings might extend more generally – across other countries, for example, where food regulations vary. There's also the difficulty of exactly calculating additive mixes and overlap across so many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;dietary patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The observed associations are both less than 20 percent, so residual confounding is likely a significant problem within this study," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/mixtures-of-common-food-additives-could-be-linked-to-type-ii-diabetes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alan Barclay, Honorary Associate at the University of Sydney, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it raises an issue that's barely been looked at before: how additives might combine in the way they influence our health. Further research could look at the reasons behind this association, and how it adds to what we know about the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;harms of ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that a combination of food additives may be of interest to consider in safety assessments, and they support public health recommendations to limit non-essential additives," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004570"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004570"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you ever lay in bed at night overthinking all of the embarrassing things you've done since childhood? Same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As you're tracing this infinity symbol, you're going to just follow it with you eyes — only your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What this does is activate your vestibular center which is involved with your balance and eye movements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Joe Whittington, a US-based emergency room medic, taking control of your eye movement by focusing on a single object can help restore calm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-d019c940-15ff-11f0-aa7e-e9a6ec605a7c"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; the vestibular system — located within the inner ear — is stimulated by movement up or down, backward or forwards, and around or over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Focusing on gentle, slow and predictable movements are just one of the techniques, the health service suggests to calm a sensitive vestibular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the method isn't a replacement for professional support, many praised Dr Whittington's advice to ease the nightly onslaught of overthinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Didn’t realize why I did this.. but it makes sense now,' one &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-d01d4bb0-15ff-11f0-aa7e-e9a6ec605a7c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; user said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others also compared it to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, a psychological treatment that's been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That’s almost the same thing as EMDR. Science behind it is fascinating!', another wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'DIY EMDR therapy,' a second said, with a third adding: 'Sounds like the same science behind EMDR therapy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EMDR is recommended by NHS watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to help treat PTSD alongside other talking therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep deprivation can lead to obesity, memory loss, diabetes, heart disease, heightened and unstable emotions, impaired ability to learn and a reduced immune response, leaving you vulnerable to disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the method isn't a replacement for professional support, many praised Dr Whittington's advice to ease the nightly onslaught of overthinking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It uses one of two ways to process memories — moving your eyes from side to side or tapping from side to side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is believed to stimulate either side of your brain in an alternating left-right fashion to help you access your subconscious mind and process what is stored in there and how it affects you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People often take around 10 to 20 minutes normally to nod off after turning off the lights, the Sleep Foundation say.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year, a study found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that around one in six Brits suffer insomnia, yet 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The poll of 2,000 people, by The Sleep Charity, found nine in ten experience some sort of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behaviours when unable to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c8412070-d4c2-11ef-a087-8dda3d723b5a"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, stroke and infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which figures suggest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-13345721/Do-undiagnosed-sleep-disorder-Warning-14million-Brits-unknowingly-living-condition-prove-dangerous-cost-NHS-billions.html"&gt;affects up to 14million Brits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, sleep deprivation takes its own toll, from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e4b36540-d983-11ef-bf36-47316f776e33"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-d5cba4c0-15f1-11f0-856d-25ce04a1124c" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14591519/Doctor-technique-beat-overthinking-insomnia-infinity-tracing.html"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;HOW MUCH SLEEP SHOULD YOU GET?

During spring/summer try sleeping with your bedroom window open to reduce the temperature and increase ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;5) Limit alcohol in the evenings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you might initially fall into deep sleep more easily, you then wake up frequently during the night and have poorer deep sleep overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;6) Supplement vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D plays a role in sleep.
