              &lt;p&gt;Since being nominated as America’s new health czar, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said and done a lot of questionable stuff, the latest of which is to share his disturbing approach to the bird flu epidemic. RFK’s strategy for protecting the nation’s fowl population? Eh, just let the flu cull the herd and see if anything good comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy has been suggesting that to defeat bird flu, you first have to let it get its groove on. The Times quotes a recent Fox News interview, in which Kennedy told the news channel’s listeners that America “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it”—a notion Kennedy has offered multiple times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy is only responsible for human health, not bird health (the Department of Agriculture is the point agency for that). Still, it’s not necessarily super comforting that Kennedy’s first impulse when he hears about a communicable illness is to just sit back and let it do its thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas, told the Times that Kennedy’s plan was “a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” also calling it a “recipe for disaster.” Experts like Hansen seem to agree that giving the virus a free pass to spread would just allow it to mutate and grow more powerful. Indeed, other current and former federal officials and scientists that the newspaper spoke to all said that stepping back and letting bird flu ravage domestic chicken populations was really only a recipe for lost farm profits and more dead birds. Kennedy’s strategy (and the apparent worldview that informs it) also seems to hammer home the point that he is, on a fundamental level, unqualified to head the HHS. The Times writes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy “means longer quarantine, more downtime, more lost revenue and increased expenses,” said a U.S.D.A. scientist who was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seems like yet another good example of why—when it comes to finding someone to lead the nation’s most powerful scientific policy and research organization—nominating a guy who self-admittedly &lt;a href="https://blog.ucs.org/dminovi/robert-f-kennedy-is-unfit-to-lead-u-s-public-health-agencies/"&gt;isn’t a scientist&lt;/a&gt; and doesn’t know anything about science might have been a stupid idea. But hey, while it seems increasingly unlikely that Kennedy can protect us from easily preventable illnesses like measles, and while he’s demonstrated a willingness to cut funding to critically important health research (including &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/3/18/2311017/-RFK-Jr-s-anti-vax-stance-is-jeopardizing-cancer-treatments"&gt;cancer treatments)&lt;/a&gt;, and while he doesn’t seem particularly concerned that a nationwide chicken plague has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/egg-prices-wholesale.html#:~:text=An%20outbreak%20of%20bird%20flu,a%20dozen%20at%20their%20peak."&gt;driving up egg prices&lt;/a&gt;, at least he’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg"&gt;made America safe for tallow again&lt;/a&gt;, right? Yeah, tasty french fries are a good tradeoff for the breakdown of national health policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals that bowel movement frequency significantly influences physiology and long-term health, with the best outcomes linked with passing stools once or twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested associations between constipation and diarrhea with higher risks of infections and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since these findings were observed in sick patients, it remained unclear whether irregular bathroom visits were the cause or result of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires.  (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do hope that this work will kind of open clinicians' minds a bit to the potential risks of not managing bowel movement frequencies," senior author Sean Gibbons at the Institute for Systems Biology told AFP, explaining that doctors often view irregular movements as merely a "nuisance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons and his team collected clinical, lifestyle, and biological data – including blood chemistry, gut microbiome, genetics and more – from over 1,400 healthy adult volunteers with no signs of active disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants' self-reported bowel movement frequencies were categorized into four groups: constipation (one or two bowel movements per week), low-normal (three to six per week), high-normal (one to three per day), and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stools linger too long in the gut, microbes exhaust the available fiber – which they ferment into beneficial short-chain fatty acids – and instead ferment proteins, producing toxins like p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we found is that even in healthy people who are constipated, there is a rise in these toxins in the bloodstream," said Gibbons, noting that these toxins are particularly burdensome to the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145266" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/fx1.jpg" alt="Graphic showing the study findings" class="wp-image-145266" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145266" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Toxins like p-cresol sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) in the bloodstream are particularly burdensome to the kidneys. (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruits and vegetables key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases of diarrhea, the team found clinical chemistries indicative of inflammation and liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons explained that during diarrhea, the body excretes excessive bile acid, which the liver would otherwise recycle to dissolve and absorb dietary fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144992" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144992" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642.jpg" alt="Anatomical diagram of upper body with liver highlighted" class="size-full wp-image-144992" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642-295x415.jpg 295w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642-600x844.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144992" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The liver usually recycles bile acid to dissolve and absorb dietary fats.

&lt;p&gt;However, Gibbons emphasized that more research is needed to define this optimal range more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographically, younger people, women, and those with a lower body mass index tended to have less frequent bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormonal and neurological differences between men and women may explain the gap, Gibbons said, along with the fact that men generally consume more food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144950" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642.png" alt="Food on a table with hands grabbing it" class="size-full wp-image-144950" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642-533x415.png 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642-600x467.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A more plant-dominant diet can have health benefits.

&lt;p&gt;"It was eating more fruit and vegetables, that was the biggest signal we saw," said Gibbons, along with drinking plenty of water, regular physical activity, and eating a more plant-dominant diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the research could involve designing a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="154973" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to manage the bowel movements of a large group of people, followed over an extended period to assess its potential in disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B. suis &lt;/em&gt;is an extremely infectious bacteria that's usually found in pigs. The most common symptom in pigs is reproductive losses, such as stillbirths, though they can also develop other symptoms, such as abscesses and arthritis. In humans, it causes an insidious, hard to detect infection called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;brucellosis&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to describe an infection from any &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; species: &lt;em&gt;B. suis, B. melitensis,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;B. abortus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;B. canis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, there are only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/BrucellosisFactSheet.pdf"&gt;80 to 140 brucellosis cases&lt;/a&gt; reported each year, and they're mostly caused by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/brucellosis"&gt;B. melitensis and B. abortus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. People tend to get infected by eating raw (unpasteurized) milk and cheeses. &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, however, is generally linked to hunting and butchering feral pigs and hogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; species were designated as select agents by the US government, a classification to flag pathogens and toxins that have the potential to be a severe threat to public health, such as if they're used in a bioterror attack. &lt;a href="https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/list.htm"&gt;The current list&lt;/a&gt; includes things like anthrax and Ebola virus. &lt;em&gt;Brucella &lt;/em&gt;species were originally listed because they can be easily aerosolized, and only a small number of the bacterial cells are needed to spark an infection. In humans, infections can be both localized and systemic and have &lt;a href="https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_suis.pdf"&gt;a broad range of clinical manifestations&lt;/a&gt;. Those include brain infections, neurological conditions, arthritis, anemia, respiratory involvement, pancreatitis, cardiovascular complications, like aneurysms, and inflammation of the spinal cord, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441831/"&gt;among many other things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/17/2024-29567/agricultural-bioterrorism-protection-act-of-2002-biennial-review-and-republication-of-the-select"&gt;In January&lt;/a&gt;, federal officials removed &lt;em&gt;Brucella &lt;/em&gt;species from the select agents list—a designation that limits the types and amount of research that can be done on a pathogen. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the reason for the removal was &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/aphis-updates-select-agents-toxins-registration-list-removes-agents"&gt;to ease those limits&lt;/a&gt;, thereby making it easier for researchers to conduct veterinary studies and develop vaccines for animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perilous present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, the doctors went to gather more information about how the man could have contracted this rare species. The man said he wasn't a hunter, but recalled receiving a gift of feral swine meat on several occasions in 2017 from a local hunter. Though he couldn’t recall the specific hunter who gave him the biohazardous bounty, he did remember handling the raw meat and blood with his bare hands—a clear transmission risk—before cooking and eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

            In the early 2000s, when Dr. Alexandra Cvijanovich was completing her medical training in Utah, her team cared for a 13-year-old boy with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001185.htm#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,Walker%20Boulevard%2C%20Augusta%20GA%2030912." target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a degenerative neurological disease that can be fatal. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,10%20years%20after%20measles%20infection." target="_blank"&gt;rare complication&lt;/a&gt; of the measles virus that appears years after the initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00023b5vzytp5e1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The boy had been infected with measles when he was 7 months old, after contact with an unvaccinated child. Years later, he died of the complications, and Cvijanovich has never forgotten about him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00033b5vl58o0njg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He … got the virus before he could be immunized. And that’s just a tragic, horrible, preventable death,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Officials recommend that children get their first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;12 and 15 months&lt;/a&gt; of age. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the measles virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To achieve herd immunity, where enough people are vaccinated that infection doesn’t widely spread in the community, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of the population needs to be vaccinated, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Now a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Cvijanovich treats people from all over the state – including the southeastern region, which is currently part of one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/health/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-oklahoma"&gt;more than 300&lt;/a&gt; people across three states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00063b5v8wgn9zx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She often tells the story of her 13-year-old patient to families that are hesitant to vaccinate their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00073b5vjv7sqlbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I tried to use stories of patients that I’ve taken care of,” she said, “and then I also tried to plead with people that they actually think about the greater good of the community around them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00083b5viqo5pcl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many pediatricians say they are seeing an increase in parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children with the MMR vaccine and others. Here are some of their tips for communicating with vaccine-hesitant parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000a3b5v0qltwc67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the key to communicating with families about vaccination is to address their specific concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000b3b5v0ccunfj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tailoring your approach and your communication to that family-specific concern has been the most effective for me and my practice,” said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “That is really what helps families feel confident about their choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000c3b5vxrmzr9uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For some families, this includes addressing worries about side effects they may hear through anecdotes in their communities. Pediatricians say these often circulate in community or family WhatsApp groups or through parent Facebook groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000d3b5vrzz6ktad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So I am taking time to say, ‘pull it up, let’s look it up together. Who did it come from? Do you know this person? Do you know their full medical history?’ ” Bracho-Sanchez said. “And I do spend time outlining the difference between something happening to someone around the time that they had a vaccine and someone having something happen as a result of the vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000e3b5v0m3eemnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts warn against getting medical advice or information from community social media and urge patients to have conversations with their providers instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000f3b5vnkdhgvkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other families may have concerns about specific ingredients in vaccines, and doctors recommend understanding which ones are causing worries, like metals or preservatives. Explaining how those same ingredients might also be found in foods or other daily life exposures can quell those fears, according to Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000h3b5vkai9xx43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Cvijanovich has found with her own experiences, helping patients understand the illnesses they are preventing with vaccination can be helpful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000i3b5vp0khe9zf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines have been victims of their own success,” Johns said. “We don’t see many of these vaccine-preventable illnesses anymore [and] people think they’re no big deal. And the fact is that they really are a very big deal.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000j3b5vrgcnl70h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With measles, the consequences can be severe. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000k3b5vgo32ny0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/health/measles-vaccine-shot-booster-adults-wellness"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000l3b5vj0j8ius2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being a pediatrician, watching my patients grow up, that’s the best part of my job,” Cvijanovich said. “I mean, that’s why I go into work every day. I love seeing babies who then enter middle school and graduate from high school and go off to college. That’s fantastic. And the best tool I have to accomplish this is vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000n3b5v5a2pkz8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians say that approaching these conversations in “partnership” has gone a long way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000o3b5v2buhn8pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pediatricians want what’s best for your child. That’s why I’m in this business, and I know that is true for you as a parent about your own child,” Johns said. “So given that, let’s talk through why you’re concerned that this might not be the best thing for your child and why I’m convinced that it is. And let’s sort through that together.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000p3b5vd0af86a1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even when parents might be fearful about getting certain vaccines for their children, trust in doctor-patient relationships can be helpful, according to Bracho-Sanchez.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000q3b5v8em1qljx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some parents will still say, ‘OK, I trust you, Doctor. Let’s go ahead and do this.’ But it doesn’t mean that they’re completely fearless, right? They trust me and our relationship and my explanation and the conversations that we have, [which is] enough to go ahead and vaccinate,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000r3b5vpgojwb60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if parents choose not to vaccinate their children at the end of an appointment, doctors can leave the door open for future conversation and continuing dialogue, Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8eyglqk00023b5v16tcl9dy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials say the current measles outbreak, which started in West Texas, is rooted in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt; whose members may not seek traditional health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ey6gls00003b5v1a71pseo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In talking with members of the community, we’re not necessarily seeing that this is hesitancy … around religion. We’re seeing it much more as they have been impacted, just like the rest of Americans with a lot of the social media,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f045rp00003b5v5r0i6631@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she has found one-on-one conversations or community health workers meeting with small groups to be most useful in addressing this hesitancy in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000t3b5vzfecq36s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Anti-vaccine websites and misinformation have become “more sophisticated,” Cvijanovich said. This raises the amount of concerns that many parents have when considering whether to vaccinate their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000u3b5v2hrkdhtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important not to be dismissive and not to be superior. Not say, ‘Well, I have my MD degree, and therefore, I learned how to analyze data, and you don’t know this,’” she said. Doctors need to be “understanding that there is a vast amount of information available to parents these days, and it is a constant challenge to figure out what’s accurate and what’s inaccurate, what’s misleading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f04p6n00023b5v7cgyn426@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some false claims have spread so broadly that Cvijanovich says some of her patients are not so much “vaccine-hesitant” as “anti-vaccine.” She described a family that expressed that they think the measles cases in New Mexico are a “conspiracy to try to get their kids vaccinated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f0b8mu00053b5vx407eyh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So [my] arguments, they do tend to fall on deaf ears, unfortunately, but I continue to have the discussions,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000w3b5vsadbacz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With any infectious disease, the spread affects not only individuals but communities. With a virus as contagious as measles, which can stay airborne for two hours even after an infected person leaves a room, its effect on entire communities is heightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000x3b5vuocirfar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors have found that highlighting protection for the whole over the self can be an effective strategy in encouraging vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000y3b5vcmixb0nt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sometimes, people are willing to get infected and deal with the side effects that you do get infected, but sometimes you can reach them if they realize, ‘hey, I’m not just talking about myself. I can make potentially other people sick, too,’ ” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

These autopsies revealed a reduced presence of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology among regular egg consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that egg consumption may have a protective effect on the brain, potentially slowing the progression of Alzheimer's-related changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis indicated that 39 percent of the protective effect of egg consumption was mediated through dietary choline, a nutrient abundant in eggs that is essential for brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline assists in the production of neurotransmitters, particularly acetylcholine, which is vital for memory and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline, found in abundance in eggs, supports the structural integrity of brain cell membranes and aligns with previous research linking choline intake to enhanced cognitive function. This study strengthens evidence proposing a connection between choline consumption and mental acuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of choline-rich diets for brain health are increasingly recognized; such diets may include foods like eggs. With Alzheimer's disease being a major contributor to dementia worldwide, the link between diet and cognitive aging grows more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Ball, Professor of Community Health and Wellbeing, and Karly Bartrim, Lecturer in Nutrition and Dietetics at The University of Queensland, discussed the study's findings from a food questionnaire on The Conversation website. They queried participants about the frequency of their egg consumption in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals reported their egg consumption as rare—possibly once a month, 1-6 times a week, or daily. The researchers observed, "Overall, people who consumed eggs 1–6 times per week had the lowest risk of death during the study period (29% lower for heart disease deaths and 17% lower for overall deaths) compared to those who rarely or never ate eggs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they clarified, "Eating eggs daily did not increase the risk of death either."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the cholesterol content leading some to demonize eggs due to potential health impacts, this study offers a more encouraging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol often lurks in the shadows, ominously dubbed the "silent killer" due to its symptom-free presence until it starkly manifests in serious health issues like heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:48:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPR0FicG14MlNxYzNXQlRtYTBUMGw2QWlSS2hLbUM4RHNpdS1wNGNZWFJwMjY1SXU0aTdWeE1aMnFENDJFTGRraU9ZOUxHcGtLMUNLRmdWTU5xUDZaSTg5Y2VsOU9vekFkcUNUYjZpLUFveGlOUnU2RDJPQ0hyRVVCbWFTcXJhaGptcE0w0gGQAUFVX3lxTE0waFdRaU9iaFhSdDUzd0dFMnNHTUd6RHdQMUxxOW1GbW5jdERXTGcwMWVCV19PU1RKS3lJdnRod3ZDUUc5d1NES3BmSWVqZGhGYmx5dWd0NHhFMXc1bG5pa0ZfRU9qNlNJWG1Ncmg0X2kzQkZ2bjJReV94Tm9MOHNwZ1N6R211U25XY2JjeWVTcQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak could last a year, health official in Texas says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQQ3FSTFlRSnN4Y0lHYThyT2xodTBGQ2NwSGlkT3ZGcGFTY1lwMHF6eGF3LTY4U2M2ME0zMVltTndUakNOWF96S3ZVRFJ0aF9vSnJzaEd0THRDeExrSXFmTFlMd1RLcTFmenZCanhvZkxyR2JCRnpXcmZCLVdkWGRQN0xvOVBZRTR0NnNWb0xWZEEyZy1DR2fSAYwBQVVfeXFMTy1CeHRfMzExYUNRdUx6bEtLT0o4ZnhwSkFUWS0wVnRzRXVIN0xTMUNxVWtJLXhoUmFkdVBYOEwtaGhXcnB2a1BvS2NxcjU3YWluZDBwc0lzWklacGx6U2R6NUtBZS1iMjJNWFhieS02bTFIQ1VjY0JqOTdtMVEwS1VPMDlEOGxlNU9Kc1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Three hundred and twenty-one cases have been reported in the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, the states said Tuesday. This is an increase of 25 cases since an update on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Texas has reported 279 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico has reported 38 cases, and Oklahoma had previously reported four cases.

            Thirty-eight patients have been hospitalized, an increase of two over last week. Ninety-five cases are in children up to age 4, and 130 are among young people ages 5 to 17. Cases have been identified in 11 Texas counties and two New Mexico counties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In Texas, the bulk of the cases, 191, are in Gaines County, where the outbreak was first identified. In New Mexico, most cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma State Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said last week that it had four measles cases in people with “exposure associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000g3b5vk5car7q3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although most of the cases are in people who were unvaccinated or who had unknown vaccination status, six were found in people who said they have received at least one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine: two in Texas and four in New Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000h3b5v0peba4em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death, a school-age child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico are continuing to investigate the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2tu000023b5vtze33pvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, officials expect continued spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases. … I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000k3b5vgyjkqsji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just think, it being so rural now, multistate, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000l3b5vk7p11roe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, officials say that increased testing capacity will be helpful in containing the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000m3b5vxjztejrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Labs have been set up in Lubbock, close to the epicenter of the outbreak. This means specimens no longer need to be sent via plane to Austin, reducing the time to get results from 72 hours to the same day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000n3b5vocpq0hji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Tuesday’s briefing, officials noted that identifying cases, exposures and unvaccinated people was critical in curtailing a measles outbreak in Chicago last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000o3b5vevnq94ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as we continue to have a pool of unvaccinated people, it will continue to spread. So it’s very hard to say it has peaked unless you have successfully vaccinated everyone who is unvaccinated,” said Dr. Olusimbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000p3b5v36irgtwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html#:~:text=Over%2030%2C000%20doses%20of%20measleswithout%20the%20City's%20rapid%20intervention." target="_blank"&gt;30,000&lt;/a&gt; MMR vaccinations were given to Chicago residents during the outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which kept it from crossing the 100-case mark, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the outbreak stopped at 64 reported cases, most of them linked to a shelter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epulfv00003b5vd39sxuwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a CNN tally, there have been at least 353 cases reported in the US as of March 18. This already surpasses the total number of cases for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000j3b5v1kisi7c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were 285 total measles cases reported in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is only the third year since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000 that an outbreak has led to more 200 cases. The others were 2014, when there was an outbreak tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/health/disneyland-measles/index.html"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, and 2019, when a nearly year-long outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt; came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The CDC has been assisting efforts on the ground in Texas, and Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, says local efforts are “dependent” on federal support.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000c3b5vzsabgj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our staffing to be able to do vaccination clinics and our epidemiology staff to do the investigations and contact tracing … so much of that is federally funded that we are very dependent on and very concerned about some of the potential staffing cuts that we’re seeing at the federal level, as well as some of the budget cuts,” he said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74391"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74392"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height.

Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74393"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNTl9sWkJCUENacWhpNEdKMVFXZ1V6akYxVjFkNlM4bHdLMEdDVkE5SXFGZk9TUHJXeDRuZTdiRU4xcTZiS3FOR0s3NGNXb2Yzc1lpbjNDTGhkTU9XdlF0RUlDR1lKMGdseG5wTmEwdjl4RVFCdGRNR0hSM3JjdldEM0p4dTM1WndFNGxZRkN1QmFWVDNWNFhHMHRtWVJjb0FvYi1tTGN3</guid></item><item><title>Debunked myths that vaccines cause autism are increasing stigma - The Guardian US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBuQ2VpTzVOQ0tkVFFuVVBaMXdzSkw3b0J4YlNPaEtBWkhCLWVyU0V2SVhnWVMwb2pNeDJQY1Z3bkU0ZnhTS2VKRi1JLS13ajRfZzFMLVVraW5aLVZwbHREVkdfZHFRNmNzTHdPNDZ1b2VCZUY4NUlDMjB4dEZNeTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;planning to devote research dollars&lt;/a&gt;

Many autistic people make it to adulthood without a diagnosis – despite the challenges that come even with mild cases, they are able to live independently. Others require lifetime support. While autism as a disability is defined by impairments, it is also associated with strengths, including &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/aut.2021.0037" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dedication, focus and creativity in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even in more challenging cases, parents of autistic children find it repugnant that other parents are risking their own children’s serious illness or death, ostensibly to avoid the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kate Abarca, a retired occupational therapist in South Carolina, says that learning to understand her son’s autism was immensely rewarding.

He was “normal” – just autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Hearing parents fret over vaccines causing autism “just makes me so angry”, says Lopez, adding: “Autistic people, we’re very logical, so that blows my mind even more.” Lopez remembers a particularly upsetting instance when his father’s former girlfriend told him he might not have autism had he not been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Eventually, Lopez became so fed up with the stigma he decided to disclose his autism on social media with the joke “vaccines are just computer updates for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f17ab753-8a2b-47f9-97a9-5acb680d4d4e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"RFK Jr sparks alarm after backing vitamins to treat measles amid outbreak","elementId":"f17ab753-8a2b-47f9-97a9-5acb680d4d4e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/rfk-jr-vitamins-measles-outbreak"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":6,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A 37-year-old autistic sound engineer said he finds misinformation so disturbing he loses sleep over it, adding that anti-vaxxers are not “entitled” to “their own set of facts”. He echoed Lopez’s sentiment that this cognitive dissonance can be especially distressing for autistic people: “It saps your energy away. You lose your appetite and your body temperature changes. It’s a drastically physical thing.”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knapp, too, said he’s lost days replaying social media conversations with anti-vaxxers over and over in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While Lopez is troubled by misunderstandings over autism, he says he’s most concerned over declining vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“People need to vaccinate.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0g001t3b73vyzw4mey@published"&gt;My girlfriend and I are arguing about what being supportive of one another looks like. It started with her participating in Dry January and me deciding not to. Neither of us drinks that much, I didn’t feel the need to examine my relationship with alcohol or feel the effects of abstaining from it as I have unconsciously gone more than a month without drinking alcohol before. Even though I morally supported her, I did not go out of my way to shield her from alcohol (she is not going through an addiction recovery program after all—she is a 33-year-old challenging herself).&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exzu0s00323b73jxhibsj3@published"&gt;The whole month she would get upset if I had a glass of wine with dinner or wanted to go to lunch at our favorite brewery, which has a lot of nonalcoholic options and which she typically doesn’t even order alcoholic drinks when we go. Even me choosing brunch at the place with the “best Blood Mary in town” (her words) was seen as me not being supportive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0i001u3b73bi7t5s1u@published"&gt;It has now evolved into me not supporting her fitness journey because I won’t participate in the things she does or diet. I don’t believe in diets. I was a wrestler in my youth and had a messed up relationship with food. I have since learned to eat and exercise in moderation and to enjoy both things. I support her goals—I encourage her, ask her about how her training is going, or how she’s liking various exercise classes or strength training sessions but I don’t want to join her in them. Apparently, by not wanting to go on a strenuous hike on a Sunday afternoon I’m being unsupportive. I was fine going on an easy to moderate hike but she wants to turn everything into a workout. I picked up Chipotle for us the other day and got her the healthy bowl option that she wanted but I was being “unsupportive” because I got my usual with extra guac and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0k001v3b73xo0xhu17@published"&gt;When I ask her what supporting her looks like, she says it is me being a part of the things she likes. But what if I don’t want to go to a hot yoga class (why is all yoga heated these days?!), or if I’d rather read a book than go on a walk after dinner every evening? How can I explain to her that being supportive doesn’t actually mean participating?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0k001y3b73dxk1h2bt@published"&gt;I don’t like the sound of this. It seems to me that your girlfriend is confusing “being supportive” with “adjusting your behaviors to match mine exactly.” That’s a pretty controlling mindset. If she’s unable to tolerate your status as an independent person who is allowed to make lifestyle choices that are different from hers—and if she treats every one of your aberrant choices as a direct affront to hers—then I’m not sure there’s much of a future in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0l001z3b735gdgx401@published"&gt;Tell your girlfriend that if she needs a partner whose lifestyle will match hers exactly, she may have to start looking for a new partner. A healthy relationship often pushes us to change our habits, but the desire has to be mutual, and these expectations still need to take everyone’s preferences and sensitivities into consideration. One person does not get to call all of the shots; in this situation, being accused of being “unsupportive” sounds a lot more like you’re being accused of being “disobedient.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8ewrh0k001n1gm4edtca0bo@published"&gt;My aunt is a doctor. I recently learned that before we were together, my fiancé incessantly messaged her office and wrote negative reviews, all because it didn’t support a therapy that very few doctors support—although apparently specialists to whom my aunt has referred people for other issues do support the therapy in question, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/dear-prudie-fiance-harassed-aunt-negative-reviews.html"&gt;which seems to be why my fiancé thought he could get things changed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 17-year-old boy in the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The teenager was admitted to a hospital in the Netherlands for knee surgery after getting injured while playing soccer. The surgery was successful, but when the patient woke up from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anesthesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he spoke exclusively in English and insisted "repeatedly" that he was in the U.S. Prior to this incident, he spoke the language only during English class in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not recognize his parents and could not speak or understand spoken Dutch, his native language. According to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-021-03236-z" target="_blank" data-url="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-021-03236-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report doctors wrote about his case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the patient had no history of psychiatric symptoms and no relevant medical family history, apart from some instances of depression on his mother's side of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The nurse who initially noticed the patient speaking English was not immediately worried by it, thinking the teen was experiencing&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714637/#:~:text=Emergence%20delirium%20(ED)%20is%20an,behavior%20%5B8%2C12%5D." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714637/#:~:text=Emergence%20delirium%20(ED)%20is%20an,behavior%20%5B8%2C12%5D." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;emergence delirium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a state of confusion that can occur during recovery from anesthesia. However, when medical staff still could not get the patient to speak a single word of Dutch a few hours later, they called for a psychiatric consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/can-you-forget-your-native-language" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/can-you-forget-your-native-language"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you forget your native language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychiatric team found the patient relaxed and attentive. He was able to answer questions, albeit in English spoken with a Dutch accent. Later on, he started to give short answers in Dutch but found it difficult to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The 17-year-old was diagnosed with foreign language syndrome (FLS), which happens when patients suddenly and involuntarily switch to using a second language instead of their native language for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; A neurologist found no abnormalities during a full neurological examination of the patient. Then, 18 hours after his surgery, the teen was able to understand Dutch but still couldn't speak it. Some of the teen's friends came to visit him the day after his surgery, and suddenly, he was able to understand and speak Dutch again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the teen spontaneously started speaking in his native language again, doctors saw no need to run any neuropsychological tests, electroencephalograms (EEG) or other types of brain scans on him. He was discharged three days post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;FLS is rare, with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6185554598107295609&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12991-024-00538-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-after-surgery-a-17-year-old-could-speak-only-a-foreign-language" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12991-024-00538-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12991-024-00538-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-after-surgery-a-17-year-old-could-speak-only-a-foreign-language" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about nine cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described in medical literature.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In most of these cases, the patient was a white male who switched from their native language to another one they had learned later in life; the patients weren't typically bilingual growing up. The race of the patients in two cases was not documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the case report said FLS is rarely seen in children, and they suspected that they were the first to formally document a case of FLS in an adolescent. In total, they found eight reported cases of FLS that were similar to that of their patient, in which the person affected switched to a completely different language rather than speaking in a way that could be perceived as a foreign accent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happens in a related condition — &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/italian-womans-rare-foreign-accent-syndrome-caused-her-to-sound-canadian" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/italian-womans-rare-foreign-accent-syndrome-caused-her-to-sound-canadian"&gt;&lt;u&gt;called foreign accent syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — in which people adopt a speech pattern that makes it sound like they're speaking with an accent. The rare condition has often, but not always, been seen in the context of brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly why FLS happens is unknown, although there have been other cases in which the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216510/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216510/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;syndrome emerges after anesthesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The case report authors noted that an anesthetic's effects on cognition, as well as the clearance of anesthetic drugs from the central nervous system, can lead to emergence delirium. For that reason, they're not sure if FLS can be classified as a distinct condition or merely a variation of emergence delirium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP-MYwcVa3wTQxHK54UMjbvpqgWJCwrpZ9k" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP-MYwcVa3wTQxHK54UMjbvpqgWJCwrpZ9k slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A similar process happens when you get an infection, like a cold or the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to get stronger, but often, what motivates you changes as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, very few 20-year-olds exercise to maintain their independence but that takes on greater importance in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Hayley Madigan—a trainer, sports scientist and Oner Active athlete—about the best exercises to do if you’re new to exercise and over 65, she suggested focusing on functional everyday movements, like squats and step-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're older and maybe you live on your own, how are you gonna get your shopping bags upstairs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to be able to do step-ups. I want to be able to squat down. I want to be able to deadlift my bag from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And those are all functional movements that are taught in weight training," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no need to start with weights if you're new to strength training. The most important thing is to begin at the appropriate level and gradually increase the difficulty as you get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZWi8BagHxaMdE2pRSq799T" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZWi8BagHxaMdE2pRSq799T slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help, Madigan has provided options for each exercise so it suits your fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-exercises"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squat-to-chair"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Squat to chair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 8-10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in front of, but facing away from, a chair with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower your butt onto the seat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it easier: Use a higher chair so you don’t need to lower yourself so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Add weights to the movement by holding dumbbells or practice without a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why squats?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Squats will help you build strength primarily in your hamstrings (the muscles in the back of your thighs) but also in your glutes (the muscles in your butt) which power lots of everyday movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we sit down all day our glutes become weaker, which can lead to lower-back pain," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working on our glute strength can help remedy this, because the glutes support the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-step-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Step-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6-8 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in front of a slightly elevated surface, like a step or weight plate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place one foot on the elevated surface and push through your heel to extend your leg and rise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring your other foot on the elevated surface, then step back down carefully and with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the move, leading with the opposite foot. Continue, alternating sides with each step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it easier: Lower the elevated surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Choose a higher surface or hold a weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why step-ups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step-ups are another exercise that targets your glutes, along with your hamstrings and quads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These large muscles support your knee joint, so strengthening them can help you avoid some knee problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Step-ups are a really important one for knee strength and knee health, and also hip health, and that's really important for us as we get older," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to this move is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/lunges-bodyweight-exercises" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/lunges-bodyweight-exercises"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, but Madigan cautions that this exercise can be tricky if you have sore knees.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever I have period cramps, pelvic pain or a stabbing sensation in my thighs I get scared that I will have another ruptured cyst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her diagnosis in 2023, Nina says everyday life has massively changed for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "Living with endometriosis has changed my life entirely, it's taken away my favourite hobbies such as volleyball and it has placed a huge strain on my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It effects my job and my productivity as there are days when I cannot leave my bed due to the pain. It really scares me that I could lose my job as each month I am absent due to the insufferable pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina says the biggest challenge she has faced since her diagnosis is how endometriosis has effected her fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "I felt like my life fell apart as I had always dreamt of becoming a mum but with endometriosis it is likely that I will struggle to conceive naturally, so the freedom of choosing when I would like to be a mum has been taken away from me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis Action Month is calling for greater awareness towards the chronic condition, Nina believes knowledge of endometriosis is getting better but it can come with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "The diagnosis rate is getting better but it does mean more dedicated nurses within the NHS are needed to help women get the support they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BloodyEndoMidlands is a charity supporting women suffering with endometriosis in the West Midlands region, you can visit their support group Facebook page and website online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="article-body-link" href="http://hellorayo.co.uk/hits-radio/play/" target="_blank"&gt;First for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Rayo app.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Rayo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:32:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxPdzFkS0dPUVhWeHVnTmwyLUNQb0NXRjB1UXc1MEVaWFhFb2IyR1FoazRrbFNsSFlLNklFZmljV3oycldSRUhVX1o2RnRtdTZ3VnNkLXk3R0UwczVLMjhoWWdBbE1UNTRXeGZRd1hPNXVIcjlJWkdROC1rVTA1Yl9wYW45OGlfXzV5ck1JMU13Tk1vOFFVMng4UlZJNl9ydktnYzR5NGtBZkxRenFHYi01OV94VUN5bm4ycHAtbVdOSktEM2NGTlFiZ1J4NnBsT2dYbXNRYlBNQjNwQnA5SEowQmtmVGxkN1p0dFljS2xVUTEyWkUybDBTbXdmVQ</guid></item><item><title>I'm a colon cancer doctor.

This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is also the second most common cause of cancer deaths around the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Cancer Research UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that in industrialized countries like the US and UK, early-onset colorectal cancer is increasing by two to four percent every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since the 1990s, cancer statistics have shown that EOCRC (early-onset colorectal cancer) has increased by more than 50 percent, meaning it is the leading cause of cancer death in men and the second-leading cause in women under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is most commonly found in the sigmoid colon, the lowest part of the colon just before the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey conducted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance revealed that young patients with EOCRC often experience changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest red flag, however, is blood in the stool, on the toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If blood is bright red, it's 'newer' or came from lower in the digestive tract, such as in the sigmoid colon or rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if it's darker or black, it's 'older' and could have come from higher up in the colon or the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main reasons colorectal cancer is diagnosed so late or dismissed in young people is these signs could be attributed to more benign and common conditions like hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, roughly half of all Americans will have hemorrhoids at least once in their life, and one in 10 will be diagnosed with IBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although bright red rectal bleeding is commonly associated with hemorrhoids, the rising incidence of EOCRC means that any concerning symptoms in younger individuals should not be dismissed without further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This blood loss can also cause anemia, leading to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Why is there a surge of cases in young people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diets rich in red and processed meats, sedentary behavior, and obesity, are well-documented risk factors for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year a study from Cleveland Clinic's Center for Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer shed some light on why processed meats such as deli ham, hot dogs and burgers can be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13746823/oncologist-discovery-record-colon-cancer-patients.html"&gt;colleague Dr Suneel Kamath&lt;/a&gt; and his team collected plasma samples from 64 patients with colorectal cancer and found young patients had higher levels of compounds called metabolites from red and processed meat in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We think these metabolites help feed cancer cells and hijack normal cells, causing tumors to grow while healthy cells are deprived of the energy they need to function normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also thought to be the case for alcohol.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for obesity, the latest science tells us that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14292265/body-fat-areas-higher-risk-colon-cancer-study.html"&gt;carrying more visceral fat around organs like the colon&lt;/a&gt; may create inflammation, which makes cancer cells more likely to form.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a significant proportion of young patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer do not fit this typical high-risk profile. Many are fit, have healthy diets, and do not exhibit common lifestyle risks like smoking or drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This paradox points to the complexity of environmental exposures contributing to the disease, an active area of research that still comes with many unknowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the 'exposome' - the total amount of environmental exposures that a person encounters during their lifetime - has emerged as a valuable framework for how genetic predisposition and the environment raise the risk of early-onset cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teams like ours at the Cleveland Clinic are now trying to figure out which environmental factors contribute to the rise in colorectal cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has already provided theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review from the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14202563/colon-cancer-explosion-toxins-air-link.html"&gt;University of California San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; of more than 3,000 studies found that microplastics can accumulate in the colon and cause it to produce less mucus, a protective layer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the colon can't produce mucus, the intestinal walls can't protect against contaminants like microplastics and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mucus also lubricates the colon and helps stool pass easily. When stool builds up in the colon, it irritates the colon and inflames the inner lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, much of this territory is still uncharted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Am I at risk?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Besides environmental risk factors that still need to be identified, there are several known inherited conditions that predispose patients to colorectal cancer at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, about 15 to 20 percent of early-onset colorectal cases cases are attributed to hereditary conditions - those passed on through families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of these are related to Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs when genes involved in DNA repair - mismatch repair genes - mutate. This significantly raises the risk of cells in organs like the colon growing out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates one in 279 Americans has Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FAP, meanwhile, causes the growth of numerous polyps that almost always lead to early-onset cancer if left untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with a family history of these conditions, genetic testing and early and frequent screening, including colonoscopies, are critical in identifying and preventing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, risk-reducing surgeries, like removing parts or even all of the colon, may be the best prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A family history of colorectal cancer, especially when in a first-degree relative, even without a known hereditary condition, doubles your overall risk, so it's crucial to know your history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A known family history of colorectal cancer may prompt genetic testing and potentially life-saving screening colonoscopies, even if you're younger than 45, the current recommended screening age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer screened for and diagnosed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is crucial, as cancers detected in the early stages can often be cured with surgery alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, early-onset colorectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages because young people are more likely to ignore their symptoms or not be old enough for regular screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This complicates treatment and lowers survival rates. &lt;span&gt;When addressed early, the chances of successful treatment and cure are significantly higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news in recent decades has been thanks to screening tools like colonoscopies and at-home stool tests, colon cancer rates are down in people over 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alarmingly these important gains were accompanied by a rise in cases and deaths in young people that are still below the age of recommended screening examinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45, though this guideline fails to capture the growing number of patients in their 20s and 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At-home stool tests like Cologuard have also become increasingly popular, allowing people to take a sample of their stool and send it off to check for hidden blood for DNA changes, which could be a sign of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you get a positive stool test, you will likely still be referred for a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer treated?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treating young people with colon cancer requires special considerations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since hereditary conditions are more commonly found in young patients with cancer, any patient diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer should undergo genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnosing genetic conditions like Lynch syndrome or FAP can have significant implications not only for the patient but for their relatives, as it could prevent further cancers in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young patients with metastatic disease - meaning the cancer has spread to other areas - may benefit from aggressive treatment, including surgery to remove the primary tumor in the colon and also potential metastases in the liver or lung, but this must be balanced with a careful, individualized approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychological care is also an essential part of treatment, as cancer at a young age can have profound emotional and social impacts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be very difficult for people who are used to being the primary caregivers in their families, taking care of young children and aging parents, to suddenly require care to be given to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Financial toxicity, which refers to the high costs associated with cancer treatment, is another challenge faced by many young patients who frequently do not have sufficient savings and are dependent on regular paychecks to make ends meet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social work support is crucial in addressing these financial burdens and helping patients navigate the complexities of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, since some cancer treatments can affect reproductive and sexual health, it is critical for EOCRC patients to discuss their plans for childbearing with their cancer provider and be referred to fertility specialists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike many patients traditionally diagnosed with colon cancer, these patients are focused on expanding their families, and we want to make sure they have every opportunity to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of my team is to optimize the quality of life for cancer survivors and provide ongoing support tailored to their unique needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What's the takeaway?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset colorectal cancer presents a significant public health challenge, driven by complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing and reversing the rise of the disease in young people requires a deeper understanding of these influences and the implementation of personalized screening strategies, particularly for individuals with hereditary risks or a family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival, and patients and healthcare providers need to be vigilant to prevent delays in detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment must be tailored to the unique needs of younger patients through a multidisciplinary approach at expert centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As innovative research continues to shed light on the causes of colon cancer in young people, a more comprehensive patient- and population-centered approach will not only improve outcomes but also help reduce the overall impact of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is getting dramatically worse by the day and baffled medical professionals at America's top hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His illness hasn't just affected his body; it has also impacted his mental clarity and decision-making, he and his wife told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dating back to June of last year, he began feeling extremely fatigued almost all the time and had begun developing serious acne on his back. By January, he'd developed the first major sore on his leg, which started out red but soon morphed into a terrifying black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of Wednesday last week, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14491549/new-skin-disease-ravages-father-doctors-warning-pyoderma-gangrenosum.html"&gt;40 to 50 percent of his skin was covered in sores&lt;/a&gt;. In just the last several days, he has developed five more wounds on his stomach, at the top of his right arm, and on the palms of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first wound in January coincided with a major personality shift, according to Mikkel Becker, his wife of one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that time, he lost $25,000 of her retirement money by purchasing &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tesla/index.html" id="mol-864a33e0-0475-11f0-9899-c9616624572f"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; stock option contracts that went bust after 'Elon sent a tweet,' Ryan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Becker and his wife Mikkel are pictured with their kids at Disney World. Soon after this, he would get his first skin sore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Dermatologists believe Ryan, 38, has a never-before-seen form of pyoderma gangrenosum, a disorder that typically leaves sores only on the legs. He has developed sores on his arms, back, chest, stomach and even the on the palms of his hands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'January is when Ryan started to do dumb stuff he would never have done, like gambling my retirement [on a risky investment],' said Mikkel, who has a four-month-old baby named Atlas with Ryan. ‘Then that's the day that one of the first sores on his legs showed up.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dermatologists say their best guess is that Ryan, 38, has a never-before-seen form of pyoderma gangrenosum, a disorder that typically leaves sores only on the legs and is treatable with steroid therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But neither is true for Ryan. The sores have spread to nearly every corner of his body and doctors have not been able to find an effective form of treatment for him, even as he reports being in agony for large portions of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said his sores cause him 'burn victim level pain.' She added that nearly all the doctors they've seen have been shocked by his sheer number of ulcers and the severity of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Everywhere we go with Ryan, doctors are in shock, awe and horror. I mean, they can’t hide it on their faces. They're trained to not show any expression, but when they see Ryan, it's just like, “Oh my god,”’ Mikkel said, adding that they often go and get second, third and even fourth opinions from their colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He sought help at the Mayo Clinic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-4e84a940-047f-11f0-9af9-f5bacadcdf9c"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and a Johns Hopkins-affiliated hospital in Washington, D.C., but still remains without answers he desperately seeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although his prognosis is still unknown — given that pyoderma gangrenosum remains poorly understood by scientists — Johns Hopkins gave Ryan the grim prediction in February that he likely has six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan said his latest test results have led the heartbroken family to believe that he's going to die 'a slow, painful death.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no cases that any of the dermatologists that I've talked to that have seen it spread to the legs, the torso and the arms,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan's sores first show up as red marks on his skin. They then get raised and blister before popping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After that, the sores become necrotic, meaning its essentially a mass of dead skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And with each new sore that appears, he goes through the same grueling process each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So what happens is, they get red, they get raised, they blister, then they pop, then they go necrotic,’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When skin or any other tissue enters a 'necrotic' state, it essentially means that the cells have died due to a lack of blood flow. This is also when the skin turns dark black and almost looks like frost bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Necrosis can be extremely painful and &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection"&gt;presents with symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as a fever, sensations of 'crackling' under the skin, and brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan freely admits that in his case, it has gone far beyond brain fog or just normal confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though the first sores appeared in early January, it wasn't until early February when Mikkel realized it was time to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I woke up to him having a seizure in the bed. And I'm trying to stop him from hitting his head on the bed. And his hands are flailing everywhere and he, you know, accidentally punches me in the face,’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this time, he had also developed a chest wound 'in the shape of a heart,' Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan said he doesn’t remember that seizure at all, but Mikkel said he started having them during their family trip to Disney World from December 31 to January 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Becker is pictured in a hotel room ahead of his visit to the Mayo Clinic with his wife Mikkel and four-month-old baby Atlas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once at the Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, the couple said Ryan was loaded up with a massive cocktail of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say he was given corticosteroids intravenously, a treatment typically given to deal with inflammation. Experts also say that high doses of these types of steroids can lead to psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was definitely in a state of acute psychosis,' Ryan said. ‘I was like, “I must have murdered someone or something” … I thought all the nurses were involved in it, that it was a sting operation, that I was gonna go to sleep, and they were gonna arrest me. But then also, my parents were into organized crime.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel and Ryan both said he believed Mikkel was an FBI agent and that his stepdaughter Reagan was a CIA agent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, Ryan said he agreed to be given Dilaudid, an opioid weaker than fentanyl but stronger than morphine, and Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They kept me sleeping, at least I thought they did. Apparently, I sleep-walked,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over the last month, Ryan and Mikkel have been traveling around the country searching for a cure to his unusually aggressive disease. Their baby has been with them every step of the way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said that while she appreciated the doctors' efforts at the hospital in their home city, she fears their treatment was below what was needed given the severity of his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan and Mikkel thought their fortunes had turned around when the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota squeezed them in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to them, their arrival at the world-renowned health facility was the start of an entirely new nightmare when he wasn't taken seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple say doctors began making suggestions that weren't true, and it was briefly believed he was suffering from factitious disorder, better known as Munchausen syndrome, a condition where someone intentionally harms themselves to gain attention or affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They completely stopped treating me,' he said, which he said included heavily reducing his course of painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A resident said, "So we believe you've been using substances... and you're causing these wounds yourself. So, we're going to go ahead and discharge you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm like, "How in the world do you think I'm causing these wounds by scratching myself?"' Ryan recalled saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said they had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the misunderstanding corrected, and their version of events was solidified when Ryan's urine test came back negative for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan reports having extreme pain from the sores on his body as well as fatigue dating back to June of last year, before he even had any breakouts on his skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also said she had to repeatedly tell doctors that she was with her husband 24/7 and would know if his wounds were self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked about Ryan's experiences, the Mayo Clinic declined to comment, citing patient privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two weeks at the Mayo Clinic, the couple along with their baby got on another plane bound for Johns Hopkins Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital, which partners with the National Institute of Health's Undiagnosed Diseases Program, did not believe Ryan had factitious disorder or had a drug problem, the couple said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That much was a comfort, they said, but their trip to Johns Hopkins yielded no more answers to why Ryan's case of pyoderma gangrenosum is so unusually aggressive — or why he is one of the few patients with the disease who could die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's also no indication of what causes his sores to appear, though scientists who have studied the disease suspect it could be autoimmune-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uncertainty that surrounds every aspect of Ryan's fast-progressing disease is what spurred them to travel across the country to the top medical institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That has also had the downside of taking Ryan and Mikkel out of the workforce, which will threaten their access to their employer-sponsored health plans in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To deal with Ryan's ongoing medical bills, the family has set up a GoFundMe that has raised more than $33,000 so far&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan works as a commercial plans examiner for Spokane County. He was originally under the impression that he'd have to return full-time by April 1, otherwise, he'd have to pay roughly $3,000 per month for COBRA coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His job has since worked out a deal with him that it will keep his family's benefits intact through August as long as they contribute to the health plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan doesn't have only himself to worry about. He has six children ranging from a four-month-old son to a 17-year-old daughter who need health coverage too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of possibly losing coverage, he recently received an unexpected medical bill from the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sent Ryan a letter stating that his stay was not covered by his health insurance and that he would be responsible for his remaining balance of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan is afraid that Johns Hopkins will do the same thing, though he hasn't received any denial of coverage correspondence from them yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far, the family has raised more than $33,000 on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/RyanandKel"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Tuesday night, Ryan and Mikkel were on their way to Portland from their home in Spokane to see one of the world's foremost experts on pyoderma gangrenosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan and Mikkel are currently on their way to see Dr. Alex Ortega-Loayza (pictured) who is one of the world's foremost experts on pyoderma gangrenosum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Alex Ortega-Loayza is a dermatologist at the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University Hospital, where he assembled a team of scientists, biostatisticians, and clinicians to specifically study pyoderma gangrenosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan is scheduled to see Dr. Ortega this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, Ryan and Mikkel haven't lost their optimism or sense of humor, with the couple joking that he has 'zombie skin,' a fear he eerily predicted on his Bumble profile back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think we met on Bumble, right? He had on there, what's your greatest fear?’ Mikkel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And he said,’ Mikkel started before Ryan interjected, ‘to have a condition that causes a zombie apocalypse to be named after me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now he's like, “Oh my God, my skin is like zombie skin now!”’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When Catalonian &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas"&gt;Maria Branyas&lt;/a&gt; died in August 2024 at the grand old age of 117 years and 168 days, she was officially the world's oldest living person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine how Maria managed to collect so many birthdays, a team led by researchers from the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute in Spain conducted a comprehensive analysis on everything from her genes to her proteins to her microbiome to her metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their report, which is yet to be peer reviewed, provides a rare glimpse into the cellular machinery that just might give some of us a shot at starting a second centenary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg" alt="Maria at her 117th birthday" class="wp-image-155484 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maria blowing out candles at her 117th birthday. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas#/media/File:Maria_Branyas_Morera_(117%C3%A8_aniversari).jpg"&gt;Family archive of Maria Branyas Morera/Wikimedia Commons/PD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercentenarian"&gt;supercentenarian&lt;/a&gt; – someone who reaches the age of 110 or urpasses it – and it's quite an achievement. Only around 1 in 10 of the people who make it to a century of living then manage another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a host of different analytical techniques and interviews, the researchers found that Maria checked a lot of the recommended boxes when it came to longevity and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155398" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg" alt="Multiomics chart" class="wp-image-155398 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-600x598.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at multiple signs of aging. (Santos-Pujol et al., &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a mentally, socially, and physically active lifestyle, for instance, spending quality time with family and friends; all factors known to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;keep dementia at bay&lt;/a&gt;. Maria also ate well, sticking mostly to a Mediterranean-style diet that's been linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;to a longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the researchers noted was Maria's love of yogurt. The researchers think the supercentenarian's diet choices helped to encourage healthy gut bacteria – and indeed her gut microbiome had the characteristics of someone much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microorganisms are critical in determining not only the metabolite composition of our body, but also inflammation, intestinal permeability, cognition, and bone and muscle health," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in our DNA have long been considered critical in determining our mortality. Maria had genes associated with a stronger immune system, protection against heart disease, and a reduction in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-risk-of-cancer-could-fluctuate-even-born-youre-born"&gt;risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;; a chemical marking mechanism that affects how genes are expressed. Since this mechanism is influenced by stresses in the environment, it is often used to gauge the passing of life's trials in what's described as our biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Remarkably, all the distinct algorithms of age based on DNA methylation yielded the same result," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our supercentenarian exhibited a much younger biological age than her real chronological age and this occurred in the three different tissues analyzed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors highlighted by the researchers were Maria's highly efficient metabolism, leading to lower levels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-how-to-actually-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;of 'bad' cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of 'good' cholesterol, as well as low levels of inflammation (protecting against multiple health issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20250310/genetico-maria-branyas-117-anos-microbiota-nina/16484198.shtml"&gt;Maria herself&lt;/a&gt; put her long life down to an "orderly life and pleasant surroundings", but it's clear that there were multiple factors at work. While most of us won't reach 117, the research does help in understanding how the body can be given the best chance of aging without damage or disease – and from there improving our health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available on the preprint server &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;BioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"For as long as I can remember, every time I pee, my eyes tear up. I don’t mean just a little watery-eyed moment, I mean full-blown tears streaming down my face, sometimes even a runny nose. The longer I hold it, the worse it gets. I always assumed this happened to everyone. Growing up without the internet, there wasn’t exactly a way to fact-check my experience, and honestly, it never even crossed my mind to ask my family about it. It was just…normal. Then, one fateful day in high school, I hadn’t adjusted to my new schedule yet, so I went for two full class periods without a bathroom break. By the time I finally made it to the restroom, the floodgates (both kinds) opened. When I walked back into class, my friends looked alarmed."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“'Are you okay? Why were you crying?' one of them asked. Confused, I just shrugged. 'Oh, I wasn’t crying. I just really had to pee.' Apparently, this wasn’t a universal experience. No one in my friend group had any idea what I was talking about. In fact, they didn’t even believe me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and thanks to the internet, I now know this rare phenomenon is called Gustatory Lacrimation. It’s a quirky little glitch in the nervous system where the body gets its wires crossed, making my tear ducts go into overdrive when I relieve myself. If that’s not a completely useless superpower, I don’t know what is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brazil's bats are harboring a vast and diverse pool of coronaviruses, a new study finds, including a newly identified strain that may pose a danger to human health in the years to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are taking the threat seriously and will soon conduct testing in a secure lab to see if the variant really could spill over to our own species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The discovery is cause for concern because the strain is eerily reminiscent of the bat-borne virus behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) – a contagion that causes a very high case fatality rate of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8930171/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;nearly 35 percent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its identification in 2012, the MERS  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="155291" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; (MERS-CoV) has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers"&gt;caused 858 known deaths&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. While mild cases are likely underreported, this  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="155291" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; holds the&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_839_21"&gt; highest case fatality rate&lt;/a&gt; of all the known coronaviruses that can infect humans, making it the most lethal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For comparison, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS‑CoV‑2, has a human case fatality rate of around 2 percent, according to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_839_21"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155419" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155419" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-642x856.jpg" alt="Close Relative of Most Lethal Coronavirus Found in Brazil's Bats" class="wp-image-155419 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-642x856.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-311x415.jpg 311w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-600x800.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155419" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The great fruit-eating bat (&lt;em&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/em&gt;) can harbor the new MERS-like virus. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Great_fruit-eating_bat_held.jpg"&gt;Juan Cruzado Cortés/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists in Brazil and China discovered the close relative of MERS-CoV while testing 16 different bat species in Brazil for pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking more than 400 oral and rectal swabs from bats, the international team, led by Bruna Stefanie Silvério from the Federal University of São Paulo, identified seven distinct coronaviruses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These were harbored by just two species: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvety_free-tailed_bat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molossus molossus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (an insect-eater) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_fruit-eating_bat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a fruit bat).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one of the viral variants shares an evolutionary history with MERS-CoV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until now, members of the MERS-CoV family had only been documented in bats of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/10/13-0946_article"&gt;Africa, Europe, and the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This indicates that "closely related viruses are circulating in South American bats and expanding their known geographic range," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;according to the authors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Silvério et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have known that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;viruses found in bats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are a threat to human safety since long before the 2020 pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, became the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-70962-6_13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first pandemic transmissible disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 21st century to have an unknown origin. The fatality ratio of this viral outbreak reached &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00518.x"&gt;around 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the epidemic in June 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Later, researchers figured out that bats were a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/research/health-medical/diseases/infectious-diseases/bats-confirmed-host-of-sars-virus"&gt;&lt;span&gt;natural reservoir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for SARS-like coronaviruses, and after years of hard work, they confirmed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118391"&gt;SARS-CoV-1 spilled over&lt;/a&gt; from these wild mammals to ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2012, yet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/man-tests-positive-for-mers-cov-in-abu-dhabi-who-reports"&gt;&lt;span&gt;another deadly coronavirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; appeared on the scene. The MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia after most likely jumping from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000342"&gt;bats to camels&lt;/a&gt; to humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While this virus spreads less easily among our own species, travelers have carried the infection to the United States, Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a MERS-like strain in South America underscores the "&lt;span&gt;critical role bats play as reservoirs for emerging viruses," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Silvério and her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Right now we aren't sure it can infect humans, but we detected parts of the virus's spike protein [which binds to mammalian cells to start an infection] suggesting potential interaction with the receptor used by MERS-CoV," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076849"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Silvério. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To find out more, we plan to conduct experiments in Hong Kong during the current year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since 2020, the world has taken the threat of coronaviruses spilling over from wild mammals to humans &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-covid-like-virus-in-russian-bats-shows-resistance-to-vaccine-antibodies"&gt;&lt;span&gt;more seriously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than ever before. The discovery of a threatening bat-borne virus in South America is certainly concerning, but it's also a point of comfort. Now that we know it exists, scientists can keep a close eye on the threat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Bats are important viral reservoirs and should therefore be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076849"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; co-author Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, biologist at the Federal University of São Paulo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better the devil you know than the one you don't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Tuolumne County, CA—Tuolumne County Public Health (TCPH) is warning the public that it is investigating two suspected cases of measles involving Summerville High School and Adventist Health Sonora (AHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department cautions the public about potential exposure for anyone at the campus between Monday, March 10, and Tuesday, March 11, 2025, and at the hospital’s emergency room between the late evening of Saturday, March 15, and the early morning of Sunday, March 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an emerging situation; details are pending, and we will update the public as soon as further information is available,” stated health officials, adding, “As part of the investigation, Summerville High School is coordinating closely with public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Summerville Union High School District takes the health and safety of its students, staff, and our community seriously, and we will be working closely with Tuolumne County Public Health through the process of identifying any risk to our students, staff and community,” states Michael Merrill, superintendent of Summerville High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/local/3645030/safeguarding-against-measles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;As we reported here last week, California had five confirmed measles cases,&lt;/a&gt; and county health put out an alert to the public advising on the best way to protect against the highly infectious disease. In today’s press release they advise that exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms and confirm if their measles vaccination is up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unimmunized persons or those with unknown immunization status who were at these locations during the aforementioned dates and times are at risk of developing measles from 7 to 21 days after being exposed and should monitor for symptoms,” shared health officials, adding, “Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days after exposure are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH provided this list of what exposed individuals should do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles. People who have not had a measles infection or received the measles immunization previously may not be protected from the measles virus and should talk with a healthcare provider about receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) or Proquad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• If symptoms develop, they should isolate at home and avoid contact with others. Talk to their healthcare provider. Call ahead of their visit to a healthcare facility and make them aware of their measles exposure and symptoms. Public health can assist healthcare providers in appropriately diagnosing and managing your care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles up to four days before a rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears. Measles is an airborne illness that can infect others when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. Health officials stress that the virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for many hours, even after the infected person has left. If others breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, they can become infected. Young children and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for life-threatening complications from infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH provided these common symptoms of measles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• High fever (higher than 101°F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Cough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Runny nose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Red and watery eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most health insurance covers the cost of vaccines, according to TCPH, noting that being vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella with the MMR or MMRV vaccines is the strongest defense against this disease. The MMRV also guards against varicella or chickenpox. If taken in two doses, they are 97 percent effective. That drops to 93 percent if just one dose is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If 95% of the population has received both doses of the vaccine, the transmission of measles within the community can be stopped,” stress TCPH officials.&lt;/p&gt;

The individual was likely exposed at a location visited by the first case while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles manifests in a cough, fever, runny nose, watery eyes, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549793/" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549793/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt; and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still zero reported cases of measles in Oregon for this year, but this can change quickly. Oregon Health Authority (OHA) encouraged people to make sure they are protected against measles as 12 states including California, Texas and New Mexico, have reported measles cases since Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Oregon recorded 31 confirmed cases, its highest measles count in more than 30 years, during an outbreak among unvaccinated people, including two children younger than 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has reported 301 cases. 279 confirmed cases of measles have been reported in Texas, 33 in New Mexico, five in California, two in Alaska and Pennsylvania, one case in Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Vermont, and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is an amazingly contagious virus that unfortunately in recent years has re-emerged in our communities, primarily due to a declining percentage of people who are getting vaccinated,” said Paul Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at OHA’s Public Health Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection for individuals who haven’t received immunity through the MMR vaccine,” said Dawn Nolt, M.D., M.P.H., professor of pediatrics (infectious diseases) in the OHSU School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Senators urge HHS to launch national measles vaccination campaign amid outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Lewis, Health Officer for the Snohomish County Health Department, emphasized the importance of vaccination.

The disease is preventable with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is about 97% effective with two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, OHA bolstered its tracking of communicable diseases, such as measles, with the development of data reporting tools such as this interactive &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/shared/6ZBNT7D8Q?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/shared/6ZBNT7D8Q?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;dashboard &lt;/a&gt;that visualizes data on communicable disease incidence in Oregon. The dashboard’s data are disease, month, demographic group and county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that we have a highly safe and effective vaccine – it is our strongest line of defense and the best way to keep yourself, your children and your community safe. If you have questions about the vaccine, we encourage you to talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns.” said Dr. Nolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to studies, in a room full of people exposed to measles, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" target="_blank" title="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; who are unvaccinated will develop the disease. In addition, it can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in healthy people, measles can cause the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, but fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behavioral and intellectual deterioration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures that generally develop 7 to 10 years after measles infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) has reported that 95 percent of active measles cases are in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:39:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORE0wSWZHcmx6OERXeHFmTHhXSWQtb2RPVVU3cTBlcUZnLTQwVEV4akFjVDU0Zk1Yb3Bac1JWeDlWWFVsNG0zVVpKek5Eb0V3d2tvSmd3OWFHOFBNUHJxeVVOOFpjZGtBZmFqZ0pkUGd3OGl6MnhXaTZWSy02NFdLek9RMDFTSmozQ3Q5QjUtWDFXa3NBVklmUThFTWVPQTBpaU5hUWpn</guid></item><item><title>Only 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPMFVPd25HQzk2dWlvV1ctc0R0YmxRSmFvMlhPa2FBbjdyR3lCeE1rdHF5b0hXQmJ4RjJHSFlaQ2Z6R192U1JUM3QxRDM3QThMcU5KT1FtdEJ0WnJsd05pWHlCT0s0VlNUZWxPbE4tWXBLbWpGYUNhU1N6R1NlLUE1S0d2dTd6RDRzM1V4Q0RDT2hVNmlfdjM1TW1TNHFuXzNTQi1sMFVkSFp6S2NKVFpiTVlpR2JNMFl4enZXQjhZSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Most treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Six in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point.

The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Australian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain. Our review did not find reliable evidence of large effects for any of the included treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The one treatment that does help those with acute low-back pain is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they found. In addition, five treatments also bring some relief for chronic low-back pain: exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, &lt;a href="https://www.neuromusculartaping.com/clarifying-the-differences-between-various-taping-techniques-in-rehabilitation-nmt/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;taping&lt;/a&gt;, antidepressants and what are known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TPRV1) drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But three treatments for acute back pain do not work – exercise, glucocortisoid injections and taking paracetamol. And two for chronic back pain are also ineffective – antibiotics and anaesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the evidence for the other 45 treatments is “inconclusive”. The researchers assessed and offered a judgement on the extent to which they all relieved pain. Despite some of them being very popular, most “may provide modest reductions in pain”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Interventions that “probably provide little to no difference in pain” include exercise, paracetamol, glucocortisoid injections, anaesthetics and antibiotics or antimicrobial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, having a massage, taking painkillers and wearing foot orthotics “may provide” large reductions in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Heat, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;TENS&lt;/a&gt;) may produce a “moderate” reduction in pain. Osteopathic treatment and using muscle relaxants and NSAIDs together may produce a small lessening of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, two treatments may increase someone’s pain, including extracorporeal shockwaves and the anti-inflammatory drug &lt;a href="https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/colchicine/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said that family doctors often refer patients with back pain for physiotherapy as a first-line treatment, to be assessed and given exercises to perform, or to link workers, who suggest non-medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Many patients do report feeling some relief from the interventions – medical or not – that we suggest,” Hawthorne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tim Button, the president of the British Chiropractic Association, welcomed the study’s endorsement of spinal manipulation and taping as effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Our members are increasingly seeing patients come to them with back pain, worried that they can’t work and stuck on NHS waiting lists,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“While this may not always be a &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;miracle cure&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt; to chronic musculoskeletal conditions, it is as effective as other non-invasive treatments and makes a real difference to how quickly people can get back to work and normal life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A Chartered Society of Physiotherapy spokesperson said: “Physiotherapists carry out an in-depth assessment to identify the root causes of back pain, which will be different for everyone and can range widely from stress, fear of movement and poor sleep to smoking, obesity, job-related strain, and insufficient physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Exercise has been shown to be the most helpful treatment for back pain. Hands-on treatments have been shown to have a small benefit to back pain, but only when used as part of a whole treatment programme, which includes exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Similarly, injections may be beneficial as part of a treatment programme, but not on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPMFVPd25HQzk2dWlvV1ctc0R0YmxRSmFvMlhPa2FBbjdyR3lCeE1rdHF5b0hXQmJ4RjJHSFlaQ2Z6R192U1JUM3QxRDM3QThMcU5KT1FtdEJ0WnJsd05pWHlCT0s0VlNUZWxPbE4tWXBLbWpGYUNhU1N6R1NlLUE1S0d2dTd6RDRzM1V4Q0RDT2hVNmlfdjM1TW1TNHFuXzNTQi1sMFVkSFp6S2NKVFpiTVlpR2JNMFl4enZXQjhZSQ</guid></item><item><title>Pet food sold in WA recalled after link to bird flu - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUHhfUWlfNVNQRUt2OS1OemoxUkFRbzRmdkxLQTROdG5CTGpjd1VRTzZkMmo0eFZnWHF2dTU2c2dSbkFGZ3ItdmF6c3dnSXRaenBfMFVTS3hUQmdEUGlraUIxSURvVEF4ZTVMVHJCWFBheHp1bjl3YWVNbTlNQ1JyTkJVbjdvX3dYLXJCVzNLd2F4U3lMdlctc0l4ZmN5WThBSlpFRW5xTzMyc0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUHhfUWlfNVNQRUt2OS1OemoxUkFRbzRmdkxLQTROdG5CTGpjd1VRTzZkMmo0eFZnWHF2dTU2c2dSbkFGZ3ItdmF6c3dnSXRaenBfMFVTS3hUQmdEUGlraUIxSURvVEF4ZTVMVHJCWFBheHp1bjl3YWVNbTlNQ1JyTkJVbjdvX3dYLXJCVzNLd2F4U3lMdlctc0l4ZmN5WThBSlpFRW5xTzMyc0U?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Pet food sold in WA recalled after link to bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9CS1dmSDNHWGNGU0F3a2tjYjdfTFdGZmVtTThBckRYNEpzY1RxVW8tTjE3VUliSUFNcmNXbnlvT2FvUzFKQXhad0pHUHRLbC05MGxjNjE0TENzV1NEdlVpUDJ5LXNwT1ZqOU9aQ1duTWVqUWdoRE5KUUx30gFYQVVfeXFMUDdKdUlNNWd6VWpWZWxfckRLNTUwa0IySHhTdklMbjh1NWhQM3k1dG1YenJPQnJ2UVVYeGkzN3htRWpxS241UWpDaUxWODN6WDBQTDY4TTFndg?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;The FDA Has Issued a Recall on Some Raw Cat Food — Here Are Some to Try Instead&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;NBC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNVXYwN2dxT3pOaVhBR1hzT3VzM3dCOXM4LXZoNHN5N1NTaTR2OHVkRThHRVpwYjZ0UzNFMlIyMWZRc2hRSnE2ZTlQWXJzWUdIdlpSUmI3bU04TTRzUm5PcTI4THhPMmgwTFN1alJRMC0tdjIzd1JBTTUySVY5QTZWU2hjTFBPZ2M?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Bird Flu Kills 2 Pet Cats in New York City, Officials Say&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNREtJVkRwZXoxUVMxakJReEQ4X1RPa3piOFI0a0h1aDY2WXc1UnVjME53ZnhaNUpvQkVPY001MElYUjhfVDRVZHpRZlpxRWJ4LWx0eHIyTklZZzNuZlI4UG5TMW5qRzB4Zm82eE1UTHZoUWZ3ODJIcU1NNXVLU0lWNVd1V3NwNm9haVNZdXNn?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Cat food products recalled for bird flu risk: Here’s which products are affected&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9CcEJJZzJrUnZKeVk2UXN0Z3RkTEkyUzQ0YVhaVDRqQkRxdEI5cFlpdFdzcmdSS0M1cXlwWlBuOHZKX1pmN04zTkZsT3l2WmNGYXdLemFvOUFnRjExX0N6RVVoaUc1dFYyWlRIelUzbjk?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Another raw pet food recall is tied to illness and death in cats&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 22:48:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUHhfUWlfNVNQRUt2OS1OemoxUkFRbzRmdkxLQTROdG5CTGpjd1VRTzZkMmo0eFZnWHF2dTU2c2dSbkFGZ3ItdmF6c3dnSXRaenBfMFVTS3hUQmdEUGlraUIxSURvVEF4ZTVMVHJCWFBheHp1bjl3YWVNbTlNQ1JyTkJVbjdvX3dYLXJCVzNLd2F4U3lMdlctc0l4ZmN5WThBSlpFRW5xTzMyc0U</guid></item><item><title>Delegates drop religious, philosophical exemptions from vaccine bill; boost medical exemptions - West Virginia MetroNews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQUTdpU3Y2dUhDekc5dGQwZFgxRUVPRzViNkFsYUIzZmFEaEFnSDE0ajkwWFB0dTVxTnJVc3BQTU5kTi1wQWY0U3R3emJ3aTM3N3RGYmpQdzR1NlhRdnlfV05QSlRzRVpuOV9ZLV9RcUlXWVl0aTNyQk9YWnpITXVQYUdPT002MUoxemZhNk1YLXMyVWZSUjRad1FCN1RCVUY5VkN1eVExdUxyenNUN25qOXczYTMwUTk0QTc1dmZxaFBOanlfT0dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The House Health Committee changed a hot-button bill on school vaccination requirements to focus on exemptions for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_614828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-614828" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-614828" src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-100x150.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-233x350.jpg 233w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-100x150.jpg 100w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-614828" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Chris Anders&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, if I reading the amendment correctly, for clarification, it removes philosophical and religious exemptions. Am I correct?” asked Delegate Chris Anders, R-Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of members of the House Health and Human Resources Committee voted to make key changes to a bill that came over from the Senate. And then a majority of the committee members, 18-7, took another vote to advance a bill reflecting those changes to the full House of Delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it is a very different bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the legislative session began, Gov. Patrick Morrisey called for policies allowing for religious exemptions to school vaccination requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all states except California, Mississippi, and West Virginia allow religious or philosophical exemptions for school vaccines, granting parents the ability to opt their children out of vaccinations based on sincerely held beliefs.&lt;span class="pjBG2e" data-cid="3ea2bf28-7111-40fb-a5b6-e06eefa56441"&gt;&lt;span class="UV3uM"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, West Virginia students entering school for the first time &lt;a href="https://oeps.wv.gov/immunizations/Documents/school/New_School_Entry.pdf"&gt;must show proof&lt;/a&gt; of immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B unless properly medically exempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state Senate, nearly a month ago, overwhelmingly passed &lt;a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=460&amp;amp;year=2025&amp;amp;sessiontype=RS"&gt;SB 460,&lt;/a&gt; which at that point would have allowed religious or philosophical exemptions if parents or legal guardians object on legal grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill got hung up in the House of Delegates as members worked to determine what could actually pass. During that time, the state Department of Health &lt;a href="https://dhhr.wv.gov/News/2025/Pages/Department-of-Health-Issues-Alert-After-West-Virginians-Potentially-Exposed-to-Measles-at-Dulles-Airport.aspx"&gt;issued an advisory&lt;/a&gt; that some West Virginians could have been exposed to measles carried by a traveler at Dulles Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Anders told members of the committee that he does not like the changes to the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a free people. We are not subjects of the state. Government does not own our bodies or our children’s bodies. This amendment is a direct assault on freedom, parental rights. It is unacceptable if we allow the government to mandate this, we surrender the very essence of liberty itself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_614829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-614829" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-614829 size-thumbnail" src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters-100x150.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters-100x150.jpg 100w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-614829" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ian Masters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, said he would have preferred religious and philosophical exemptions in the bill. But he spoke in favor of the bill’s emphasis on medical exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While I too may have liked this, though, to come out stronger, I think what we’re actually accomplishing here is fixing a medical exemption that essentially doesn’t exist,” Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_562605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-562605" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-562605 size-thumbnail" src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2024/03/YgOBdOyR-hite_michael-100x150.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-562605" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Michael Hite&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, made a similar point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether or not we wanted religious or philosophical exceptions or not is irrelevant at this point,” Hite said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This bill shores up the medical exemptions that we heard testimony in here that that weren’t happening, that were needed and that there were issues with and I think this bill has strengthened those medical exemptions to make sure that those people who testified in this committee will get the exemptions that they need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_500541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-500541" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-500541" src="https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-100x150.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-200x300.jpg 200w, https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-233x350.jpg 233w, https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-100x150.jpg 100w, https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-500541" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mike Pushkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, voted in favor of making the changes to the bill and then voted against passing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s better than it was, but it’s still very dangerous,” Pushkin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushkin later said West Virginia leads the nation in protections against the spread of infectious disease — and should fight to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing positive that we lead the nation in is some of our public health laws in regards to childhood immunization, and you’re not hearing of these types of outbreaks, whether it’s measles or Rubella or all the things that are starting to make a comeback in other states that have weakened their laws,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re not hearing about it here. I’d like to keep it that way. I’m a strong no on even this is a better bill than what we have, but it’s still, why are we messing with something that’s working?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

						Ohio health officials provided an update on the nationwide measles outbreak Tuesday.Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health, hosted the press conference, along with Dr. Matthew Washam, an infections disease doctor at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.Officials discussed the outbreak while stressing the importance of parents keeping up to date with their children's vaccinations on the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vanderhoff said the MMR vaccine is highly effective and safe."The recommended two dose regimen for children has been proven to be 97% effective at protecting against measles, and we also know it is very safe," Vanderhoff said. "There have been some spurious claims in the past that the vaccine is connected to autism, but those claims have been debunked and there is no evidence of a connection."The percentage of students who were up to date on the MMR fell from 89.2 percent in the 2023-24 school year to 88.3 percent in the most recent school year.Measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months."You can get measles literally by just being in a room where a person with measles has been recently," Vanderhoff said. "This can happen even up to two hours after the person has left."Late last month, Kentucky health officials confirmed an adult had tested positive for the virus, in FrankfortAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 301 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, March 13, in 15 states. This year, there have been no reported cases in Indiana or Ohio.

"This can happen even up to two hours after the person has left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month, Kentucky health officials &lt;a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/kentucky-measles-case-frankfort-virus-doctors/63944983" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed an adult had tested positive for the virus&lt;/a&gt;, in Frankfort&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;301 cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as of Thursday, March 13, in 15 states. This year, there have been no reported cases in Indiana or Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, said the outbreak is still growing, with capacity to transmit both locally and further afield through spread to pockets of unvaccinated individuals. Though the response teams have been stressing the importance of vaccination, uptake of vaccines “has definitely been a struggle,” Wells said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be a large outbreak. And we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we’re still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,” Wells said during a press conference organized by the Big Cities Health Coalition, a forum for leaders of metropolitan health departments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long in order to get through this entire outbreak,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If the outbreak lasts for longer than 12 months, the United States would lose its status as a country that has achieved &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles elimination&lt;/a&gt;. Measles-free status means that all cases are either contracted abroad, or linked to spread from someone who has been infected elsewhere. If that ensuing transmission continues for more than a year, however, the virus would be deemed to be endemic again in the country. The U.S. achieved measles elimination status in 2000, but came close to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/04/measles-outbreaks-put-u-s-at-risk-of-losing-prized-elimination-status/"&gt;losing that status in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when a long-running outbreak in New York City and surrounding counties continued for close to a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed 279 cases, though that number is undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/12/measles-outbreak-larger-than-reported-public-health-experts-say/"&gt;an underestimate&lt;/a&gt;. There are now cases reported in 11 counties in Texas, with the epicenter of the outbreak in rural west Texas, in a community of Mennonites who do not vaccinate their children. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Only two&lt;/a&gt; of the confirmed cases in Texas have had the recommended two doses of measles-targeting vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date Texas has recorded one death in this outbreak, in an unvaccinated school-aged child. New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has recorded 38 cases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;one death&lt;/a&gt;, in an unvaccinated adult. Oklahoma has reported &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/osdh-reports-additional-measles-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, all in unvaccinated individuals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That evidence of spread underscores the challenges public health faces in bringing the outbreak under control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just think that it being so rural, now multi-state, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work, to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though efforts to increase vaccination rates among the most affected communities are not meeting with substantial success, Wells said in Lubbock about 300 more doses than normally would be administered have been given in the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mixed messaging about the best way to combat measles could be contributing to the difficulties in bringing the outbreak to a close, suggested Phil Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Neither Huang nor the other public health officials at the press conference referenced Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. directly in their remarks. And at a point, Huang sidestepped a question about whether Kennedy — a long-time critic of vaccines, particularly the measles, mumps and rubella shot — was undermining the effort to persuade parents of unvaccinated children to get them vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In interviews and&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt; a commentary published on the Fox News site&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy has stressed treatment of measles over prevention of the disease, urging the use of vitamin A and cod liver oil. While vitamin A has been shown to improve survival of malnourished children in developing countries when they contract measles, it is in no way a preventive measure. Although it is common practice in measles outbreaks for public health leaders to stress the importance of vaccination, Kennedy has said the decision of whether to vaccinate is down to parental choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that we really depend on … is a consistent message, really, from all levels,” Huang said. “All of us, from the highest level down to the ground level need to be reinforcing that message about the importance of vaccines and that vaccines are the way we prevent this and are going to address this, and need to address this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And we do have some concerns when some other messages might dilute that message.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simbo Ige, Chicago’s commissioner of public health, spoke of the struggles her department faced last year during a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that began in a migrant shelter in the city. Over the course of the outbreak, 30,000 doses of vaccine were administered, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin A was not the reason why we got to [measles] elimination. It was the vaccination,” Ige said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pussycat Dolls alum Jessica Sutta was left with debilitating medical issues after getting a vaccine for COVID-19. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pussycat Dolls alum Jessica Sutta sustained a debilitating injury after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The singer, 42, said she began experiencing horrific symptoms just days after receiving her second dose of the Moderna vaccine in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I woke up with a muscle spasm in my right rib that just would not get out,” she recalled during&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14491779/pussycat-dolls-covid-vaccine-injuries-jessica-sutta.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; an interview with Daily Mail published Tuesday.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It felt like a knife inside was burning. It wrapped around my rib cage and up and down my spine, and it felt like I was on the brink of death.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The singer discussed her painful symptoms from the Moderna vaccine in an interview with Daily Mail.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta said she started experiencing spasms and muscle pain just days after getting her second dose of the vaccine in 2021.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sutta, who started experiencing spasms and tremors in her legs, said that she feels like her body has been “completely hijacked.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pop star shared that she was left bed-bound and unable to dance for more than a few minutes at a time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any physical activity I pay for the next day, and my body just flares, and it’s very disappointing because I love to dance. It’s who I am,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “Don’t Cha” artist (seen here in 2011) felt like she was “on the brink of death.”  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WireImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta (seen here in 2024) also lost a ton of weight. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sutta struggled with chronic fatigue, muscle pain and extreme weight loss, dropping a staggering 50 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It felt like my body was eating itself,” she said. “And you can imagine living in Hollywood, you lose a lot of weight after you have a baby, and it’s, like, the best thing to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms took a toll on her personal life and she had trouble caring for her 3-year-old son M.J.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s times where I can’t lift him. I can’t put him in the car, I need someone to help me,” she said of her son, who was just a newborn when she started feeling symptoms. “There’s days that I can’t get out of bed, and I’m on the heating pad, and there’s so much mom guilt that just overflows from my entire being.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeking answers, Sutta attended a roundtable discussion where other people expressed having similar symptoms. She also connected with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during his 2024 presidential campaign and spoke out about her symptoms on her own platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta (seen here with her Pussycat Dolls bandmates in 2006) had trouble taking care of her young son due to her pain.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “Buttons” singer (seen here in 2019) ended up being diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus seven months ago.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m willing to risk my reputation so this doesn’t happen to anyone else,” Sutta said. “There are many people in the industry way, bigger than me with a bigger outreach, with vaccine injuries. But they won’t speak out. And for me, I just couldn’t hold my tongue.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sutta emphasized that she does believe in the technology but will no longer “blindly trust” the medical system after what she has gone through. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m not ‘anti’ anything. I’m just anti being sick,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While doctors initially thought Sutta had multiple sclerosis and dismissed concerns that her pain was caused by the vaccine, she finally got some answers seven months ago when she was diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta (seen here in 2002) shut down the claim that she is an anti-vaxxer.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I’m not ‘anti’ anything. I’m just anti being sick,” Sutta (seen here in 2023) said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The autoimmune condition is caused by the body’s response to a vaccine going rogue and producing cells that attack healthy tissue. The subsequent inflammation explained Sutta’s skin rashes, joint pain, muscle soreness and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis helped Sutta’s doctors figure out a more effective treatment and she now uses steroids to control her flareups. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I still get the muscle spasms here and there,'” Sutta said. “Things have gotten a little bit better through therapies and steroids, but I don’t want to live my life like that. I just want my body back. I want to be able to dance again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Don’t Cha” artist also takes a lupus medication called hydroxychloroquine and she monitors her diet by avoiding gluten and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The pop star (seen here in 2024 with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 2024) decided to speak up so she could help others struggling.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She now manages her symptoms with steroids, medications and a strict diet.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But even after all of this, even though I’m having a better day today, I don’t feel like myself anymore,” she said. “My heart just breaks for everyone who has suffered long COVID because they understand. You’re just not yourself anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suttan, who believes she was going to die within the first six months of her health struggles, said she is more optimistic these days that she will “persevere through this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am going to conquer this. And that’s my message to other vaccine-injured [people] going through what I’m going through: don’t give up,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak impacting Texas and New Mexico has now exceeded 300 cases, surpassing the number of measles cases reported in all of the U.S. last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the latest update from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), 279 measles cases have been reported in the state. In neighboring New Mexico, 38 cases have been confirmed as of Tuesday, totaling 317 cases across both states.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In all of 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 285 cases nationally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cases have primarily occurred in Gaines County, Texas, and Lea County, N.M., which sit opposite each other on the Texas-New Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been two deaths, one in each state, related to the current measles outbreak, and both occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. The death in Texas was directly attributed to measles, while the cause of death for the New Mexican individual, who tested positive for the virus, is still being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the cases in Texas, 36 have resulted in hospitalizations, while two people have been hospitalized in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious respiratory viral illnesses, with one infected individual capable of infecting nine out of 10 unvaccinated people they encounter. There are no antivirals or treatments specifically indicated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, there have been three confirmed outbreaks of measles in the U.S. so far in 2025, with 93 percent of cases linked to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Two full doses of a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is 97 percent effective against measles and only needs to be done once in a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As DSHS emphasized in its update, it takes 14 days after vaccination for the body to develop an immunity to measles, and it is only at that point at which someone is considered fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to shed light on the molecular differences between directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD and could pave the way for changes in how the disorders are treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, patients with directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD are treated the same way – with a combination of therapy and medication,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Timothy Jarome,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the project’s principal investigator and associate professor of neurobiology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that indirect trauma and direct trauma create different biological responses, which could mean they require different treatment strategies that target distinct brain pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Understanding how observation leads to PTSD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarome’s research focuses on understanding the neurobiological mechanisms behind memory-related disorders, including PTSD, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. His interest in bystander PTSD arose after learning about PTSD symptoms reported in people who witnessed the deadly 2021 collapse of a Miami condominium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who saw it from across the street reported that they were suffering from nightmares, insomnia, and anxiety,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were showing symptoms of PTSD, but didn’t go through it or have any connection to the people in the building. We sought out to understand the brain mechanisms behind how that occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers focused on protein changes caused by a fear stimulus in three key brain regions involved in fear memory: the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex. They discovered that witnessing trauma triggered distinct protein degradation patterns in all three regions, compared to directly experiencing trauma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they uncovered sex-specific differences in how male and female brains process indirect fear memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings build on previous research from Jarome’s lab, which identified a specific protein, known as K-63 ubiquitin, linked to PTSD development in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight significant biological differences in how male and female brains respond to witnessing trauma,” said the paper’s lead author, Shaghayegh Navabpour, a former Ph.D. student in translational biology, medicine, and health who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These differences may help explain why women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, leading to more targeted treatments that consider these sex-specific factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, Jarome hopes to explore how these how these molecular pathways could be leveraged to develop more precise PTSD therapies. He also hopes to examine the role of empathy, which originates in a different brain region called the anterior insular cortex, in bystander PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The vital role of student researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by a $420,000 grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to supporting equipment and materials costs of the research, the grant helped pay the stipends of graduate and undergraduate research assistants on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At academic institutions, students — undergraduate, graduate, and postdocs — are the driving force for research,” Jarome said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While faculty members might secure the funding to do the projects, the reality is that the work is done by these students as they’re going through their training. Without graduate students, especially, but also undergraduates and postdocs, science doesn’t advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navabpour, who earned her Ph.D. from Virginia Tech in 2023, is now working at Stanford to develop a drug to help treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My time in Dr. Jarome’s lab was hugely valuable in shaping my career and preparing me for my current role as a postdoc and my goal of becoming a faculty member,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned how to think scientifically — how to ask the right questions and approach problems critically — and gained hands-on experience with key methods and techniques that continue to inform my research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b9bfb5a7bcb6a1a6ba94a2a0fab1b0a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Margaret Ashburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Margaret Ashburn – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct, sex-specific molecular signatures from directly acquired fear memories&lt;/a&gt;” by Timothy Jarome et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct, sex-specific molecular signatures from directly acquired fear memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that affects women more than men. About 30% of patients suffering from PTSD develop the disorder by witnessing a traumatic event happen to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the focus has remained on those directly experiencing the traumatic event, whether indirectly acquired fear memories that underlie PTSD have the same molecular signature as those that are directly acquired remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using a rodent indirect fear learning paradigm where one rat (observer) watches another rat (demonstrator) associate an auditory cue with foot shock, we found that fear can be indirectly acquired by both males and females regardless of the sex or novelty (familiarity) of the demonstrator animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, behaviorally, indirectly acquired fear responses resemble those of pseudoconditioning, a behavioral response that is thought to not represent learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, using unbiased proteomics, we found that indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct protein degradation profiles in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to directly acquired fear memories and pseudoconditioning, which further differed significantly by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Egr2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;c-fos&lt;/em&gt; expression in the retrosplenial cortex of observer animals resembled that of demonstrator rats but was significantly different than that of pseudoconditioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings reveal that indirectly acquired fear memories have sex-specific molecular signatures that differ from those of directly acquired fear memories or pseudoconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data have important implications for understanding the neurobiology of indirectly acquired fear memories that may underlie bystander PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5hZ2ZxdnRLNklvS1lOM3V5TFJaNngyYURhUGl0aVBYSGZ2Y1VGUlFwWkl3Q01kNndSN0g0R3ZLZ2pUZTRmRW1ydWpSc1VrVWhVdzRSaWNkSzE0anROQmhmcUQ5TVl6SHdER3J6NHNRTy0</guid></item><item><title>Verbal Fluency Might Predict Human Longevity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9BdXNlWVJXTjdsb0hzdmJCRmRvT1RoT2ZjYVd0V3g2UUVTLTFVc056bExnaFg4cndyMlQ5ZTVrd0pGTGdDZDRNMEMyWHlEd1J1UG1SNUd6bURtMDZaTkw3MzJidWJXQTRhTnBGbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A recent study reveals a surprising link between longevity and verbal fluency—the ability to effectively recall and utilize vocabulary. Researchers analyzed cognitive data from the Berlin Aging Study, involving over 500 elderly participants tracked for nearly two decades, assessing verbal fluency alongside memory, perceptual speed, and verbal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these cognitive traits, verbal fluency emerged as the strongest predictor of longevity, indicating that individuals with sharper linguistic abilities tend to live longer. This finding suggests verbal fluency might serve as a marker of broader cognitive and physical well-being, highlighting the intricate connection between mental acuity and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbal Fluency &amp;amp; Longevity:&lt;/strong&gt; Among various cognitive traits tested, verbal fluency alone showed a significant link to increased lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; The study analyzed data collected over 18 years from 516 elderly participants in the Berlin Aging Study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Cognitive Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Verbal fluency likely serves as an indicator of broader health and cognitive function, including memory and mental agility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;APS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone ages, but, sometimes, people outlive all predictions. Previous research has uncovered an unlikely factor related to longevity: intelligence (Bäckman &amp;amp; MacDonald, 2006; Bosworth &amp;amp; Siegler, 2002).  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, intelligence isn’t a simple characteristic. There are many traits that contribute to it that can be tested—from memory to mathematical logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108165"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man and words." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Following that theory, verbal fluency would be a good measure of well-being, Ghisletta explained, because it’s a complex process that relies on multiple cognitive abilities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science &lt;/em&gt;study, Paolo Ghisletta of the University of Geneva linked longevity specifically to one of those traits: verbal fluency, the measure of one’s vocabulary and ability to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghisletta’s research used samples from the Berlin Aging Study, which started collecting data shortly before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 (Baltes &amp;amp; Mayer, 1999). It tracked 516 people aged 70 to 105 from enrollment to their death, over as long as 18 years in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured factors like dental health, stress levels, and economic well-being, as well as cognition. This makes it a “rich and rare data set,” said Ghisletta in an interview.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, researchers sampled nine different cognitive tests to understand if different aspects of intelligence might be more closely linked to longevity than others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests measured four cognitive abilities: verbal fluency, perceptual speed, verbal knowledge, and episodic memory. Perceptual speed is a measure of one’s ability to compare, scan, or perform pattern-assessing tasks with visual cues quickly. Verbal knowledge is a measure of one’s vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory is a measure of one’s ability to recall and remember personal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these categories was measured with several tests. One of the tests, for instance, measured verbal fluency by requiring participants to name as many animals as they could within 90 seconds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiling data on the different cognitive skills, Ghisletta and his team incorporated information about how the participants’ performance changed and estimated their risk of dying over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then developed a model that related the observed changes to risk of death. This required input from researchers across multiple universities with expertise in a type of data analysis called joint multivariate longitudinal survival model.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, it’s gotten much easier to do this kind of research because there are more data available. There are more people who are willing to collaborate. There are better tools,” Ghisletta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying these novel tools, the researchers discovered that verbal fluency alone seemed to be significantly linked to longevity, though the explanation behind this connection is not clear.  One popular theory, Ghisletta explained, is that the physical body is inextricably linked to mental, emotional, and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these domains are just declining together, whether it’s cognition, personality, emotions, or biological, medical decline in general,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that theory, verbal fluency would be a good measure of well-being, Ghisletta explained, because it’s a complex process that relies on multiple cognitive abilities. This might include long-term memory, vocabulary, efficiency, and visual memory. So, when you’re testing your verbal fluency, “you are doing something very interesting,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research answers questions that Ghisletta has had since his time as a postdoctoral researcher in the 1990s. But it only became possible to perform analyses of this sort recently.

It could be a sign your coworker has had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14414417/Plastic-surgeons-reveal-incredible-Midwest-Makeover-transformations-hail-new-subtle-surgery-craze.html"&gt;secret plastic surgery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in four Americans now report getting cosmetic work, ranging from &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fillers/index.html" id="mol-1489b960-fa07-11ef-9294-253ed660bbdb"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/botox/index.html" id="mol-14be36e0-fa07-11ef-9294-253ed660bbdb"&gt;Botox&lt;/a&gt; to a face lift or nose job. It was fewer than one in 100 in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And plastic surgeons have told the Daily Mail that with modern techniques, high-quality procedures are virtually 'unnoticeable' to the untrained eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We spoke with three top surgeons who revealed the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14499279/Plastic-surgeon-challenged-guess-procedures-strangers-YOU-subtle-signs.html"&gt;remarkably subtle signs&lt;/a&gt; a colleague, relative or loved one has indulged in a secret touch up...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;'Pixie' or 'bat' ears&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeons have speculated that Nicole Kidman may have had a face lift due to her 'pixie ears.' She has denied going under the knife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, there are two types of ear lobes: free and attached. While attached ear lobes are directly connected to the head, free ones are floppy and hang down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if your colleague's ear lobes are overly stretched out, it may not be not genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pixie ear' (sometimes known as 'bat ear'), says Dr Norman Rowe, a plastic surgeon at Rowe Plastic Surgery in New Jersey, is a 'telltale' sign that someone has been under the knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'Pixie ear is certainly not normal and not anatomic, and it's usually a result of as face lift, neck lift, or both.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ear lobe normally has a 'U' shape that stops before hitting the cheek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if someone has had a face or neck lift, and surgeons put too much pressure on the incision site, it can cause the ear lobe to become abnormally stretched.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A face lift, also called a rhytidectomy, involves pulling back a flap of skin on each side of the face to reduce sagging and produce a tightened effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are several types of face lift, but a traditional one involves separating skin from its underlying tissues and tightening the muscles around the face and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 131,000 Americans get a face lift every year. They can cost anywhere between $11,000 to $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neck lift, also called a lower rhytidectomy, is less invasive and is performed about 160,000 times per year. They generally costs between $3,000 and $15,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeons have suggested that Demi Moore has 'pixie ears.' She has denied having plastic surgery in the past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sean McNally, a plastic surgeon at the Oregon Clinic in Portland, told the Daily Mail that scarring near the back of the ear could also indicate a recent face lift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'For face lifts the incisions are typically run around the ear. The ones in front of the ear can heal so well it’s hard to tell, but the ones behind the ear are usually more visible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rowe noted that someone who has had a face lift may have a 'boxier' tragus, the small, pointed cartilage flap located in front of the ear canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It's normally got a curve to it, but when you cut behind the ear, sometimes it ends up being a little boxy. That is telltale.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Hair changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeon Dr Johnny Betteridge has suggested that Kim Kardashian may have had a face lift based on changes to her hairline. He said: 'Given her facial appearance, I think she had a Ponytail Facelift around two or three years ago, where the scars are discreetly put in the hairline by the temple and behind the ear'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tom Brady is pictured during the Super Bowl last month. Generally, there should be about an inch of space between the end of a man's sideburns and the start of his beard. If that space looks like it is closing up, it is usually because of a face lift, since the face gets pulled back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Is your coworker suddenly wearing her hair down for the first time in months? She may have had a face lift, Dr Rowe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see it all the time with my patients if they're one, two or three weeks post op. Their hairstyle automatically changes. They might wear their hair one way for years, then all of a sudden their hair is different,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's to cover up scars. Especially if you've had a face lift, you're not going to pin it back.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rowe said the same goes for a man, as he may let his beard grow out to hide swelling and incision sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, there should be about an inch of space between the end of a man's sideburns and the start of his beard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Christopher Costa, founder of Platinum Plastic Surgery in Las Vegas, said that if that space looks like it is closing up, it is usually because of a face lift, since the face gets pulled back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also noted that if a person's hairline starts to shift, it could be due to a brow lift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also called a forehead lift, a brow lift involves repositioning the forehead to get rid of wrinkles and raise the eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 88,000 brow lifts are performed in the US every year, and they cost about $5,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman may also stop dying her roots if she's had a brow lift, Dr Rowe says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you color your hair, the toxic chemicals can affect the incisions and the wound healing. You won't want someone manipulating the scalp too aggressively because it can cause the incision to open up,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgeon Dr Jonny Betteridge has suggested that Kim Kardashian may have had a face lift based on changes to her hairline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Given her facial appearance, I think she had a Ponytail Facelift around two or three years ago, where the scars are discreetly put in the hairline by the temple and behind the ear' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Maybe it's not just Maybelline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Love Island UK star Alexandra Cane, pictured here, confirmed she had CO2 laser resurfacing done in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone seems to have a skincare routine and nearly three in four US women wear makeup regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if a co-worker's skin looks too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Costa said: 'Yes, skincare works. But glass-smooth skin with no pores, no fine lines and an almost wax-like glow? That is likely a combination of laser resurfacing, chemical peels and Botox.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In laser skin resurfacing, surgeons use a beam to destroy the outer layer of skin and heat the underlying layer. This is said to stimulate the growth of collagen, a protein that improves firmness and texture, leading the skin to become smoother and tighter as it heals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per procedure, skin resurfacing costs between $400 and $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A chemical peel, meanwhile, is another type of 'resurfacing' that uses chemical solutions rather than lasers to remove the top layers of the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Depending on how deep the procedure goes, peels can remove wrinkles, acne, uneven skin tones, dryness, scars and precancerous growths, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Light chemical peels cost around $100 to $300, while deeper peels can run up to $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;'Narrow' or 'bunny' nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anne Hathaway has never confirmed or denied rumors about having a nose job, though plastic surgeon Dr Gary Motykie has told the Daily Mail that he has 'no doubt she had surgery on her nose.' He said: 'You see it go from a slightly more plunging bulbous tip with a wide bridge to having a much more defined contour and thinner bridge... That's the leading sign of having a rhinoplasty'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A radical nose job may be pretty obvious, but sometimes you'll have to look out for more subtle signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as a rhinoplasty, the operation changes the size and shape of the nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgery may involve making the nose smaller by removing some of the cartilage and bone, or making it larger by adding cartilage from the ears and, sometimes, bone from the hips, elbow or skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, a rhinoplasty costs around $7,000, though they can range up to $15,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Costa explained that while a good rhinoplasty should be undetectable, a narrow nose is often a sign of a recent procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'A good rhinoplasty is all about balance, but if the nose tip looks pinched or the nostrils suddenly flare in a way they never used to, it's a sign of overcorrection.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of Botox could also show up on a colleague's nose. Experts point to bunny lines, creases along both sides of the nose that form when someone laughs, smiles or squints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These typically form if too much Botox has been injected into the area, as it can weaken the muscles that hold our eyebrows down into place. Muscles around the nose then have to over-compensate, causing the bunny lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional Botox at the sides of the nose can help get rid of bunny lines, though they do also naturally fade in about three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Costa noted a new 'tiny shadow above the upper lip' could be another indicator of a rhinoplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means the angle of the nose has changed, likely from surgery,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cleveland Clinic estimates 350,000 nose jobs are performed every year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That also makes it a convenient moment to pop our daily vitamin supplements. But it turns out the drink you choose to wash them down with has a lot to do with it how much of the goodness your body actually soaks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry to break it to you, but &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/best-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;your morning brew&lt;/a&gt; may not be ideal. While we rely on caffeine for a jolt of energy, it can also interfere with how well some vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are six vitamin and mineral supplements that you should avoid taking with tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is essential in making hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. It plays a key role in energy production, hormone synthesis, strengthening the immune system, and even neurological development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/"}' href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, women who lose a lot of blood during their monthly period are at higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/12-signs-that-you-could-have-an-iron-deficiency-and-how-to-feel-better" target="_blank"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt; anemia and may need to supplement. The trouble is, “caffeine can inhibit the absorption of iron supplements—the same goes for the iron in your food,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rhian Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, nutritional therapist and founder of Artah. “Studies have shown that coffee and tea intake can also inhibit iron from food sources, so if you’re anemic or pregnant and working to get your levels up, it’s useful to pay particular attention to this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2598894/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that polyphenols, especially tannins, can also play havoc with your iron supplement. These plant compounds found in tea and coffee essentially bind with iron during digestion, reducing the amount that your body absorbs. Switching to decaffeinated tea or coffee sadly isn’t the answer, as the polyphenols still remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of non-heme iron found in plant foods such as nuts, whole grains, and leafy greens, says Rhian. “This is because of their polyphenol content, which can transform non-heme iron into a form that is non-absorbable,” she notes. “There is a lesser effect on heme [animal-based] iron.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823172327.htm" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823172327.htm"}' href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823172327.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; have found that vitamin D influences over 200 genes in our body. It keeps our &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/best-immune-system-booster-foods-to-eat-right-now" target="_blank"&gt;immune systems&lt;/a&gt; healthy, regulates our sex hormones, and is essential for the body to absorb calcium in order to strengthen bones and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also key for regulating sleep. “Low vitamin D levels increase the risk of sleep difficulties, including shorter sleep duration, increased nocturnal awakenings, and delayed sleep onset,” Rhian explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some studies have shown that we can experience a caffeine-induced decrease in vitamin D receptor expression, resulting in lower levels in those who drink more caffeine,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://scholarship.miami.edu/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Caffeine-decreases-vitamin-D-receptor-protein/991031562323102976" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://scholarship.miami.edu/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Caffeine-decreases-vitamin-D-receptor-protein/991031562323102976"}' href="https://scholarship.miami.edu/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Caffeine-decreases-vitamin-D-receptor-protein/991031562323102976" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;joint study&lt;/a&gt; by Creighton University in Nebraska and the University of Miami, Florida, found that caffeine reduced the expression of vitamin D receptors on osteoblasts—the cells in our bodies responsible for producing bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C, B vitamins, magnesium, and potassium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s not much that vitamin C can’t do. It helps the body produce &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-collagen-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, a protein used to make cartilage, ligaments, skin, and blood vessels.

Let the virus rip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Instead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Mr. Kennedy said recently on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;He has repeated the idea in &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;other interviews&lt;/a&gt; on the channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy does not have jurisdiction over farms. But Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, also has voiced support for the notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,” Ms. Rollins told Fox News last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Yet veterinary scientists said letting the virus sweep through poultry flocks unchecked would be inhumane and dangerous, and have enormous economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Now, &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma-allergy-research/allergy-capitals/"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday by the nonprofit Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America shows where allergy sufferers had it the worst last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LKPS73HJXFD4DCZDMX5CZ4TRLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;About a quarter of U.S. adults suffer from seasonal allergies — many experiencing itchy and watery eyes, a scratchy throat and an ever-running nose. Pollen exposure is now lasting longer and intensifying nationwide, data shows, as warmer temperatures take over more of the year. But for some areas, the changes are more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T5X2NNB22FCIBBFQLBHBDCNNEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The report ranks the top 100 largest U.S. cities by how challenging they were for allergy sufferers to live in last year. These “allergy capitals” are based not only on pollen counts, but also on the use of over-the-counter medication and the number of allergy physicians in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RBUZJ2XBSJBTROS43BWFKGQJAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The top cities belonged to the Midwest and Southeast, which are also regions expected to see a lot more pollen as the climate warms. For the third year in a row, Wichita, Kansas, was the most challenging place to live with allergies. New Orleans ranked the second most challenging — jumping up 30 spots from last year — due to a higher weed pollen season probably fueled by moisture from hurricane season and record fall warmth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YYTYRA2YUFDTPHRNP2J5WBVJU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of the least problematic places to live with allergies last year were in the Northeast, a result of low pollen, probably from drought, and above-average access to medical help. Boston, which was ranked the least challenging allergy city, experienced relatively low tree, grass and weed pollen and has a high number of allergy physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZKQPFBKJVRC6DD3G3AQPM255DA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Washington, D.C., which had an average amount of pollen, also ranked as a lower “allergy city” because of a high number of allergists in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERBRBVJHUNASFLNDMEJW4VN55A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pollen was also unusually high in California last year. Many cities, which are typically low in pollen, experienced above-average pollen last year. A likely culprit was the deluge of wet weather there, including atmospheric rivers, that helped grass and weeds grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66PXGNBNDRC25HFAKCMBD7N3JE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Places with the least amount of pollen concentrated around the Upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PRILKS6BMBCBVFFCJXQVWTXIHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If your city is ranked lower on the list, the report “doesn’t mean to dismiss how badly people are feeling in certain regions,” said Kenny Mendez, president of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZAJELAYZBNAAJMY5OZZQLPGQSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If that were a bad season for you, and you’re really suffering … then it might be time for you to go see a doctor&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="VVF74MZJ2FHDZL62KQBNN5BWMM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="VVF74MZJ2FHDZL62KQBNN5BWMM"&gt;Living in the most challenging places&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BJ74D4R245HEFBBJ7HSUECERZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In his nearly 50-year career, immunologist Maurice Strickland has practiced in several states. But he’s never seen a place as bad as Wichita, which was ranked the most challenging city in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PA5NSN7DOFCJ7HNB3GQSHBQKPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“People have quite a lot of allergy here in Wichita, more than any other place I lived or practiced,” said Strickland, who has been running a private practice in the city for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QH2AUY6SYJEXNNZRPBJNLNOIUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People usually have issues with allergies at different times of the year, although seasons begin to merge as it becomes warmer overall on Earth. Tree pollen typically creates problems in the spring, grass pollen overwhelms in the summer and ragweed pollen appears in the fall. When any of these pollens enter our bodies, our immune system mistakenly identifies these substances as intruders and produces antibodies to attack them — inducing runny noses, wheezing, watery eyes and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VXN25T56DNET5DRUWSZJGNDY4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last year, cities in the Midwest and Southeast topped the list of most challenging places to live with allergies. Both are in warmer regions and have big pollen-producing vegetation, and they are worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YRW5YEICZFT3ISLSIMQLM3UZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Across the United States,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pollen seasons begin earlier and last longer&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;than they did decades ago. A &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;study found&lt;/a&gt; that pollen season starts 20 days earlier than 30 years ago. Pollen counts also increased by 21 percent over the same period — but the greatest increases are in the Midwest and Texas, and in tree pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6UCJK2S5HFEBTBYJT2TNFGOYKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wichita has consistently shown high pollen counts for trees and grasses, according to 11 years’ worth of data from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The city has a lot of trees that produce pollen,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;including oak and birch trees. It can also be in the crosswinds for additional pollen from nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KCJRQCOCDNEBNHCQPJ6D4FP5JI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“With the big winds we have and flat Kansas,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pollens come up from warmer climates like the Hill Country of Texas,” Strickland said. “They can show up even before the growing season here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUBBGTR22JDP7EQ4CBNK2GDVZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last year, tree pollen season also began early in Austin — beginning in December and peaking in March. Midwest cities such as Austin and Tulsa usually suffer from “cedar fever” in the winter months from its Ashe juniper pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KXGARTUESJGQPPK2VCMM25LVAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The pollen keeps Strickland busy in Wichita. Strickland’s practice is one of only a few offices — enough to count on perhaps one hand — specializing in allergy treatment in the city, which has about 400,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DMVRMP4QYFFZZFDF66QVCITXFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Doctors who aren’t specialists like Strickland are also seeing more patients with allergies but have limited tests. At the American Family Care Urgent Care, family medicine physician Samrah Mansoor sees a lot more allergy patients during spring. Her 17-year-old son is experiencing allergies for the first time this year and is having trouble sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NQCS4UBXLVASFH7TS2DX37JQIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We are a small town. We’re not a huge town that we have a ton of specialists,” said Mansoor, the medical director of the clinic.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As a result, patients often go to their primary-care physicians or urgent care. She said doctors often suggest over-the-counter medications for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EW2SHQWOYRHBNEDUSLRRPBW2QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Outside of the Midwest, many Southeast cities also usually experience worse-than-average pollen. Some reasons include the types of trees in the region and disturbances to the land, said plant physiologist Lewis Ziska, who was not involved in the report. Construction, for example, disturbs the soil and promotes the growth of weed species and pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QC7FPQMDFJCBFKOXSEGSD2SAZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The same scenario plays out for many of the top 20 challenging cities, according to the report. Nearly all had worse-than-average pollen counts last year, and the report shows they had a low number of specialists or high use of over-the-counter medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="FUHUVW6RVVBM3MEKFIVJRBTDBM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="FUHUVW6RVVBM3MEKFIVJRBTDBM"&gt;Where to go for the least challenging allergies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IPXWL5UV5HUBL4UNGH4HI3VIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Allergies are expected to get worse in coming decades. Warmer temperatures allow trees, grasses and weeds to grow for longer periods of time. The increase in carbon dioxide also acts as extra fuel to allow vegetation to grow even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HJCLVP72VVCTFBGZGNI3Q22OM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So where should you go if you want to avoid a lot of allergy problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BLNY34VHNZGTPP4AJJQ4UZHLTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The southeast and mountain regions consistently had the &lt;a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/4105/2017/gmd-10-4105-2017.pdf"&gt;highest pollen concentrations&lt;/a&gt; in the past , said atmospheric scientist Yingxiao Zhang. But some of the lowest pollen levels were found in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, California and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MF1G06BD7H4TFFR10G9NC8VX70" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Compared with the other regions of the United States, cities in the Northeast ranked relatively well with allergies last year, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SIICEGTGZVCKVMC77R7UJO6RM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One factor for the lower pollen may be its relatively shorter season. In the Northeast, maple, birch, oak and cedar trees are the prominent pollen producers, but they last for a short time — typically from April to the beginning of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="67OCQ7BKCFHYHL25NDCTHMYOJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the shorter season can be more intense in the Northeast than other places, said Zhang, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. As temperatures and carbon dioxide increase, the growth of these allergenic trees begins to overlap more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2BVMLF3P2JEQNMT5TKNYJ7N7DU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weed pollen season also picks up in the Northeast at the end of the summer into the fall. Last year, though, a regional drought probably stifled plant growth and pollen. The region also has a high number of allergists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SCHUK7QI5JDDJJHSFN22P3HSWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall though, scientists say, cities&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are some of the worst places to live if you have allergies. For one, air pollution — especially small particulate matter — can further stimulate the immune system and create more symptoms when inhaled at the same time as pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQVNVJVG4VGZZNT3XMOJOESTIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Secondly, the concrete jungles absorb more sunlight and increase the temperatures of cities by a few degrees, which allow plants to grow bigger, faster and longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PBAOETMK6VBWFA2C225BSIWWHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(03)00959-X/fulltext"&gt;one experiment&lt;/a&gt;, Ziska and his team planted ragweed in urban Baltimore, where temperatures and carbon dioxide was greater, and outside the city. They found the urban ragweed grew quicker, flowered earlier and produced more pollen than the ragweed outside of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GU6Y3LCL5JBMBFYVJQ2E65NMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We have cities that are getting warmer … which in turn obviously can affect pollen,” said Ziska, an&lt;b&gt;

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12105"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12106"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12107"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNT3oyUTlQWnJEdnQ2bEl1OXVyUF9kRlBEVnlGdk1jZzR5VU5hd1ltSjl0OEF5VkZCMXZoSWZ4RTRlUWNpVndtaW1DU0dwVzgxbElqNkQ2QnpBYlZtcUdkQ251OE9xY2paci1Jc0k0alJUWGJIY25zVTh6ZDhMZUFNWHhMRDJ2OVcyZmhzQms3WGN1NFJzOFRDVFJjY080V1NBQ2VZUVhn</guid></item><item><title>WTF 2.0: Your Local Epidemiologist with Katelyn Jetelina - The Bulwark</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE01SUVKQ2pqdVBIM05UVFlUZTFiWHdITlVuQlY1Vk5PaGFCNVJjdzVyY3l1eTZlRDd2RTlaV1l1ZWdUSWRFSnI0RUUwMUpwTHhzRVJ1cjNHQXdEYnY2NnBBVHZFc1VLSFZEcG9zOFpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;JVL talks with Your Local Epidemiologist with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt; about the measles outbreak, public health and misinformation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wtf-20-your-local-epidemiologist/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wtf-20-your-local-epidemiologist/comments" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/t/wtf-20" rel&gt;WTF 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a pop-up show on Substack during the first 100 days of second Trump administration.

&lt;p&gt;Planning a sunny getaway? You might want to pack a mosquito net. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/9/E244#msdynmkt_trackingcontext=fed021b2-0f52-49ac-9c7a-72decef20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are warning&lt;/a&gt; about an emerging threat making waves in popular vacation destinations, as cases of the Oropouche virus have been reported in US and Canadian travelers returning from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much about the tropical disease remains unknown, the recent spate of infections has raised questions about whether it could become the next Zika virus. Here’s everything you need to know about this potential travel headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mosquitoes are believed to play a role in Oropouche virus transmission.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wirakorn – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus is primarily spread through the bites of small flies called midges, as well as certain species of mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s commonly referred to as “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/what-is-sloth-fever-oropouche-virus/"&gt;sloth fever&lt;/a&gt;” because the virus was first identified in the slow-moving mammal, which researchers believe played a key role in its spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1955, there have been an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 500,000 cases of Oropouche virus&lt;/a&gt;, mostly around the Amazon Basin. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;starting in late 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has started popping up in new areas of South America and the Caribbean where it hadn’t been seen before, raising concerns about its expanding reach.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;As of March 11, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC has identified&lt;/a&gt; 109 cases of sloth fever in US travelers from seven states, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/2024-09-12_rare_virus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case in New York&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the illnesses have been reported in Florida, with 103 cases so far in 2024 and the first three months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symptoms to watch for&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a mosquito or midge carrying the Oropouche virus, symptoms can appear anywhere from three to 10 days later, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms include a sudden fever and severe headache, often resembling those of other tropical illnesses like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/25/dengue-fever-cases-could-reach-near-record-highs-this-year-what-to-know-about-the-tropical-infectious-disease/#!"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/01/28/first-person-account-of-being-stricken-with-the-zika-virus/"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt; or malaria. Additional symptoms can include chills, muscle aches, joint pain, light sensitivity, dizziness, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many of the symptoms of sloth fever are similar to those of other tropical diseases, such as the Zika virus. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dragana Gordic – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most cases, symptoms last less than a week, with most people fully recovering within a month. However, the CDC notes that some individuals may experience a recurrence of symptoms, either a few days or even weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, the Oropouche virus can cause more severe conditions, such as excessive bleeding, brain swelling, or &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/28/health/guillain-barre-patient-running-nyc-marathon-a-decade-after-diagnosis/"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to muscle weakness, numbness and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While fatalities are uncommon, there have been a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;few instances where the virus has proven fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pregnancy risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus doesn’t just pose a threat to adults and children — it can also be transmitted from a pregnant person to their unborn fetus, with potentially devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Multiple reports of fetal loss among women with Oropouche virus disease during early and late pregnancy have been reported. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infection during pregnancy has been linked to stillbirths, miscarriages, and other serious risks to the fetus, such as low birth weight, skull collapse, club foot, and microcephaly, a condition where brain development is significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given these risks, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/outbreaks/2024/index.html#:~:text=Oropouche%20virus%20is%20spread%20to,Travel%20Health%20Notice%20for%20Oropouche." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is advising&lt;/a&gt; pregnant women to reconsider any nonessential travel to areas where &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/oropouche-in-the-americas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oropouche outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have recently been reported.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How is sloth fever treated? &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no vaccine to prevent or specific medication to treat Oropouche virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To manage symptoms, the CDC recommends getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers. But don’t reach for aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as they can increase the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those with more severe symptoms, additional medical care or even hospitalization may be required to ensure proper treatment and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect yourself from the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To steer clear of the Oropouche virus, your best bet is to minimize exposure to mosquito and midge bites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; wearing loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants when traveling to regions where the virus is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Loose fitting, long-sleeve shirts can help prevent mosquito bites.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;aamulya – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure your accommodations are bug-proof by using window and door screens, or set up a fan outdoors to keep the pests at bay. And of course, don’t forget to bring along insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; also found traces of Oropouche virus in the semen of an infected individual for the first time. While no sexual transmission cases have been reported, the CDC suggests that travelers who are worried about contracting or passing the virus through sex to consider using condoms or abstaining from sex during travel and for six weeks after returning home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Could sloth fever start to spread in the US?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Oropouche cases have been reported in American travelers, the risk of widespread transmission in the continental US remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC notes that the US has a different climate and distinct species of mosquitoes and midges compared to those in regions where the virus is common. Additionally, factors like air conditioning make it less likely for the virus to take root. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the agency does warn that infections could still pop up in certain areas. &lt;/p&gt;

Ragweed season may last 6 to 10 weeks until the first frost.

She pushed for more, like a CT scan. Because &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/raised-in-canada-live-in-us-life-better-in-us-2024-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Canada's healthcare system&lt;/a&gt; is public, wait times were longer. The CT scan she was scheduled for was a year out, in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she tried to mitigate her extreme &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;abdominal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; by eating smaller snacks. Still, she was frequently constipated, had pencil-thin stools, and felt a nagging pain in her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I ate, I was in excruciating pain, pretty much yelling for help," Desroches, now 27, told Business Insider. "I knew with my symptoms I wasn't going to make it" to the scan, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches was eventually admitted for an emergency &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; in early 2024, but the procedure couldn't be finished — the tumor in her colon was too big. The GI specialist "couldn't get the camera through," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with stage 4 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, given a three-year life expectancy.

"That's the most frustrating part to me, knowing that I shouldn't have to be here fighting stage 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="60dcc152-fb2b-4454-94b2-7211b8bd4df5" data-toc-id="60dcc152-fb2b-4454-94b2-7211b8bd4df5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From dismissal to emergency surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;Desroches started with an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;MRI in April 2024, which she managed to book thanks to the help of a family friend. When she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;left the room, her family friend and a GI surgeon were waiting for her. "They were like, 'I don't want to freak you out, but we need to admit you, you have a blockage,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;colonoscopy the next morning confirmed it was a tumor, and she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was immediately admitted to a six-hour surgery, which removed part of her large intestine where the tumor was located, her right ovary, 13 lymph nodes, and part of the membrane lining her liver. The surgeon couldn't remove the large tumors on the liver itself without causing liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she woke up in the morning with her husband by her side, the surgeon broke the news: she had stage 4 cancer. If they wanted children, the doctor recommended starting &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/39-year-old-woman-spent-6000-on-egg-retrieval-2022-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;egg retrieval&lt;/a&gt; from her left ovary right away, because the cancer was likely to spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember just almost disassociating," Desroches said. Once the doctors left, she and her husband broke down. "We just had a good cry together and just bawled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2e60a74b-2873-4b49-8249-352a2b73f7da" data-toc-id="2e60a74b-2873-4b49-8249-352a2b73f7da"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for care options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;Chemo became complicated. On round 13 of receiving oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug, Desroches went into&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/anaphylaxis" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt;, and had to stop taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably the scariest feeling I've ever felt, knowing that my body is literally shutting down on me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the results of her treatment make her nervous: her CT scan in January was the first one in which her tumors didn't shrink. She doesn't know what to anticipate for her next one, in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Desroches is searching for other options. The surgery she needs, a hepatic arterial infusion pump to deliver chemotherapy drugs directly into her liver, is only available as a clinical trial in Canada — one she doesn't qualify for because she has cancer outside her liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure is more routine in the US, but her oncologist said the treatment could cost $500,000 or more when considering testing, a US hospital stay, and treating any complications — something that isn't financially feasible for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's now looking into options in Europe and started a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/shannins-cancer-fight" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; for her cancer treatments. "It's very overwhelming, but when you're in fight-or-flight mode for your life, it doesn't matter," she said. "You just do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="929fd71e-d669-4184-979b-f757825e52ad" data-toc-id="929fd71e-d669-4184-979b-f757825e52ad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;Since starting treatment in 2024, Desroches and her family are trying to stay optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Desroches married her husband, Cody Desroches, at a beachside wedding in Jamaica. "I would do anything to go&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;back to that day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're planning to have kids, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after her surgery, Desroches met with a fertility doctor to begin her egg-freezing process immediately. "This was the most pain I've ever been in," she said. She was nauseous from the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/egg-freezing-fertility-clinics-targeting-gen-z-women-high-cost-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;hormone injections&lt;/a&gt;, dry-heaving so hard that she felt her surgical staples would rip open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her surgeries, she said she'll never be able to carry her own child, but hopes she and her husband can use a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/surrogate-paid-22500-and-30000-twice-said-experience-was-empowering-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;surrogate&lt;/a&gt; one day.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;It's hard to picture her future, she said. "It's just natural when you're at this age — you're always thinking about what's next," whether it's planning a trip, renovating her house, or having kids. At the same time, she never knows if she can commit to a family gathering or if she'll feel too sick to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She savors every moment with her loved ones, a contrast to her "busybody" life as a nurse prior to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I try not to focus on that three-year mark because that's just a statistic," she said. "That's not me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding was made through the society’s &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-the-society/who-we-are/research-we-fund/fast-forward-commercial"&gt;Fast Forward program&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical development for new therapies and diagnostic tools that address disease progression and progressive forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://myrotx.com/"&gt;Myrobalan&lt;/a&gt;‘s experimental therapy MRO-002 is a GPR17 antagonist, or inhibitor, that’s designed to promote myelin repair in people with MS and other demyelinating conditions. With the grant, the company will conduct additional preclinical experiments to determine if it may have therapeutic benefits in progressive MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to receive the Fast Forward grant from the National MS Society and appreciate their confidence in our drug development approach,” Jing Wang, PhD, CEO and co-founder of Myrobalan, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312951560/en/Myrobalan-Therapeutics-Awarded-a-Grant-from-the-National-Multiple-Sclerosis-Society-to-Advance-Development-of-MRO-002-in-Multiple-Sclerosis"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe that MRO-002 has the potential to promote myelin repair in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and conditions involving recovery from [central nervous system] injury.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Finding ways to aid myelin repair&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt;, a fatty coating around nerve cells. Like an insulator on electrical wires, myelin protects nerve fibers and ensures the efficient transmission of nerve signals. When it’s lost, patients experience a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; related to disrupted nerve signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, specialized cells in the brain and spinal cord. While existing oligodendrocytes have some ability to repair damaged myelin or restore lost myelin, the remyelination process isn’t very efficient in MS due to ongoing inflammation. There’s also insufficient maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into fully functional oligodendrocytes that are able to produce myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in MS treatment is the repair of damaged myelin. While available &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; help reduce relapses and slow disease progression, their ability to repair myelin and reverse disability is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding therapies that can improve remyelination has been a longstanding goal in MS research. One promising approach involves targeting GPR17, a receptor in OPCs that prevents the cells from maturing into fully functional oligodendrocytes, thereby limiting myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRO-002 is a highly selective GPR17 antagonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier, the protective membrane that restricts the passage of most substances from the bloodstream into the brain. This ability lets it reach the brain and remove this brake from OPCs, causing them to mature and boosting the production of new myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preclinical studies on human-derived oligodendrocytes and animal models of demyelination &lt;a href="https://myrotx.com/news/myrobalan-to-present-gpr17-antagonist-preclinical-data-at-ectrims-2024/"&gt;have shown encouraging results&lt;/a&gt;. MRO-002 significantly boosted the maturation of oligodendrocytes in both models, resulting in enhanced remyelination in the brains of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from the National MS Society, the company hopes to conduct additional studies to support MRO-002’s development toward clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a therapy that promotes myelin repair would have tremendous implications for people living with MS,” said Walter Kostich, PhD, associate vice president of translational research at the National MS Society. “We are happy to support Myrobalan Therapeutics’ preclinical testing of MRO-002 and look forward to learning whether it has translational potential for people with MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A United Nations food agency warned that the continued spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus is an unprecedented food security risk that requires a coordinated global response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a briefing held on Monday, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations cited the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry around the world and the increasing spillover into mammals as key concerns stemming from the spread of the H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The agency noted a major shift in bird flu’s geographic spread in the past four years, with at least 300 newly affected wild bird species since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calling the spread unprecedented, FAO Deputy Director-General Godfrey Magwenzi said the disease was “leading to serious impacts on food security and food supply in countries, including loss of valuable nutrition, rural jobs and income, shocks to local economies, and of course increasing costs to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol called for a coordinated global response, saying, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. By working together, we can reduce the impact of avian influenza and protect both animal and human health – locally and globally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency called on countries to enhance surveillance and reporting of bird flu; improve lab capacity; develop and implement preparedness plans; consider vaccinations in the response; and to promote risk management through biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. has 70 cases of bird flu, including 41 cattle herds as well as 24 poultry farms and culling operations. As a zoological disease, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission so far and the risk to the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;released a plan&lt;/a&gt; to invest $1 billion to combat the bird flu and reduce egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, a strain of highly pathogenic bird flu that hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since 2017 was &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5199450-mississippi-reports-first-outbreak-of-highly-pathogenic-bird-flu-strain-in-us-since-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported in a commercial flock&lt;/a&gt;. This occurrence is believed to be unrelated to the current H5N1 spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease has been credited with causing egg prices to spike, and restaurants have begun implementing surcharges for egg dishes. The Justice Department, however, is also &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-investigating-major-egg-producers-amid-soaring-prices/story?id=119589959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reportedly investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether major egg producers are colluding to increase prices while using the bird flu situation as a cover.&lt;/p&gt;

Stop immediately if you experience pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem hard to believe, but snacking several times a day can boost your health and fitness — exercise snacking, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise snacks” are short bursts of activity — 30 seconds to five or 10 minutes max — that encompass almost any type of movement. Think climbing stairs, walking, doing squats or dancing. The term is thought to have been first used in 2007 by cardiologist Dr. Howard Hartley, who was then associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Today, numerous studies prove the value of these mini workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performing 15- to 30-second exercise snacks three times daily was shown to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness levels and exercise performance in inactive adults, according to a small January 2022 study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2022/01000/exercise_snacks__a_novel_strategy_to_improve.5.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. The “snacks” in the study were stair-climbing and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who reported they didn’t work out saw a 17% to 18% reduction in cancer incidence after they began doing just 3.4 to 3.6 minutes of vigorous physical activity daily, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10375384/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:July 2023 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;July 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of 22,398 people found. Their daily physical activity was done in bursts lasting less than one or two minutes. Hitting 4.5 minutes of vigorous, intermittent physical activity each day was associated with a 31% to 32% reduction in cancer incidence, according to the study published in JAMA Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of movement extend to brain health, too. Doing even a small amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day, or adding a small amount to your current exercise regimen, reduces your risk of dementia, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:March study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;March study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMDA: The Journal of the Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medical Association. Those who hadn’t been doing any moderate to vigorous exercise received the largest benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing anything is better than doing nothing,” said Michael Betts, a personal trainer and director at TrainFitness who’s based in London. “As long as you’re moving some of the time, putting a little stress on your body, it will adapt and improve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Climbing the stairs as you go about your day can be one way to work in an exercise snack. - South_agency/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes can result in big rewards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks are a favorite tool used by Dr. Supatra Tovar, owner of Dr. Supatra Tovar &amp;amp; Associates, a holistic health clinical psychology practice in Pasadena, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big proponent of behavior change that starts tiny,” Tovar said. “So I like to create behaviors with my clients that are easy, accessible and doable every to most every day of the week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to making tiny, new changes stick is to tie them to a behavior you do every day at the same time, Tovar said. For example, if you immediately brush your teeth upon waking up, start doing a few jumping jacks or lunges as soon as you set down your toothbrush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you incorporate exercise snacks as a habit, they start to become ingrained, and you’ll begin to see their lifelong benefits,” Tovar said. “Anyone I’ve given these to have reported back that they had no idea how much of a positive difference they would make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the easiest exercise snacks, according to Tovar and Betts. It can entail a stroll around your neighborhood or just a lap around your living room. Once you get in the habit of walking a little each day, you can progress to doing intervals, increasing your pace for 20 seconds, slowing down for 10 and then repeating several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It pushes your body a little more each time,” Betts said, “after which your body adapts and improves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t rely just on walking. Wall push-ups will build strength in your arms, for example, while squats are great for beefing up your leg strength. If you want to be able to climb stairs without getting out of breath, start walking up and down stairs a little more quickly than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always an exercise snack that can help improve each part of your body in some way,” Betts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also make any exercise snack more difficult if it becomes too easy. A wall push-up can progress to one performed on the floor, while a chair squat can become an air squat. An easy stroll can turn into a light jog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise snacks are a NEAT hack&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks don’t have to be a specific type of activity, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cleaning your house is exercise,” said Tovar, who is a fan of NEAT movements. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468415/#:~:text=Non%2Dexercise%20activity%20thermogenesis%20(NEAT)%20is%20the%20energy%20expended,undertaking%20agricultural%20tasks%20and%20fidgeting." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NEAT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, or nonexercise activity thermogenesis, refers to the energy expended from all physical activities that aren’t structured exercise. Doing chores, playing with your kids and even fidgeting are all forms of NEAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tovar points to people living in “blue zones,” which are areas around the globe where people routinely live long and healthy lives, such as Okinawa, Japan, and the Italian island of Sardinia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re moving all of the time, doing NEAT exercise all day long,” she said, whether that’s walking to the store, squatting to garden, carrying groceries or doing chores. “NEAT exercise can burn up to 2,000 extra calories per day if you’re constantly moving throughout the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that motion is welcomed by the body and not a detriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body is kind of lazy,” Betts said. “It doesn’t like to do much and will slowly deteriorate over time without use. Doing these little exercise snacks reminds your body that it does need to work to maintain and improve its overall function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thethousandmiler.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melanie Radzicki McManus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melanie Radzicki McManus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:14:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE45Q0dReWpLRHgxV3ZVMXZRRUpFM3FNS0lvWWR1VGFZTXlpUEhZdURsVDBzM0xrM25iMlZRZW1ITFNEcUk2RGVSaWpNWWlqbzFJMVNrMDVYdEMxQlc2U3JaS1oybjFBU2JDdnhuaWtvRDV5d1k</guid></item><item><title>7 Important Ways To Look After Your Teeth - Rediff.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOcmZ4Rkw1TGh2NDd3SE9oTkJUSmlLbUJTWjdiTjdnc2tCQWc1bHJoVHpINTdWUGNLZ0ZnQXdzQkZhSXZWZ3NFM0l5WFRwTnNJTnpUb190ZW5SazB5STc0ZXJ5WlU0c1YwN2hOZ2RvQlcyc0pwVDMxTm44R3JiTTBocDRtdXhiUVhqcjNkWkRwcm81Vno4OXZQVW5tMl80LTFvU1RHYlhla9IBpwFBVV95cUxOcmZ4Rkw1TGh2NDd3SE9oTkJUSmlLbUJTWjdiTjdnc2tCQWc1bHJoVHpINTdWUGNLZ0ZnQXdzQkZhSXZWZ3NFM0l5WFRwTnNJTnpUb190ZW5SazB5STc0ZXJ5WlU0c1YwN2hOZ2RvQlcyc0pwVDMxTm44R3JiTTBocDRtdXhiUVhqcjNkWkRwcm81Vno4OXZQVW5tMl80LTFvU1RHYlhlaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="contents cover" animate-in="fly-in-bottom" animate-in-duration="1s"&gt;

But during the pregnancy she developed gestational diabetes, so her doctor decided she and her baby would benefit from specialized nutrition counseling and access to food that's good specifically to counter diabetes. The doctor sent her with a prescription to the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald "Oz" Hutton, 60, of Salt Lake City, has battled hypertension, arthritis and chronic pain. What you eat makes a difference there, too, so the U.S. Marine Corps veteran opted into nutritional education and access to high quality produce courtesy of a program that's a partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Veterans Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two programs — and scores of others — are part of the "Food Is Medicine" movement, the belief that what people eat helps determine their health on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, grabs food for a patient at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about the drivers of health, dietary risk factors are shown to be the most important modifiable risk factor for chronic disease and death. Yet in health care, we don't really talk about that much," said Dr. Amy Locke, whose many titles include chief wellness officer at University of Utah Health, professor and co-director of the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative at the Osher Center for Integrative Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locke said modifiable health risk factors are about 20% clinical, 30% behaviors like getting enough sleep or eating well, roughly 10% physical environment and 40% socioeconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have good health care and you have good socioeconomic status, it's easier to eat a healthy diet," she told Deseret News. "What we want to do is use the health care space to leverage those other buckets as much as possible, so we are doing a bunch of 'Food Is Medicine'-related things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government, health care providers, nonprofits, academics and others are embracing the concept that you can be healthier or sicker depending on what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, gives two bags of food to Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health firmly tied together food and health in its call to end hunger and reduce chronic disease by 2030, as the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/food-medicine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt; reports. The office said 60% of U.S. adults have some diet-related chronic disease that the right food — and avoiding the wrong ones — can impact. At the same time, there are 18 million people whose households experience food insecurity. The result is an estimated $4 trillion in health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deseret News looked at two of the dozens of examples of "Food Is Medicine" programs. How programs operate and who they target varies. But many of them — including the University of Utah Food Pharmacy and the pilot project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation involving Salt Lake area veterans who receive services at the VA — share certain traits: The beneficiaries like Hutton and Rivera have medical conditions that food impacts. Participants are considered food insecure and meet income qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programs also both have strong education components to help those benefiting understand why food matters, how to make good food choices and even how easy it is to make good meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also both provide actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Helping veterans get healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Veterans Health Administration hosted a bipartisan Congressional event last week to tout its partnership with the foundation, which just made a $100 million commitment to Food Is Medicine programs, building on its prescription pilot projects in Utah and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects are being launched in Maryland and New York, with partners including the VA, Instacart, Syracuse University, University of Utah, 4P Foods, as well as in North Carolina, Duke University and Reinvestment Partners. The programs have different designs to meet needs in the areas they serve. But the classes, resources and prescriptions are tailored specifically to patients and their chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hutton is one of 275 veterans in the Utah pilot; the programs combined hope to help 2,000 veterans, while gathering research and looking for ways to tackle diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure among U.S. veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with food education, veterans in the program are given gift cards worth $100 a month that can be used to buy fruits and vegetables at participating stores. The program lasts 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired four-star U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, foundation board chair, said access to healthy food improves mental and physical health while lowering the cost of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, helps a patient choose groceries at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health has reported that three-quarters of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were overweight or obese when they first went to a VA clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah Cohen-Cline, director of the Rockefeller Foundation initiative, said the program uses Food Is Medicine initiatives like produce prescriptions, meals tailored to medical needs and groceries that can be prescribed by a clinician as part of medical treatment, "with the big-picture goal of seeing these interventions formally integrated into health care as a covered medical benefit." These pilot projects are testing programs and measuring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation would love to expand it to all eligible veterans, including 116,000 in Utah, but Cohen-Cline said philanthropies alone can't meet the need; that requires funding from other sources, including health care systems and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it saves money and improves quality of life, making it a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, and Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, help a patient choose food from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday.

          &lt;p&gt;Well, someone undertook to answer one of my questions.  And the answer is disturbing. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/aging-might-not-be-enough-eliminate-h5n1-viruses-raw-milk-cheese" target="_blank"&gt;Aging may not eliminate H5N1 virus in raw-milk cheese.&lt;/a&gt; While the FDA has been sampling commercially available raw-milk cheese and has not found any viable virus, Cornell University undertook to make and age cheese with milk deliberately spiked with the virus at different pH levels.  Only the most acidic environment deactivated the virus, the other cheeses still had infectious virions at 60 days aging.  They also note that the virus can persist under refrigeration for 56 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More confirmations in US dairy cows, mammals, and poultry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In outbreak developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed two more H5N1 in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;, both from Idaho, raising the national total to 985. Idaho has now reported three detections over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agri.idaho.gov/animals/animal-disease/hpai-in-cattle/" target="_blank"&gt;Idaho State Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;said three facilities are currently quarantined, all from Gooding County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, APHIS reported nine more detections in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;, including domestic cats from New Jersey, Idaho, and Kansas. Officials also confirmed H5N1 in a harbor seal from Washington and mice from Missouri’s Newton County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In poultry developments, APHIS confirmed more detections in backyard poultry from five states, including Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Colorado, and Indiana, along with detections in two more live poultry markets in New York, one in Queens and the other in Kings County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A study of an affected dairy herd&lt;/u&gt; estimated the costs of infection at $950 per clinically affected cow.  But they also found some asymptomatic cases, and even in dry cows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h5n1-dairy-cow-study-finds-sustained-milk-production-drop-extensive" target="_blank"&gt;Milk production loss lasted at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And only 56% of Americans know that drinking raw milk is dangerous. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/u-penn-survey-shows-only-56-americans-understand-drinking-raw-milk-risky" target="_blank"&gt;Deep sigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The world is being urged &lt;/u&gt;to step up efforts against bird flu.  And tests in mice and human cells show that the bovine strain now current in the US is more pathogenic than an earlier bird strain isolated in Mongolia 20 years ago. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/fao-urges-nations-ramp-actions-blunt-impact-h5n1-avian-flu" target="_blank"&gt;Fair warning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Mississippi broiler farm&lt;/u&gt; has had an outbreak of a different subtype of highly pathogenic avian flu, H7N9, which is North American in origin, and has not been detected in US poultry since 2017. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h7n9-avian-flu-strikes-mississippi-broiler-farm" target="_blank"&gt;Birds were euthanized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Measles&lt;/u&gt;: it's not just us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/vermont-reports-measles-case-europe-warns-highest-case-count-25-years" target="_blank"&gt;Europe is having its worst measles year in decades.&lt;/a&gt; and the numbers are oddly at variance with those from a similar source I cited a few days ago.  (??)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a Mennonite community in Mexico now has measles &lt;a href="https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8722818" target="_blank"&gt;Thought to have been brought from relatives in Texas.&lt;/a&gt;. Don't give me that "immigrants bring diseases into the US" crap.  Children in Mexico's public schools get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A study has found &lt;/u&gt;that a commercially available probiotic reduced the duration of fever in children &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/trial-links-probiotics-fever-reduction-kids-respiratory-infections" target="_blank"&gt;with respiratory infections.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia reported &lt;/u&gt;four MERS infections in the last six months, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/trial-links-probiotics-fever-reduction-kids-respiratory-infections" target="_blank"&gt;Two of them fatal&lt;/a&gt;.  MERS is a zoonotic coronavirus which has rarely managed the human-to-human route.  It is endemic in camels and occasionally passes from a camel to a human. There were no secondary infections in the contacts of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The FDA is investigating&lt;/u&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/03/fda-detects-new-listeria-outbreak-investigations-of-other-outbreaks-continue/" target="_blank"&gt;Listeria outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.  The source has not been identified. A Salmonella outbreak has been declared over with no specific source identified.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study suggested that &lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/muscle-strength"&gt;muscle-strengthening&lt;/a&gt; exercises (think weightlifting, resistance bands and bodyweight movements) could be the most effective way for &lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/senior"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; to improve sleep quality. &lt;strong&gt;[Also read: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/do-you-nap-often-neuroscientist-explains-why-it-is-your-brains-anti-ageing-superpower-shares-tips-to-do-it-right-101742196366838.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you nap often?

Poor sleep is not just frustrating—it is linked to serious health risks, including cognitive decline, heart disease and even an increased risk of workplace errors and absenteeism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/06/550x309/strength_training_1741252986927_1741252987309.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="The study observed the significant role of strength training in helping older adults beat insomnia.

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news? Exercise can help and this study shed light on which type works best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed clinical trials published up to October 2022, comparing different forms of physical exercise with routine activities, standard care, or sleep education. All participants had been formally diagnosed with insomnia and their sleep quality was measured using the Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (GPSQI).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study reviewed data from 24 clinical trials involving 2,045 adults aged 60 and older, with an average age of 70. Most of these trials took place in Asia (56%), followed by North America (16%), South America (16%), and Europe (12%). One in five were conducted in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which exercises were studied?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed different types of exercise, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerobic exercise – Activities like cycling, brisk walking, swimming, and dancing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance training – Weightlifting, push-ups, squats and planks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance exercises – Movements like heel-to-toe walking and step-ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility exercises – Yoga, Pilates, and stretching routines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combination exercise – A mix of strength, aerobic, balance and flexibility workouts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average exercise session lasted around 50 minutes, with participants working out two to three times per week for about 14 weeks. However, due to limited data, the meta-analysis focused primarily on aerobic and combination exercises, with the impact of resistance training extrapolated through network analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How much did sleep improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength training improved sleep the most, boosting GPSQI scores by 5.75 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerobic exercise improved scores by 3.76 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combination exercise improved scores by 2.54 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep education helped but was less effective than strength training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sleep education did show benefits, the study noted inconsistencies in how it was defined across trials, making it difficult to assess its full impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why strength training works best&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, strength training may enhance sleep by reducing stress, improving metabolism and promoting the release of sleep-regulating hormones. Unlike high-intensity aerobic workouts, resistance training does not overstimulate the nervous system, making it easier for older adults to wind down before bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The takeaway: Exercise your way to better sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all forms of exercise are beneficial, resistance training appears to have the greatest impact on sleep quality for older adults. If you are looking for a natural way to improve your sleep, consider adding strength training to your routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/06/original/shutterstock_1555847276_1741253064032.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)" title="Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it is lifting weights, doing bodyweight exercises or using resistance bands, a little strength work could lead to more restful nights and better overall health.

What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“People tend to think of allergies as a childhood thing” and not something they can get later in life, said Dr. Tolly Epstein, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine who researches allergies and immunology. But “it’s very common to develop new allergies,” especially in your 20s, 30s and 40s, she said. And the symptoms aren’t always obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Most people with seasonal allergies will have sneezing, itchy eyes or nasal congestion. But those can also be accompanied by fatigue, a headache or sinus pressure — which, if you’ve never faced allergies before, you might mistake as cold symptoms, Dr. Epstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’ve recently developed a pollen allergy, you might also experience itching in your mouth after eating certain raw fruits and vegetables, said Dr. Andrew Rorie, an assistant professor in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. That’s because the immune system sometimes confuses proteins in the plants for pollen proteins, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-25133f37"&gt;What causes seasonal allergies to develop?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Seasonal allergies are reactions to environmental elements like pollen or mold spores that tend to swirl around in the air during certain times — such as in the spring, when plants pollinate. When you’re allergic to something like pollen, your immune system perceives it as a threat and triggers a chain reaction at the point of exposure. Antibodies in the nose or lungs stimulate the release of chemicals like histamine, which can lead to the sneezing, runny nose or congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists aren’t exactly sure why you can develop new allergies or symptoms without ever having had them before, but there are several potential causes. For one, climate change is causing allergy season to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/well/live/spring-allergy-symptoms.html" title=""&gt;start earlier and last longer&lt;/a&gt;, so it makes people more prone to developing symptoms, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

battles another, separate outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infant was unvaccinated, officials said, and was hospitalized for the disease before being discharged to recover at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case is not connected to the major outbreak in West Texas, where 294 people have been sickened across three states — marking &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14500321/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-doctors-reveal-infected-people-unvaccinated.html"&gt;more cases than recorded&lt;/a&gt; across the entire US in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, an unvaccinated school-girl also died from measles in the outbreak, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14487651/texas-father-daughter-measles-death.html"&gt;first US death from the disease in a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new infection is also not connected to the two cases in unvaccinated adults recorded in Houston in January, who were the city's first since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say they are now tracing anyone who was in close contact with the patient and asking them to isolate. It was not immediately clear whether they traveled through the main airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient was not reported to be a US resident, and no further information was given — including on when they arrived or where they traveled from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesman from the Houston Department of Health told DailyMail.com that no further details on the case were being released in order to protect the patient's privacy.

The above picture is a stock image of a child suffering from measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447249/us-states-red-alert-measles-outbreak-kills-infects.html"&gt;most infectious diseases known to man&lt;/a&gt;, able to infect nine out of ten unvaccinated people that are exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Persse, chief medical officer for Houston, urged people to get vaccinated against measles to slash their risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from measles is through vaccination,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is safe, highly effective, and remains the best defense against this potentially severe disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Although measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, international travel continues to present a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Staying up to date on vaccinations helps protect both individuals and the broader community.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 92 percent of kindergarteners across Texas were vaccinated against measles in 2023 to 2024, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is below the 95 percent level experts say is needed to prevent an outbreak, and below the levels recorded in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Houston area, three of its private schools are among those with the lowest vaccination rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Leadership Academy of Magnolia, north of the city, had a measles vaccination rate of 36 percent in 2023 to 2024, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Academy Cy-Fair, in northwest Houston, had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of the skyline in Houston, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Acton Leadership Academy of Creekside, in Spring, also had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two cases recorded in the city in January were in two unvaccinated adults living in the same household who had recently returned to the city from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their cases also were not linked to the major outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man, and can infect nine in every ten people exposed to it who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It spreads via respiratory droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes that hang in the air and remain infectious for up to two hours after a patient has passed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms erupt seven to 14 days after infection, and begin as a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also suffer from a red, blotchy rash that starts on the face and then extends behind the ears and down the trunk to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Serious complications can occur in young children or those with a weakened immune system, who may suffer from pneumonia, brain swelling and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of one to two children in every thousand who are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to prevent the infection is to be vaccinated, with the first dose given around six months and the second at the ages four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for the disease includes providing medications to help relieve symptoms and bed rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update to provide additional information to healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public about the ongoing risk of dengue virus (DENV) infections and updates to testing recommendations in the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html"&gt;Dengue activity remains high in some parts of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and globally, with many countries reporting higher-than-usual number of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/dengue-global"&gt;dengue cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 and 2025. Healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public are urged to continue to take steps to prevent, detect, diagnose, and respond to dengue as described in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN Health Advisory (CDCHAN-00511)&lt;/a&gt; on dengue in the United States. Updates include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengue virus transmission remains high in the Americas region, including in the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Spring and summer travel coincide with the peak season for dengue in many countries, increasing the risk of both travel-associated and locally acquired cases in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;CDC DENV-1-4 real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay&lt;/a&gt; when dengue is the most likely diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New resources are available for public health professionals including a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/php/resources/medical_records_review.html"&gt;job aid&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing medical records and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/08/response_to_dengue.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;guidance&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for investigating and responding to dengue cases in non-endemic areas of the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/about/index.html"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is caused by four distinct but closely related dengue viruses or serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). Infection with one DENV usually induces lifelong immunity to that serotype and short-term immunity to other DENV serotypes for months to years. Repeat infections with different serotypes can occur, particularly in DENV endemic areas. Approximately one in four DENV infections are symptomatic. Infection with any DENV serotype can cause severe illness, particularly in infants aged ≤1 year, pregnant women, adults aged ≥65 years, people with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/05/20240521_342849-B_PRESS_READY_PocketGuideDCMC_UPDATE.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;certain medical conditions&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and people with previous DENV infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, dengue cases have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="int"&gt;increased substantially in the last 5 years&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the most pronounced increases occurring in the Americas. &lt;a href="https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en.html" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;In the Americas region&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 4.6 million cases and 2,400 deaths were reported in 2023, followed by 13 million cases and 8,200 deaths in 2024. As of March 6, more than 760,000 dengue cases have been reported in 2025, which is a 15% increase compared to the previous 5-year average. Epidemics in the Americas region are expected to increase both travel-associated cases and the possibility of local transmission in the continental United States in areas with competent mosquito vectors. Spring and summer travel in the United States overlaps with the months of increased seasonal dengue activity in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four DENV serotypes were reported among travelers returning to the United States in 2024. DENV-3 was the most common serotype identified in 2024, but the proportion of cases caused by DENV-4 has been increasing in recent months. During October 2024–January 2025, DENV-4 was identified in 50% of travel-associated dengue cases among cases with DENV serotype available. In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-2-2025-paho-warns-increased-risk-dengue-outbreaks-due-circulation-denv-3-americas" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;DENV-3 has re-emerged after a prolonged absence in multiple countries&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the Americas region during 2024 and 2025. Introductions of new serotypes have been associated with increasing size and frequency of dengue outbreaks, as well as more severe clinical outcomes in patients with previous DENV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Puerto Rico, reported dengue cases have remained above the outbreak threshold since February 2024. A public health emergency was declared in March 2024 and remains in effect. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://datos.salud.pr.gov/arbovirus/publications" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;6,291 cases were reported&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 52% (3,292) required hospitalization and there were 13 deaths. As of March 7, 2025, 936 cases have been reported, representing a 113% increase compared to the same period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Virgin Islands, a dengue outbreak was declared in August 2024 and remains in effect. A total of 208 locally acquired cases were identified in 2024, and 30 in 2025 as of March 7, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the continental United States in 2024, locally acquired cases were reported in &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2025-7-arbovirus-surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Florida&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (91), California (18), and Texas (1). A record number of dengue cases were identified among U.S. travelers (3,483 cases), which is an 84% increase compared to the previous year. This trend is expected to continue with increased dengue activity in endemic areas in 2025. The highest numbers of travel-associated cases in 2024 were reported in &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2025-7-arbovirus-surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Florida&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1,016) followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/DengueInfectionsUpdate.aspx" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;California&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (648), and New York (327).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC will continue to support state, tribal, local, and territorial public health partners; clinicians; and public health laboratories in case detection, surveillance, and outreach to respond to the ongoing threat of dengue in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and be familiar with the recommendations for healthcare providers in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN (CDCHAN-00511)&lt;/a&gt; on dengue in the United States. This includes information about reporting cases, clinical presentation and care (including severe dengue), vaccination, testing, and patient outreach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a thorough travel history for patients presenting with acute febrile illness as initial clinical presentation is similar among many vector-borne diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html"&gt;Oropouche&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advise patients who plan to travel to take steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning, especially if traveling to an area with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areas-with-risk/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/around-the-world.html"&gt;frequent or continuous dengue transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to have increased suspicion of dengue among people with fever who have been in areas with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areas-with-risk/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/around-the-world.html"&gt;frequent or continuous dengue transmission&lt;/a&gt; within 14 days before illness onset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with suspected DENV infection should be tested with RT-PCR (i.e., a nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT]) or an NS1 antigen test, as well as with an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody test. These tests are available from commercial laboratories and public health laboratories. You can contact your &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/communications-resources/health-department-directories.html"&gt;state or local health department&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate dengue diagnostic testing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These tests can be considered regardless of the symptom onset date, although the sensitivity of RT-PCR and NS1 antigen tests decrease after the first 7 days of symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the patient test negative for dengue, consider testing for other infectious diseases that might be occurring in the location where the patient was likely exposed. Zika, chikungunya, and Oropouche can all have similar clinical signs and symptoms and often circulate in the same areas as dengue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Health Departments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and be familiar with the recommendations for state, tribal, local, and territorial Health Departments in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN (CDCHAN-00511) on dengue in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using the new &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/php/resources/medical_records_review.html"&gt;job aid for reviewing dengue medical records&lt;/a&gt; when reviewing data from medical records for case investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When selecting an RT-PCR assay, use the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR Assay&lt;/a&gt; when dengue is the most likely diagnosis. Use the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/123606/download" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Trioplex Real Time RT-PCR assay&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (approved under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration), when Zika is the most likely diagnosis. For samples testing negative for dengue, consider RT-PCR testing for Oropouche virus (OROV) based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;recent OROV circulation in locations visited.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trioplex Real Time RT-PCR assay, which simultaneously tests for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, is less sensitive for DENV-4 compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR assay&lt;/a&gt;, and DENV-4 has been detected more frequently among travelers returning to the United States in recent months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public health laboratories can request technical support and test kits at &lt;a href="mailto:denguePCRordering@cdc.gov"&gt;denguePCRordering@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:trioplexPCRordering@cdc.gov"&gt;trioplexPCRordering@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oropouche RT-PCR testing is available commercially and at selected state health departments and CDC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate, report, and respond to dengue cases and outbreaks in endemic and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/08/response_to_dengue.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;non-endemic areas of the United States.&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share guidance with the public about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/prevention/index.html"&gt;preventing dengue&lt;/a&gt; and other vector-borne disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
