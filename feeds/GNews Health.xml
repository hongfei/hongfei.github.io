						The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is warning residents and visitors about a dangerous bacterium that can cause a flesh-eating disease in a person who was swimming at a Cape Cod beach. A rare case of Vibrio vulnificus infection — a dangerous bacterium more commonly found in Gulf Coast states — was detected in a person who swam at a beach on Buzzards Bay, officials said."People with open wounds who spend time in the water, or those who consume contaminated shellfish, can develop an infection when the bacteria enter the body. Sometimes these infections can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe, even life-threatening illness," said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein.Some infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection in which the flesh around an open wound dies.There have been seven confirmed Vibrio vulnificus cases among Massachusetts residents in the last several years, including four that were likely exposed in the Bay State, officials said.People with liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or thalassemia and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of disease are at greater risk for severe disease from Vibrio following exposure.Anyone with an open wound, including one from a recent surgery, piercing or tattoo, should cover it with a waterproof bandage or stay out of coastal waters.In addition to wound infections, Vibrio bacteria can also cause gastrointestinal illness when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters.

Bromism, or high levels of bromide, was considered after a lab report and consultation with poison control, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84fa45" class="body-graf"&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64828e" class="body-graf"&gt;Once his condition improved, the man shared that he had taken it upon himself to conduct a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. The report said he did this after consulting with the chatbot ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7510a9" class="body-graf"&gt;He self-reported that the replacement went on for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65ba4e" class="body-graf"&gt;The three physicians, all from the University of Washington, noted in the report that they did not have access to the patient's conversation logs with ChatGPT. However, they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ece40" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the report, the response they received included bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d1e3e" class="body-graf"&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eea390" class="body-graf"&gt;A representative for OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning" target="_blank"&gt;noted in a statement to Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that its terms of service state that the bot is not to be used in the treatment of any health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4547cf" class="body-graf"&gt;"We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-71ac42" class="body-graf"&gt;Bromide toxicity was a more common toxic syndrome in the early 1900s, the report said, as it was present in a number of over-the-counter medications and sedatives. It was believed to contribute to 8% of psychiatric admissions at the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7be7f7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bromide salt, an inorganic compound, is now typically only used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic medication for cats and dogs, &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-Bromide" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5fa6dc" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;It's a rare syndrome, but cases have re-emerged recently "as bromide-containing substances have become more readily available with widespread use of the internet," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:17:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxON2hlMlJYTThQakN2WjhHYWhXMjZqQlBwV3pMWENfLVd5NDZXUFVrVW9PQWpneHNmQ3Z4VlRaTFo0RHpZQjZ4QnMxTFd2U3BzVkxVRlhYMWJJekhRMWFsTVVsR0VyTG5FZ3ZjZWNuc2Zlb19heUxjRTV6aTJqMWNKMWVhSVEtaEhmcVdwU0JEdmczZlRfbEI4d2ZjUlE1ZEIwUmkyQ09NSXJmdE9WaEZUcXc4Q2FRX0pk0gFWQVVfeXFMTm5fMk5uNkg2dllTQnJfQlpKRmw1QmdZVkVSdnZpamtWVG0yQzhTaHl5TkM5SVpCOWJPOXZMS1luemd0R3JKYklTVFZ5cGdLZnR0ZnJZMkE</guid></item><item><title>新的血压指南建议跳过酒精和提前开始治疗- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1tT1NudFVZMWJOWnhER1FuXzd1eUdQNEVSb19vTmlvRGR0Z29qak54VXZ1Wk1xX3pJUVZGZkZ6U2FuaHdxdU5RNTJna1JuenZCODRPX3l1RUVXRXhyYWFjQXMyVHkyVXBwOGIwM0JfMGVjcXFuOG1Oc29GRjjSAYIBQVVfeXFMT0FRWWZKbTFwNWE4ZmlEczlFTFJYaGFGMEJqU1FTQ0dnQ0Vadjl5eUhMdW1wcDdOT1ZlbUctQkRyeWRBdmpQWUhaWW1ldGdlU2I5ZDNLSlZVZlVJU3gtd29sTTFuSENzN2tJZk1RYUdOejBVMjBoWTdLVHNSaktUVmdNUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0002336nc35tw52g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0003336n3sm61ync@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0004336n8wqazbc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0006336nj3ga9sti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0007336n3m2s99ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0009336nay35v8ul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000b336n6zd4xwrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblho37000x336nemo36zop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000c336nn2rdw7mx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000d336ns716xoqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000e336n8w37gpk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000f336nfuwtu7qx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000g336nt8wtyhrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" target="_blank"&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000h336njjhb09c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000i336nsev8vtxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" target="_blank"&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000j336n9mtznh8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000k336nva3a7tyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Last year, my husband’s 90-year-old grandmother was diagnosed with dementia. Within the last few months, she has experienced a drastic decline in her ability to recognize people. She was very close with our son, and he doesn’t understand why she can no longer remember who he is. Can you offer any advice on how to explain this to him?&lt;/p&gt;

You might start with something like: “Your grandma is sick with something called dementia—which is not the kind of sickness that will get better, like when you get a cold. Her dementia means that her brain doesn’t work in all the ways it used to. That’s why she is sometimes confused, or doesn’t always remember your name. But your grandma still loves us very much.”&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure he knows it’s okay to feel sad or worried or upset about the changes he sees in her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk5l68000i3b7azi2bmoul@published"&gt;I always found books to be quite helpful when introducing my kids to new concepts. If you’re not sure where to start, I’m sure the children’s librarian at your local library will be able to help. Here is one &lt;a href="https://pennmemorycenter.org/books-to-teach-children-about-ad-dementia/"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of suggestions I found (with the caveat that I haven’t read these books myself).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk5laz000j3b7a50w8s2xe@published"&gt;If his grandmother’s dementia worsens and she starts to behave differently as a result, you should talk about that with him, too, so he understands that it is her disease causing the changes. While he’s still so young, it might be worth trying to talk with him every time you’re planning to go visit her, whether there’s been a change or no—both so that you can remind him of the situation, and give him an opportunity to share what he’s feeling or ask you any new questions that may have occurred to him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7481000q3b7akmg47jeq@published"&gt;I’ve got a 14-year-old son and 9-year-old twin daughters. My son lives primarily with his mom, but has always spent plenty of time at my place, and the kids are all quite close. But there is a real problem with how he treats one of his sisters. The two of them share many traits and are quite similar in disposition, and when things are good, they have a very sweet relationship. They’ll go on walks together and chat and laugh the whole time. They also really enjoy play-fighting—e.g., hitting each other with foam swords. But at other times, my son will relentlessly pick at his sister, teasing her for things like not being as good at video games as he is, or questioning her abilities in other ways. It’s unkind, and although she sometimes claps back or does her best to ignore him, more often it sends her into a rage.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="217" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7482000r3b7ap5h7rpps@published"&gt;I’ve talked to him about it repeatedly (and yelled at him about it), and he has said he has trouble controlling himself. Maybe that sounds like a cop-out, but having observed it so many times, I believe him. It seems like an impulse-control thing, like the comments pop into his head and are out of his mouth before he can stop them. We have a good amount of neurodivergence in our family, and I strongly suspect that, like the sister in question, he’s got ADHD. I’ve wanted to get him assessed, but his mom—with whom I have a good relationship—is resistant, and he hasn’t had any issues in school yet that would offer more reason to push for it. I’ll tell him to knock it off and he’ll be chastened, but then 30 seconds later he’s picking on his sister again. What do you think I should be trying to do here? Yelling obviously isn’t the answer, and I can tell my son is feeling demoralized. I feel like this is about their similar personalities to some extent, because he doesn’t have the same issue with his other sister. But even if that’s the case, I want him to stop cutting his sister down, because she adores him and I’m pretty sure he actually adores her too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000u3b7apfuzuv39@published"&gt;You didn’t mention what you’ve tried in terms of establishing clear limits or disciplining your son, but it’s clear that just talking to or reasoning with him hasn’t done the trick, nor has the fact that his treatment of his sister is having a negative impact on his relationship with the sister he presumably cares for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000v3b7ay45w4no5@published"&gt;While I’m obviously not trying to diagnose him (plenty of neurotypical teens also have impulse control issues!), you shared that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; strongly suspect he has ADHD or some other type of neurodivergence, and I don’t think you should ignore that instinct. You mentioned that you haven’t pushed for an assessment for your son because he doesn’t appear to be struggling in school. But a kid can be doing fine academically and still need help in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000w3b7an0he1oqg@published"&gt;Even if his apparent impulse control issues are not affecting his grades, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; contributing to unkind and/or uncontrolled behavior and negatively affecting his relationships at home. You’re constantly frustrated with him; your daughter is hurt; if things go on like this or get worse, there could be more serious harm done to those relationships. And if your son is really “unable” to control himself, you are probably not the only ones who will have to deal with his behavior—at some point, if it’s not already happening, others will too.&lt;/p&gt;

I also understand that you’re co-parenting with his mom and the decision of exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to help him change his behavior isn’t up to you alone. But when you’re truly stuck, when you’ve tried everything you can think of as a parent and nothing is getting better, that’s when it’s time to seek out more information and professional advice. I think you and your son’s mother need to have a serious conversation about this, and how to get your son the support he may need to better control himself, because the current situation is making at least two of your children unhappy and seems unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk34es000s4mm9g1gk6edb@published"&gt;My sister asked me to be the legal guardian for each of her children (11F and 10M) when she was pregnant, and I agreed without hesitation. At the time, I was young (23 when the oldest was born) and single. I lived about an hour away from them and figured if I did need to step in as their guardian and I didn’t have my own family established in my area, I would move to them so that the kids’ entire lives wouldn’t need to be uprooted in the wake of their parents’ deaths. I’m a teacher in a high-demand subject, so the ability to find a new job in a slightly different area isn’t of concern. When I started going out with my now-husband five years ago, I made sure he was aware of my agreement with my sister and my intent to fulfill it, if needed. He had no issue with it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/10/sister-tragedy-agreement-husband-parenting-advice.html"&gt;Well, I’ve had to make good on the agreement, and my life is a disaster.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public awareness remains low;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Oncology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is HPV, and what cancers is it linked to? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over 100 types;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13,000 new cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:do not cause symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How effective is the HPV vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: When is the vaccine recommended to be given?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Preteens should get the first dose of the HPV vaccine at 11 or 12, the CDC recommends. - John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is your takeaway from this latest report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

The system began decoding users’ internal speech – the silent dialogue in people’s minds — only when they thought of a specific keyword. This ensured that the system did not accidentally translate sentences that users would rather keep to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt; on 14 August, represents a “technically impressive and meaningful step” towards developing BCI devices that accurately decode internal speech, says Sarah Wandelt, a neural engineer at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, who was not involved in the work. The password mechanism also offers a straightforward way to protect &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;users’ privacy, a crucial feature for real-world use&lt;/a&gt;, adds Wandelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding eavesdropping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCI systems translate brain signals into text or audio and have become promising tools for restoring speech in people with paralysis or limited muscle control. Most devices require users to try to speak out loud, which can be exhausting and uncomfortable. Last year, Wandelt and her colleagues developed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01424-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01424-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the first BCI for decoding internal speech&lt;/a&gt;, which relied on signals in the supramarginal gyrus, a brain region that plays a major part in speech and language&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A participant in a red T-shirt looks at a screen that is displaying the words 'If there is a decision to make, they speak first.'" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;A study participant who has trouble speaking clearly because of a stroke uses the brain–computer interface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Emory BrainGate Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a risk that these internal-speech BCIs could accidentally decode sentences users never intended to utter, says Erin Kunz, a neural engineer at Stanford University in California. “We wanted to investigate this robustly,” says Kunz, who co-authored the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Kunz and her colleagues analysed brain signals collected by microelectrodes placed in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00078-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00078-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the motor cortex&lt;/a&gt; — the region involved in voluntary movements — of four participants. All four have trouble speaking, one because of a stroke and three because of motor neuron disease, a degeneration of the nerves that leads to loss of muscle control. The researchers instructed participants to either attempt to say a set of words or imagine saying them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings of the participants’ brain activity showed that attempted and internal speech originated in the same brain region and generated similar neural signals, but those associated with internal speech were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01001-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51086678.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain implant translates thoughts to speech in an instant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Kunz and her colleagues used this data to train artificial intelligence models to recognize phonemes, the smallest units of speech, in the neural recordings. The team used language models to stitch these phonemes together to form words and sentences in real time, drawn from a vocabulary of 125,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device correctly interpreted 74% of sentences imagined by two participants who were instructed to think of specific phrases. This level of accuracy is similar to that of the team’s earlier BCI for attempted speech, says Kunz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The first identified a promising starting point by searching through a library of millions of chemical fragments, eight to 19 atoms in size, and built from there. The second gave the AI free rein from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The design process also weeded out anything that looked too similar to current antibiotics. It also tried to ensure they were inventing medicines rather than soap and to filter out anything predicted to be toxic to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists used AI to create antibiotics for gonorrhoea and MRSA, a type of bacteria that lives harmlessly on the skin but can cause a serious infection if it enters the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Once manufactured, the leading designs were tested on bacteria in the lab and on infected mice, resulting in two new potential drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="MIT Prof Collins is leading on his laboratory bench, wearing a burgundy shirt, with an array of pieces of scientific equipment out of focus in the background." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Prof James Collins, one of the researchers at MIT&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're excited because we show that generative AI can be used to design completely new antibiotics," Prof James Collins, from MIT, tells the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"AI can enable us to come up with molecules, cheaply and quickly and in this way, expand our arsenal, and really give us a leg up in the battle of our wits against the genes of superbugs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, they are not ready for clinical trials and the drugs will require refinement – estimated to take another one to two year's work – before the long process of testing them in people could begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Andrew Edwards, from the Fleming Initiative and Imperial College London, said the work was "very significant" with "enormous potential" because it "demonstrates a novel approach to identifying new antibiotics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he added: "While AI promises to dramatically improve drug discovery and development, we still need to do the hard yards when it comes to testing safety and efficacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That can be a long and expensive process with no guarantee that the experimental medicines will be prescribed to patients at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some are calling for AI drug discovery more broadly to improve. Prof Collins says "we need better models" that move beyond how well the drugs perform in the laboratory to ones that are a better predictor of their effectiveness in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is also an issue with how challenging the AI-designs are to manufacture. Of the top 80 gonorrhoea treatments designed in theory, only two were synthesised to create medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Chris Dowson, at the University of Warwick, said the study was "cool" and showed AI was a "significant step forward as a tool for antibiotic discovery to mitigate against the emergence of resistance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he explains, there is also an economic problem factoring into drug-resistant infections - "how do you make drugs that have no commercial value?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If a new antibiotic was invented, then ideally you would use it as little as possible to preserve its effectiveness, making it hard for anyone to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAzbUZpMWRobi1sUGg0WkhUNnI0WXJ2Sl9VdFdpUkxWcjBsdDBmUnNQWnpWSUF0T0tUVVh1dk82TEJNX0g3eklJWk9xOUZpM3NmdTYxaXNwclcwUdIBX0FVX3lxTE82NUhkZGdLWHFiV2FRX1JTd1ZHazhzNXplOFQyYnJfTUxEUFk5M1ppNTZzNmg0MUgzSy1DeldQelFJNmI1MEJ2NnFqM04tSU9JVURDTjJVMkQ5MG9wRF9n</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，在科罗拉多州生长角状疣的“恶魔”兔子并不危险--《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A group of rabbits in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there is no reason to be spooked – the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/colorado","type":"Keyword","title":"Colorado"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/west-coast","type":"Keyword","title":"West Coast"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","type":"Keyword","title":"Wildlife"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/infectiousdiseases","type":"Keyword","title":"Infectious diseases"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/west-coast-news","type":"Tracking","title":"West Coast News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/aug/14/rabbits-horn-warts-colorado","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies”, “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits”. But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus probably influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr Richard E Shope, a professor at the Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105km) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; parks and wildlife, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency had been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she said that it was not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths do not harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家开发能够解码内部语音的大脑植入物-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complete digital access to quality analysis and expert insights, complemented with our award-winning Weekend Print edition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ</guid></item><item><title>您需要了解的关于抗癌HPV疫苗的信息- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBzQWdUM2NPdG9NdmVDLVF1V1NYTGlncmtiVzZDUms1VGR0QzJtejNxdXZCcUlWOS1lNnNtcGhzR1hwNWp4ZzhDZ3BXakU0Zkh4b2FPUFNtWHp6VERXdTA1RXBwYTVPNjJwVzNfT3dRX09yaFRRSUlpSUpjX0RyNVnSAYQBQVVfeXFMUGk1YWt1bFNNQmlnczRvSTZFMjdlTjhyS2d3QkxoMlliNml2Y00tWlRGaXJsVXRBeVp3MGlHcmRFSzJFRTN0c2l1UTM3T01ZNjdrMFVYLUVlZ05Hd0Z4SXhVMTNmMXl3d0VSb0tUaEhfRnR6U1B6RmdNU0lqYzRnT1ptbmEz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Imagine if there were a vaccine for breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer or any of the most well-known cancers that sicken and kill so many people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00023b6ni46ccaeq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every year, there are an estimated 48,000 new cases of cancers associated with the human papillomavirus, or HPV, in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/hpv-associated-cancers.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00033b6nihfqabaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00043b6n231ksah8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00053b6nn7wjf22i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00063b6n6zmqtugo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is HPV, and what cancers is it linked to? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00073b6n29o13nc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00083b6niz3pu3hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." target="_blank"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000b3b6n2zpoaf1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000c3b6nkwr3k2vf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." target="_blank"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000f3b6nd7wx69ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000g3b6ng92ih8oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000i3b6ndflqdt1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000j3b6n23gqfa3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;months later.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000k3b6nwpd81413@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000l3b6n3dkpm22u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" target="_blank"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published in the journal&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" target="_blank"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000m3b6nzp3svi53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All cases detected in Hawaii so far have been in people who traveled to regions where dengue is more common, so the agency warned people returning from endemic areas contact their doctor if they develop symptoms within two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus are usually found in tropical and subtropical regions like Central and South America, Africa, South Asia and the Pacific Islands.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, dengue is most prevalent in Florida, Texas and California, as well as the territory Puerto Rico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC data, Puerto Rico has reported the most dengue cases at 2,152 so far this year. Florida has seen 115 cases while California has seen 62. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease spreads through mosquito bites and cannot be transmitted from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 400million people get dengue fever every year but eight in 10 don't develop any symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who do usually experience a high fever, blotchy rash, muscle aches, joint pain and pain behind the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in rare and severe cases, the condition can cause vomiting or throwing up blood, intense joint pain and trouble breathing. These issues may further cause internal bleeding, leading to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirteen percent of patients die from the disease if they do not receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dengue is a potentially deadly virus passed to people by infected mosquitoes and was historically known as 'break-bone fever'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Emma Cox, 27, is one of those to report suffering from dengue fever. She had traveled to Indonesia, but 10 days after returning to the UK, she developed symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no antiviral for dengue fever, but the World Health Organization says that by rapidly replacing lost fluids the mortality rate drops to less than one percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A vaccine for dengue is available and approved by the FDA for children aged nine to 16 years old, but its manufacturer, French pharma giant Sanofi Pasteur, has discontinued production globally, citing a lack of demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doses are available in Puerto Rico, but these are expected to run out by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dengue cases have surged in Latin America, thought to be linked to the El Nino weather cycle at that time - which brings more heavy rains to areas of the continent - leading to more standing water in which mosquitoes can multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, rising temperatures have allowed mosquitoes to be active for longer each year and advance further north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In areas of the world where outbreaks are not as common, upticks are being linked in part to travel, leading to people who become infected abroad to enter the US then get bitten by a mosquito, which passes the virus to the insect and allows it to take root in the local mosquito population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC urges Americans traveling to high-risk areas to carry insect repellent, wear long sleeves and long pants outside and sleep in air-conditioned rooms or those with window screens to prevent being bitten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 14:14:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSHFzbUlYYTdDUVVxVGpkeUpPUjN6WWh0a1RBLU5UMkFIVFBBMV9ueWc1bUFOV2xqeDc3S3hJWS1WMVB3VmJQclFjeWZlUDN3aHh3RHdDNVBrUURhdVFPX2hYeUhwRGNKUG5fZUdTZDJNMjlSQkU0RHNWekZsLXp4REYwZWt4cjNZWkY0RllzZHR0WWFGT3dIbWpUQ1M0d3pkMHlPamc5aHkyMVHSAbABQVVfeXFMUFlvaThteExabUlSRVF5YVpfalZtUXRuZUg5VDloMFBqMUdleVhrTEdOeDdoQmtLUTk5VWlPWEpIN0RHejFIRFpnY2hYTEJ5ME9KdGcweGdQUmtJMFpIaXd3THdtYmpiVmpuVVJoX2NfMTdBTnItakRlS1NSOENUbXJTeGllV0o4V3M3bUE2RzlxWFhOXzNibFE5UE5qRk9YTUlkVVJUd3RGUko3dllaVXY</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.正在疫苗开发方面取得重大进展—这可能会危及我们所有人- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQN3ZPSkg2aEZRSUtXVWl0RnN5eFVsQ0lIZFFWYmlqaWRWU28tVkVMT29vNWlfSlhYSmFvcnR2VmxVdEVBd2IzWk5zN205TEtTWXh3UmEzZlJ1QTY0dHBfSm9LN2s5Wm1VZTJ0MU54WGRPWU5Fa2xQYlhlNV9DR3Utd3JEM1VFSnQ5YllLM3dseHM3aktCOExCRWM3b9IBoAFBVV95cUxQXzkzMXN0d3hjZklwWVlKd2JQVUZCd19zVldWTG80bzBqcnFZWHFEcmRGQ29lQW9KNW9PV1ZxcmJYWkl3Q0tIejFFT3REZkpnZ3FOZzl0RnU4dmk0QUxIY3F5N2NXOVRLNHBIVlBLRE5XWHNhb3JVbXZCYm5XV1Qta1N3UHN6N1Z4ck9UdVlzTTRadWwzY1phdHByYmZtZkxu?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/author/robert-f-kennedy-jr" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Robert F.

But, once again, he’s not right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He shouldn’t say anything.

As it spread, scientists in the United States researched how to make an mRNA vaccine for coronavirus in case it was needed (no vaccine was made or needed since it didn’t impact the U.S.), Offit explained. So, when SARS-CoV-2 came around in 2020, scientists had previous research to work from when developing a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Kennedy’s $500 million funding cuts to BARDA, “you lose a lot of that research development so that when the next pandemic comes in ... you won’t have that information.

And, either way, the cuts will have huge impacts on COVID and other disease research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But what people need to understand is that ... if you cancel research, even if it’s just for COVID or flu vaccine research, that built a lot of basic technology that you can use to treat other diseases. And so that’s now under threat,” explained Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is diagnosed with a cancer that doesn’t have a standard treatment, it’s important to fund research that’s finding new ways to treat that cancer, said Mukkamala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just imagine all of the countless lives that we could save if we funded science and made sure this technology was continued to be supported,” Tran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s funding cuts will make the U.S. — and the world — more vulnerable to disease outbreaks and less able to treat chronic illnesses, Tran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To cut the funding because you don’t think it’s a good way to treat COVID is indirectly saying, ‘I don’t think it’s a good big way to treat anything,’” Mukkamala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, Kennedy has praised mRNA technology when used for certain things, Offit said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it is ironic that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hails the work that was done at our hospital, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, for that small &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/childrens-hospital-penn-treatment-cps1-deficiency-20250515.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="child who had a liver enzyme defect" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899fff5e4b0c2e59a931a05" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.inquirer.com/health/childrens-hospital-penn-treatment-cps1-deficiency-20250515.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;child who had a liver enzyme defect&lt;/a&gt;, and that liver enzyme defect was ameliorated by providing him with the gene he needed ... so, we did a gene therapy on a little baby. Well, how was that gene therapy administered? With mRNA,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, on the one hand, [Kennedy] constantly criticizes the mRNA technology as a platform, and then on the other hand, he hails its technology when it’s used for gene therapy,” Offit noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked for comment, HHS spokesperson Nixon said, “HHS is continuing to invest in ongoing research on applications in cancer and other complex diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It further sows distrust in mRNA technology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Tran, targeting mRNA technology will create mistrust regarding mRNA-based technologies. (This comes at a time when vaccine hesitancy, in general, is at a high. Vaccination rates in kindergarteners &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/kindergarten-routine-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are decreasing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899fff5e4b0c2e59a931a05" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/kindergarten-routine-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;are decreasing&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistrust in mRNA has a chilling effect on all parties — patients may be wary of safe mRNA treatments, researchers may be less likely to study mRNA if they’re tracking the funding instability and pharmaceutical companies, which are very risk-averse, may not want to pursue frequently politicized mRNA technology, Tran explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be the difference between a patient receiving lifesaving treatment or that lifesaving treatment existing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to instill uncertainty in general, in terms of, is the FDA going to even be willing to consider this technology? Are they going to have this bias, regardless of what the data says?” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’ll set America back as a leader in science.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As projects are canceled, scientists may look to continue their research elsewhere, in places where it will be funded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that there are a number of people in this country who work on mRNA technology who will likely leave and go to other countries that are advancing the technology, including China and Germany and others,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to limit mRNA funding in the U.S. may benefit other countries that want to scoop up these researchers, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of things America does well. One of them is science. We are a beacon of science in this world. And I think that this dims the light,” Offit noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take time for projects to move overseas, said Tran, which will delay mRNA advancements. This could be deadly for folks with conditions that could benefit from these emerging treatments, Tran added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, if there is a time when we need mRNA technology from another country, we’ll be “shopping in the yellow pages,” said Mukkamala, and asking other countries what technology they have that we could use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s just not good as a leading country when it comes to research on this planet,” added Mukkamala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’ll hurt the economy and cause job loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond health impacts, these funding cuts will likely mean job loss, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those grants that were canceled were paying for research positions, and maybe some of those people will find new jobs, but some of them might not be able to, because that money is gone,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s going to be an economic factor to these funding cuts, she noted — “because not only is this money being used to further scientific progress and improve human health, but it’s also creating jobs and fueling local economies, and any type of cut is going to have impact on the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much impacting the economy right now, like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-tariffs-china_n_689a8838e4b08fd59b6441a5" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Donald Trump’s tariffs" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899fff5e4b0c2e59a931a05" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="689a8838e4b08fd59b6441a5" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="19"&gt;Donald Trump’s tariffs&lt;/a&gt; and more, it’s hard for folks to understand that these science funding cuts also have a big economic impact, Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are things you can do to advocate for science funding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to sit back and watch as this scary reality unfolds.

			&lt;p&gt;Ozempic and drugs like it have done wonders for weight loss by mimicking the natural hormone GLP-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;), which helps control blood sugar and appetite. Now a new study shows how gut microbe byproducts could have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteroendocrine_cell"&gt;Enteroendocrine cells&lt;/a&gt; (EECs) in the gut are responsible for producing natural GLP-1, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MED.0000000000000709"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a reduced number of EECs and lower GLP-1 production could be helping to drive obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using tests on rats and mini-guts grown in the lab (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organoid"&gt;known as organoids&lt;/a&gt;), researchers from Marshall University in the US have now confirmed a link between fewer EECs and obesity – and found a way to get the gut to make up the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-could-treat-chronic-migraines-trial-finds"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs Could Treat Chronic Migraines, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This points to a potential therapeutic strategy that leverages the gut microbes to improve metabolic outcomes in obesity," &lt;a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/news/musom-news/new-research-uncovers-gut-microbe-derived-metabolites-as-potential-therapy-for-obesity-related-metabolic-disorders/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Alip Borthakur of the Department of Clinical &amp;amp; Translational Sciences at Marshall University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers turned to supplements of the amino acid tryptophan to fix the EEC problem. Tryptophan was already known to promote &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.05.003"&gt;good gut health&lt;/a&gt;, in part through a metabolite (or biological byproduct) called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole"&gt;indole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170257" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/IndoleGraph.jpg" alt="Indole graph" class="wp-image-170257 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/IndoleGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/IndoleGraph-600x365.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170257" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Extra indole led to the gut signal changes the researchers expected. (Hart et al., &lt;em&gt;Int. J. Mol. Sci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the team was able to show in their work was that tryptophan and indole could form a production line to generate new EECs, and from there, more GLP-1. In other words, it promoted a more natural way of getting the same effect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-drug-for-weight-loss-works-with-just-one-monthly-dose"&gt;as a dose of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tryptophan is found in foods such as poultry, eggs, cheese, and certain seeds, and the thinking is that dietary supplements or probiotics of some kind could be used to drop the amino acid into the gut and start the necessary chemical chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that microbial metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan can reverse obesity-associated reductions in hormone-secreting gut cells," &lt;a href="https://jcesom.marshall.edu/news/musom-news/new-research-uncovers-gut-microbe-derived-metabolites-as-potential-therapy-for-obesity-related-metabolic-disorders/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Borthakur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to identify a specific cell receptor, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"&gt;aryl hydrocarbon receptor&lt;/a&gt; (AhR), through which this process occurs. That gives researchers a particular target to aim at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual treatments are still a long way off, but these initial findings are promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic is one of a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor antagonists, used to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170253" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/staggering-results-of-new-weight-loss-drugs-may-be-revolutionary-expert-says"&gt;as well as obesity&lt;/a&gt;. However, these treatments do come with side effects, and it would be preferable for our bodies to produce GLP-1 more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's part of the motivation for studies like this. In recent years, other teams of scientists have identified ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-found-a-natural-alternative-to-ozempic"&gt;tweak gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;adapt our diets&lt;/a&gt; to try and boost GLP-1 production in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the next steps will be to move these experiments out of rats and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="170253" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; and into actual human beings. While the lab tests carried out here do of course provide useful pointers for researchers, the processes and reactions inside people could vary &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-vital-fat-burning-protein-that-could-aid-weight-loss"&gt;in certain ways&lt;/a&gt; – which further studies can look into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The molecular players and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of EEC differentiation could be different in the normal and obese conditions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26157080"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26157080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: How much vitamin B12 should I take as a diabetic? -- T.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LAX2VYERH5EIJK5WELTC4T4HSU"&gt;ANSWER: Many people have strong feelings that vitamin B12 can dramatically improve their health, but it only helps to take vitamin B12 if you are deficient. Vitamin B12 deficiency isn’t too common. Still, there are a few situations where supplemental vitamin B12 should be considered, and two of them are specific for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZEMMBWGZZBDSTLGZOC46BFMATI"&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes, which usually presents itself during childhood, are at a high risk for other autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia -- an autoimmune destruction of the cells in the stomach that make a protein called intrinsic factor. This protein is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Multiple autoimmune diseases are often diagnosed in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JYOWZBLRCFAZ7GX7OP43YBONMY"&gt;People with Type 2 diabetes who take metformin are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor absorption. I recommend testing vitamin B12 in people who have been on metformin for a long time. Proton-pump inhibitors (like omeprazole) may also reduce B12 absorption to the point of deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y43JPAUPGBEYXPBKM4OTSFKXDI"&gt;People who are very strict with avoiding any type of animal products will develop B12 deficiency over the years unless they use supplements. Finally, people who can’t absorb nutrients for a variety of reasons (such as bariatric surgery, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm, and disease of the pancreas) may all become B12-deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TNLAO5XYOZDVNBKL3IRB7GYIPA"&gt;Treatment of B12 deficiency depends on the underlying cause. For example, a vegan only needs about 1 mcg a day to avoid B12 deficiency. By contrast, people with pernicious anemia need 1,000 times the usual oral dose of B12 or B12 injections.

ROACH: Is the Naltrexone shot (for alcohol abstinence) more effective when given on one side of the body compared to the other? A person I know who receives the shots feels that it’s only effective when they receive it on their right buttock. Is this possible, or could they be noticing a placebo effect? -- C.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YCZJBPUAZNATFJ45U44VC3RNV4"&gt;ANSWER: Naltrexone is an effective treatment for people with alcohol dependence. The exact effectiveness depends on the setting, but people who use naltrexone are less likely to relapse on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="632CJTWBHJDRHBK2BWEEKJS3CQ"&gt;Of course the drug will be absorbed just as well from the left side as the right. However, our expectations can have a huge influence on the effectiveness of a treatment. When there is an expectation of benefit, there is a placebo effect. (When there is an expectation of harm, it’s called a nocebo effect.) The placebo effect isn’t as critical in a situation like antibiotics for pneumonia but can be of immense importance when the desired effect is a decrease in alcohol cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TXN6GPXJBREYJHMZA7CHW4L73U"&gt;If I were this person’s doctor, I would keep giving the injection on their right side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4KNOMLENLBHFVE5NFCPPTXG6OE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

He called on the journal to “immediately retract” the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see no reason for retraction,” Dr Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals of Internal Medicine and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy’s piece, which was not submitted to the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies – especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before,” Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. “I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy had a number of criticisms, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions – including those with the highest levels of exposure – and that it did not include the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link. In fact, he said, its design was based on a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180331/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study led by Matthew Daley&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, which did show a link, and which Kennedy cited in his article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was no control group because in Denmark only 2% of children were unvaccinated, which was too small for meaningful comparison, Hviid added. The data was available for researchers to analyze, but individual-level data was not released under Danish law, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other prominent vaccine skeptics including those at the antivaccine organization Kennedy previously ran, Children’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Defense, have similarly criticized the study on the Annals of Internal Medicine site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;TrialSite staff defended the study for its scale, data transparency and funding while acknowledging the limitations of its design, a view seconded by some outside scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Laine said that while some of the issues Kennedy raised in his article may underscore acceptable limitations of the study, “they do not invalidate what they found, and there’s no evidence of scientific misconduct”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had “no further comment than what the secretary said”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQYllINkJWN2FTaXRtOWtSNTBuZ0ViRWRUYnp0MVhXbnhINVZ6bUhPUUlZTWRkM0xMWFJ0SV9xdnNjQXZWelFBY2FHbjM4ZkRkdlhBcFREc3d0V3l2RWw5UzltVzJ0eDI1OTBBbVJ1WTRWajlpTGZFeHdkZkJBYU9KMGNBTWQ1UElrMWNTaERtQktiNmxZ</guid></item><item><title>两种致命癌症的新疫苗在临床试验中显示出前景- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNOWRnWm9PWFE2c0ZKdVlNTHNGRTl3OXVyd1JRa29vNVpOcGpVNUNmZml5SEotckd0TWFNb19GaFBQLVBXWlhKOVZBX0FMNUdZZnZMRXl3ZVFFaFJrWHQySzctSzE2NjVuNHlTT0ZNUk5jNGRWTTZGN3NmOUc1RV80Q21SMU9YSXlrcDdaRXhDc1puWGZ4WFk4aXNvZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

These mutations are linked to 93 percent of pancreatic cancers and 50 percent of colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coupled with a delivery system that takes the vaccine's active agent straight to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;, the treatment is designed to precisely target parts of the immune system where a variety of immune cells are held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-diets-can-slash-cancer-risk-by-up-to-45-large-study-finds"&gt;Vegetarian Diets Can Slash Cancer Risk by Up to 45%, Large Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an exciting advance for patients with KRAS-driven cancers, particularly pancreatic  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171262" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, where recurrence after standard treatment is almost a given and effective therapies are limited," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical oncologist Zev Wainberg, from the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was tested on 20 people recovering from pancreatic cancer and five people recovering from colorectal cancer.

For cancers this aggressive, those are all impressive statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We observed that patients who developed strong immune responses to the vaccine remained disease-free and survived for much longer than expected," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wainberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the people who participated in the study, there was a median relapse-free survival of 16.33 months and a median overall survival of 28.94 months, both way beyond what's normally expected &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pancreatic-cancer/pancreatic-cancer-prognosis"&gt;in cancers like these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these results even better is that ELI-002 2P is what's known as an 'off-the-shelf' vaccine, which means it's a standard treatment that doesn't need to be personalized for each person (a process which takes time and expertise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional trials and testing will be necessary to fully evaluate the risks and benefits, but considering the high recurrence and mortality rates of pancreatic and colorectal cancers, there's strong evidence here that this vaccine could add years of health to people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also saw positive signs of the vaccine training the immune system to fight other types of cancer mutations too, so there's the potential for it to be even more useful in efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;improve treatments&lt;/a&gt; going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting KRAS has long been considered one of the difficult challenges in cancer therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/shelf-cancer-vaccine-elicits-strong-immune-response-patients"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wainberg. "This study shows that the ELI-002 2P vaccine can safely and effectively train the immune system to recognize and fight cancer-driving mutations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It offers a promising approach to generating precise and durable immune responses without the complexity or cost of fully personalized vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03876-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/03-Havers-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, 41 percent of children ages 6 months to 17 years hospitalized with COVID-19 from October 2022 to April 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Anders Pring recommends every child starting at age six months receive the “primary series,” the two initial doses. For older children, Anders Pring recommends getting an annual booster, just like the flu shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Naima Joseph, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Boston Medical Center, recommends pregnant patients also receive the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Insurance companies are mandated to cover ACIP’s recommendations. But since the panel’s final recommendation has not been released, insurance companies have promised to accept the guidance from medical societies, Joseph said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/articles/health-plans-continued-commitment-to-vaccine-access" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;America’s Health Insurance Plans&lt;/a&gt;, a national trade association representing the health insurance industry, stated in June that it is “committed to ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are hopeful that given AHIP has stated an intent to continue coverage of vaccines, it won’t be a problem,” Joseph said. “We will continue to partner with clinicians, pharmacists, community health workers to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The CDC still recommends the flu vaccine for everyone six months and older. But, in late June, Kennedy approved the CDC advisory committee’s recommendation to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;avoid thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; in flu vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thimerosal, a mercury-based chemical compound, is used like a preservative in multi-dose vials. The ingredient has long been pushed by the anti-vaccine movement as being connected to autism, though that &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/04/metro/vaccines-autism-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/04/metro/vaccines-autism-rfk-jr/"&gt;data was debunked&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The move should not affect the supply of flu vaccines, doctors said, as thimerosal is used in less than 5 percent of U.S. flu vaccinations. Manufacturers &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32711/HHS-approves-flu-vaccines-without-thimerosal" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;told the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;/a&gt;and The Globe that the decision should not impact their capacity to provide vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boston Medical Center is “proactive in looking at supply chains throughout the year to ensure that we have sufficient stock,” said Cassandra Pierre,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;an infectious disease physician there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, which causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract, primarily infects young children under 2 years old. It also impacts the elderly, especially those with weakened immune systems and chronic lung conditions. RSV infections are &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv#:~:text=Respiratory%20syncytial%20virus%20(RSV)%20infects,causes%20160%2C000%20deaths%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;usually mild&lt;/a&gt; in healthy people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As of Aug. 4, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommends RSV vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for all adults ages 75 and older, as well as adults ages 50 to 74 who are at increased risk for severe RSV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In June, the federal panel approved a recommendation for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;clesrovimab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody that prevents RSV, for infants under 8 months. There is no preferential recommendation between this antibody and another called nirsevimab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For pregnant women, the CDC recommends a single dose of the maternal RSV vaccine — in particular, Pfizer’s Abrysvo — during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy. The RSV vaccine given to mothers allows antibodies to be passed to the baby before birth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doctors agree that RSV vaccines are recommended for these populations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pneumonia vaccines are available throughout the year, Pierre said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; pneumococcal vaccination for children younger than 5 and adults 50 and older. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It also recommends it for individuals who have underlying health conditions that put them at high risk for severe disease. That includes people with HIV, asthma or significant pulmonary disease, or diabetes, according to Pierre.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="where_can_i_find_reliable_information_about" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom

She added state and local boards for public health are “wonderful unsung gems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Minnesota announced in July that it is teaming up with medical professional organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and American Academy of Family Physicians “to support the development of evidence-based guidance for flu, COVID and RSV immunization,” according to a press release. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While such resources exist, doctors ultimately urged patients to consult with their own clinicians. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From a public health perspective, we as pediatricians love to talk with our patients and work with them,” Anders Pring said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

While most bouts are caused by a virus or bacteria, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/symptoms-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), and aren't typically a cause for concern, there are also many common foods that can cause diarrhea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you suspect that food, rather than an illness, is causing your diarrhea (or other bothersome digestive woes), there's an easy way to identify the culprit. “The best way to investigate which foods are making your symptoms worse is to keep a food diary,” said gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://shilparavella.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shilpa Ravella, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shilpa Ravella, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;. Simply write down everything you eat each day, how you feel after eating, and if and when you have any unpleasant trips to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: Gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://shilparavella.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shilpa Ravella, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shilpa Ravella, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.metrohealth.org/physician/bhavesh-shah-029348" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bhavesh Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bhavesh Shah, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and Director of Advanced Endoscopy at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland; &lt;a href="https://celiacdiseasecenter.columbia.edu/about-the-center/celiac-disease-center-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of nutritional medicine in the celiac disease center at Columbia University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help streamline the process, we narrowed down the most likely foods that cause diarrhea. Ahead, GI doctors share the most common culprits to watch out for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugar Substitutes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet sodas and sugar-free snacks and chewing gum may help satisfy your sweet tooth, but many contain sugar substitutes that can also act as a laxative. “Sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and sorbitol can contribute to diarrhea and bloating based on how your body metabolizes them in the gut,” said gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.metrohealth.org/physician/bhavesh-shah-029348" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bhavesh Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bhavesh Shah, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of Advanced Endoscopy at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. Recent research in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)02607-X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iScience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;iScience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;also found that artificial sweeteners can alter the composition of the gut microbiome, disrupting the balance of healthy bacteria and further contributing to issues like diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Sammyvision - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your morning cup promptly followed by a rush to the bathroom? That’s pretty normal. In fact, up to 29% of people report feeling the urge to go after sipping a cup of coffee, according to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “Coffee can cause diarrhea in some people,” Dr. Ravella said. “The caffeine can stimulate the gut to contract more quickly than it normally does, so food moves through faster and isn’t absorbed as well.” The acidity of coffee can also worsen the symptoms of some digestive disorders, such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20496948/6-weird-signs-you-have-acid-reflux/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acid reflux;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;. Other caffeinated foods and drinks, including tea and energy drinks, could have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fotograzia - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a few too many during a night out (or in!), you may wake up with an upset stomach the next morning. “This is often a symptom that accompanies a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/life/a22789047/hangover-cures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hangover;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hangover&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shah said. “Alcohol is an irritant. Your gut may not agree with drinking a large amount.” Booze also speeds up digestion and pulls water into your digestive tract, per the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/diarrhea-after-drinking-alcohol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;—hence the liquid stools when you’re hungover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;marina200707 / 500px - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dairy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/documents/NICHD_MM_Lactose_FS_rev.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, up to 50 million American adults may be lactose intolerant and could benefit from limiting their consumption of dairy or cutting it out altogether. If your stomach goes rogue when you eat milk, cheese, or yogurt, you may be one of them. “Common symptoms, which begin about 30 minutes to two hours after consuming foods containing lactose, may be diarrhea, nausea, cramps, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20472936/best-remedies-for-gas-and-bloating/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gas, and bloating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gas, and bloating&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Image Source - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wheat, Rye, and Barley&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gluten—a mix of proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley—can cause diarrhea and bloating for up to 15% of people, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/nutrition/go-with-your-gut-4-facts-about-gluten-intolerance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwestern Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Northwestern Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping track of any GI symptoms you experience after eating bread, pasta, and grains or cutting out these foods to see if your symptoms disappear will help you find out if you're one of them. “If you think you have gluten intolerance, it’s important to see a gastroenterologist to make sure you don’t have celiac disease,” Dr. Ravella added. For people with this disorder, gluten can do serious damage by causing the body to attack the lining of the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;apomares - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Condiments and Salad Dressings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store-bought condiments, dressings, and sauces might contain traces of gluten in the form of ingredients like malt vinegar or wheat starch to help thicken the texture and add flavor, said &lt;a href="https://celiacdiseasecenter.columbia.edu/about-the-center/celiac-disease-center-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of nutritional medicine in the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University. Try preparing your own dressings and sauces at home if you have a gluten intolerance, or carefully read the ingredient labels at the store to avoid any hidden triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jeff Greenberg - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-FODMAP Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. They’re a group of carbs and sugar alcohols that can be tough to digest, especially for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Dr. Ravella said, leading to gas, bloating, and diarrhea. A &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-FODMAP diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; may help improve symptoms, but should be monitored by a dietitian, as it requires you to cut out certain foods rich in vital nutrients. According to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, High-FODMAP foods include dairy, wheat, beans, lentils, artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, onions, garlic, apples, cherries, and peaches, while foods low in FODMAPs include eggs, meat, rice, quinoa, potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, pineapple, and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Thanasis - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-Fiber Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber gets your digestive system moving, which is a good thing—but sometimes it’s a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; effective, Dr. Shah warned. Fiber binds with water, which can help prevent constipation but may also have a laxative effect if you consume too much at once. Plus, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/fiber-and-lactose" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCSF Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCSF Health&lt;/a&gt;, eating a lot of insoluble fiber (the type found in nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and whole grains) can speed up digestion, leading to watery stool. That's not to say you shouldn't be eating plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25922606/high-fiber-low-carb-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt;—just be sure to increase your fiber intake gradually until your stomach adjusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jordan Lye - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spicy Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can eat jalapeños like they’re candy, while others feel their stomach churn at the mere sight of a chili pepper. “Each individual is unique when it comes to tolerating spicy foods,” Dr. Ravella said. “Spicy foods can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, causing food to move more quickly through the gastrointestinal tract, which results in loose stools.” If you don’t eat spicy food often, she added, you’re more likely to feel the burn (and the potential digestive side effects) when you do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;by JBfotoblog - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fast Food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need motivation to skip the drive-thru window, consider that greasy takeout grub can be hard on your gut. “In general, all fats can be harder to digest, but the worst culprits are the fats in greasy, fried foods typically found at fast food restaurants,” Dr. Ravella said. “You’re less likely to have issues when eating healthy fats from whole foods, like avocados.” Indeed, a recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/11/1838" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that fast food consumption was associated with an increased risk of having inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, making issues like diarrhea that much more likely to occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Cavan Images - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Packaged Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like fast food, processed and packaged foods from the grocery store often contain lots of the hard-to-digest ingredients listed above. Be sure to read nutrition labels and ingredient lists carefully, and be on the lookout for gut-irritating and hard-to-digest ingredients like sugar substitutes, dairy, gluten, or FODMAPs.

And if you’re experiencing any of these challenges, here are expert-backed strategies to help improve your sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sleeping And Waking At Atypical Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though often seen as simply being a night owl, there’s actually a strong neurological overlap between ADHD and circadian rhythm disruptions like delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People with ADHD often experience a delayed release of melatonin, making it harder to feel sleepy at conventional times,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brentwoodtherapycollective.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Chelsea Sarai" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899d32fe4b07d71851cbd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.brentwoodtherapycollective.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Chelsea Sarai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, clinical psychologist and founder of the Brentwood Therapy Collective. “Combined with difficulty transitioning between tasks and regulating internal cues, their sleep-wake cycles naturally shift later and later, often without them realizing it.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain of someone with DSPS is wired to come alive at night, which makes it challenging to match typical daily routines. A way to gradually shift one’s sleep schedule earlier is by getting exposure to natural light in the morning to help reset the body’s internal clock. “In the evening, reducing blue light exposure and maintaining a consistent wind-down routine can reinforce those shifts,” Sarai said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Difficulty ‘Shutting Off’ The Brain At Night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feeling physically tired but mentally alert can lead to long nights awake, and growing sleep debt. “A hallmark of ADHD is difficulty regulating attention, not just focusing when needed, but also knowing how to mentally disengage,” Sarai said. “At night, when external distractions fade, the brain suddenly has space to process everything that’s been pushed aside during the day. This often leads to a surge of racing thoughts or mental ‘noise’ that makes it hard to wind down and fall asleep.” These thoughts can resemble anxiety, but Sarai notes they’re not always anxious — they might be creative ideas or hyperfixations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be realistic about how long it takes to fall asleep and create a wind-down routine to support it. “It could look like writing down all the thoughts in one’s head before bed as a way to honor those creative thoughts and trust that you will get back to them at a more appropriate time,” Sarai said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Trouble Waking Up Despite Adequate Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trouble waking up despite getting enough sleep is often brushed off as laziness, poor self-discipline or even a sign of depression. But in many cases, it can be attributed to having a delayed circadian rhythm and the ADHD brain struggling to shift from sleep to wakefulness, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Zishan Khan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899d32fe4b07d71851cbd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mindpath.com/clinicians/zishan-khan-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Zishan Khan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and regional medical director at Mindpath Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Low dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the morning can also lead to grogginess, poor motivation and difficulty activating for the day,” he added. He suggests regulating the sleep-wake cycle by implementing consistent bedtimes and wake times, even on weekends, and using visual cues or alarms that gradually increase in volume or light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Using Screens To Fall Asleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those with ADHD often turn to screens to calm a restless mind. “The sensory stimulation — visual, auditory or narrative — can help distract from intrusive thoughts or anxiety, making it easier to drift off,” Khan said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For some, screens even mirror the level of internal alertness they’re used to, which paradoxically helps them settle. But because screens suppress melatonin and delay sleep onset, even if someone falls asleep while using one, their sleep quality may still suffer from continued stimulation or disrupted sleep cycles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support better sleep, try gradually replacing screen time with low-stimulation options like audiobooks, white noise or guided meditations. “Establishing a 30- to 60-minute wind-down period before bed is crucial, ideally involving non-screen activities that still provide sensory regulation, such as dim lighting, gentle music or tactile tools like weighted blankets,” Khan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Bedtime Procrastination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delaying bedtime despite knowing it’s time to sleep is often tied to poor time perception and difficulty shifting away from preferred activities. “People with ADHD may hyperfocus on an enjoyable task late into the evening or delay sleep because it represents the end of their ‘free time’ after a demanding day,” Khan said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In kids and teens, this can be mistaken for defiance. A consistent, rewarding bedtime routine with built-in cues and transitions can help. “Visual timers, reminders and positive reinforcement can help signal the winding-down process,” Khan said. “For those with ADHD, it’s key to build in extra time for this process, as it often takes longer than expected to shift gears.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Frequent Middle-Of-The-Night Wakeups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with ADHD often &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10761352/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="experience fragmented sleep" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899d32fe4b07d71851cbd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10761352/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;experience fragmented sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; due to arousal dysregulation and heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli like noise or light. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When they wake, which is normal even for good sleepers, they may struggle to fall back asleep due to intrusive thoughts or urges to engage in stimulating activities,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.werisepsychology.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Nicole Moshfegh" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6899d32fe4b07d71851cbd06" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://www.werisepsychology.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Nicole Moshfegh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a licensed clinical psychologist and director of We Rise Psychology, Inc. These disruptions can prevent the brain from cycling through all the important stages of sleep, especially deep and REM sleep, leading to grogginess, reduced focus and memory, and less impulse control the next day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you wake up at night, avoid checking the clock or using screens, which can increase alertness. Instead, Moshfegh suggests practicing stimulus control: if you’re awake for 15 to 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, dim-light activity like reading or stretching until you feel sleepy. “This helps recondition the brain to associate the bed with sleep, not wakefulness.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Oversleeping On Days Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sleeping in on days off often reflects an attempt to make up for late or inconsistent bedtimes during the week. “Without external structure, they revert to their intrinsic rhythm of going to bed and sleeping in later,” Moshfegh said of those with ADHD. “Oversleeping on weekends leads to social jet lag, a mismatch between biological and social clocks.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can make it harder to fall asleep Sunday night and leave you tired at the start of the week. To keep your sleep on track, stick to consistent wake-up times and get morning light, either by going outside or using a light therapy box, within 30 to 60 minutes of waking. “This light acts as a strong cue to anchor your internal clock and reduce daytime sleepiness,” Moshfegh said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In reality, McDonald’s has its place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ahead, nine nutritionists shared whether they let their kids eat McDonald’s, plus when and why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes — but she mainly focuses on home-cooked meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.racheltrotta.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rachel Trotta" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="http://www.racheltrotta.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rachel Trotta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a fitness nutrition specialist and personal trainer, said her approach is “not necessarily a ‘let’ situation,” but focused on shaping healthy attitudes toward food and not setting food “rules.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stocks the house with whole foods, cooks most meals at home and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fresh-fruit-produce-container_l_66a13fb1e4b08943f2a20dee" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="brings fruit" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66a13fb1e4b08943f2a20dee" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brings fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for on-the-go snacks. At the same time, she doesn’t believe in being full-out anti-McDonald’s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I know that occasionally having fast food (without negative commentary) keeps it in perspective instead of blowing it out of proportion,” Trotta said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her 5-year-old daughter has actually never had McDonald’s, but not because it’s forbidden, she clarified. Again, Trotta’s focus is on helping her daughter shape a healthy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;relationship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; with food. This looks like encouraging her to listen to her body, such as eating when she’s hungry and stopping when she’s full. That is what sets her daughter up well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I know when she does have the opportunity to eat more fast food, she’ll be able to trust her own internal compass,” Trotta said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes — in a flexible way and without moralizing it &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/julia-cassidy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Julia Cassidy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/julia-cassidy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Julia Cassidy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a dietitian and eating disorder specialist with Eating Recovery Center, believes that food is just food; it doesn’t need moral judgment. Further, she said labeling certain foods as “off limits” or “junk” can set kids up for shame, secrecy or an unhealthy relationship with eating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t view McDonald’s — or any food — as ‘good’ or ‘bad,’” she said. “My sons eat at McDonald’s sometimes, and I treat it the same way I would at any other meal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A McDonald’s meal can have many legitimate purposes, too. For Cassidy, it’s been about convenience, genuinely enjoying the food, or a family tradition, like a chicken nugget meal on the way to a ballgame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar to Trotta, she doesn’t make a big deal about a McDonald’s meal and focuses on modeling balance. Some meals are McDonald’s, and some meals are home-cooked. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the long run, this approach supports food flexibility, reduces guilt and protects against the kind of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/orthorexia-is-more-and-more-common-heres-what-you-should-know-about-it-goog_l_683887bfe4b06202aa9171cc" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="rigid thinking that can contribute to disordered eating" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="683887bfe4b06202aa9171cc" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;rigid thinking that can contribute to disordered eating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” Cassidy said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes — but only for special occasions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stjudewellnesscenter.org/meet-our-dietitians/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Megan Wroe" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://stjudewellnesscenter.org/meet-our-dietitians/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Megan Wroe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a registered dietitian with St. Jude’s Wellness Center, doesn’t consider any food to be an “absolute no,” knowing that strict restriction can lead to unhealthy food relationships. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That said, I don’t go out of my way to get fast food of any kind for my kids,” she added. “I believe in providing as much real, homemade food as possible and reserving fast food for special occasions or for days when our schedule absolutely demands it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes — but rarely, and more in social situations &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inessawellness.com%2Fen-us%2Fpages%2Fabout" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Liza Marogy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inessawellness.com%2Fen-us%2Fpages%2Fabout" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Liza Marogy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; a registered nutritionist in England with two decades of experience, said she wouldn’t choose to take her child to McDonald’s, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; there are rare occasions when she would take them, like a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/experts-weigh-in-on-birthday-party-etiquette_n_656a3d11e4b066e398b78ee5" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="birthday party" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689a23a0e4b0c2e59a932ef8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="656a3d11e4b066e398b78ee5" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;birthday party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;

More than 1.9 million new cases were reported in 2020, claiming over 930000 deaths worldwide. According to the data by the WHO, the global burden will increase to 3.2 million new cases (an increase of 63%) and 1.6 million deaths per year (an increase of 73%) by 2040. Early diagnosis is crucial for better treatment outcomes, survival rates, and quality of life. Dr. Megan Rossi, a leading gut health scientist and registered dietitian, has stressed about catching the warning signs of bowel cancer early. “While I was studying at university, my grandmother was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Despite undergoing treatment, she passed away not long after. Would her story have been different if we’d talked more openly about the warning signs? I think about this a lot. Early detection is so important,” she said, recalling a personal experience. Before we delve deeper into the symptoms of bowel cancer, let’s understand what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Want to live longer? Science says eating more protein might be the answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is bowel cancer&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer, also known as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK586003/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, affects the colon (large intestine) or rectum. Depending on where they start, these cancers can also be called colon cancer or rectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cancer can lead to severe harm and even be terminal. It also affects the quality of life in survivors, which is why catching the early signs are crucial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the warning signs of bowel cancer&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer often has no symptoms in the early stages. However, some may experience the following signs, which are easy to dismiss as common illnesses. “Get familiar with the symptoms. Don’t ignore changes in your gut because early diagnosis can save lives,” Dr. Rossi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think the rise in bowel cancer rates is due to diet changes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 5 warning signs include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss (5%+ of your bodyweight)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncomfortable and constant bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in your poop (which may look red or black)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in your bowel movements [that aren't usual for you)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue that doesn't improve with rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bowel cancer is on the rise&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidence of bowel cancer is increasing. Why? “Rates of bowel cancer are rising globally, and it’s those born after 1990 who are seeing the sharpest increase. One big reason? We’re uncovering that our shift away from traditional diets (think high-fibre, plant-rich foods) to more ultra-processed foods, red and processed meat, and added sugars, is (in part) to blame,” Dr. Rossi said, in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIVpJZxsUsU/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent bowel cancer &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rossi noted that “54% of all bowel cancer cases are thought to be preventable.” She emphasized the importance of trying to control some of the lifestyle factors that increase the risk. These include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat a nutritious and well-balanced diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop or limit alcohol intake &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage your stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where to begin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut health and nutrition expert advises starting with fiber. “A study in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6617" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that for every additional 10g of fibre you eat daily, your risk of colorectal cancer drops by 10%. Yet most of us aren’t hitting the recommended 30g daily target - never mind the 30+ plants a week for gut diversity. If you do just one thing this week, add one extra portion of plants from the Super Six (wholegrains, nuts and seeds, fruit, veg, legumes, and herbs and spices) to your meals,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get the latest news updates on Times of India, including reviews of the movie &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/coolie-movie-review-release-live-update-rajinikanth-nagarjuna-aamir-khan-shruti-haasan-coolie-review-and-box-office-collection/liveblog/123291177.cms" title="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/coolie-movie-review-release-live-update-rajinikanth-nagarjuna-aamir-khan-shruti-haasan-coolie-review-and-box-office-collection/liveblog/123291177.cms"&gt;Coolie &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/war-2-movie-review-release-live-update-hrithik-roshan-kiara-advani-tiger-shroff-jr-ntr-war-2-review-and-box-office-collection/liveblog/123291132.cms" title="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/war-2-movie-review-release-live-update-hrithik-roshan-kiara-advani-tiger-shroff-jr-ntr-war-2-review-and-box-office-collection/liveblog/123291132.cms"&gt;War 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 10:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxPZmFhMTZfajBad3dVUE5hZy16RjdUaGlCNFgxQzBrLWRJMGZMVjAtaHNoMkV5Z2tORmE4RVNmOVhuVmRnRzFLUnBPWDNLRHFucHJXdnN6eVRzd0FmYWNkblp1dlZmR2RuWDNaMjhBdVhuSFlQTU5RcGFyZjlST1IzcnZHeHZha1gzUm5WSHB4LVAwbTFIaVhreTRoMGlsT0p4emhXbUpOd3FLTHJDV3BZanc3VG5XN3otV0hMc1dieTJ2b2VGQWpnSzIzaWZXYm05S3NscjRWaEVSTTc5NkVUYkZWMUVqdmIzY0oyOW5hTVpTb1E4UWV2ampRYjN5MWNPRl9vcVlYbGxYLWpfX1ROVHNR</guid></item><item><title>美国向5个国家/地区发出旅行警告： “采取强化预防措施” - Syracuse.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DM6E5U55A5GEDM2OVBN74YZYFQ"&gt;The United States has issued a travel warning for Americans traveling to five countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KN4WL26P75CEXNRNFEQTALWQYQ"&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an update to its &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices"&gt;global travel alert&lt;/a&gt; that polio is circulating in Finland, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Kenya.

Most people with polio do not feel sick or suffer minor symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, nausea, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the arms and legs. In rare cases, polio causes permanent loss of muscle function (paralysis) and can be fatal if the muscles used for breathing are paralyzed or if there is an infection of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F4O5MCYS4NEWNBYO73YEENY5VI"&gt;Besides getting vaccinated, the CDC urged travelers to wash their hands regularly and avoid contaminated water and foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GM33ZYCKQ5GMPBR4J4VPWIVKIY"&gt;“Good hand washing practices can help prevent the spread of this disease. Because the virus that causes polio lives in the feces (poop) of an infected person, people infected with the disease can spread it to others when they do not wash their hands well after defecating (pooping),” the CDC said. “People can also be infected if they drink water or eat food contaminated with infected feces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

We give so much of ourselves to other people as nurturers that we lose ourselves in the process,” says the photographer, 44. “It wasn’t a midlife crisis, but an awakening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do I want a divorce or is this &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/06/29/ovary-menopause-womens-health-longevity-impact/83815618007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;? It’s a question resonating with women in midlife, when hormones are changing as their stress is increasing – kids moving out and parents moving in and careers often at their peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While divorce rates overall are dropping, divorce among adults 50 and older is increasing. In 1990, almost one in 10 of all divorces in the United States occurred among adults 50 and older. By 2019, that percentage had grown to almost one in four, according to a study done by &lt;a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/college-of-arts-and-sciences/NCFMR/documents/RBT/charting-marriage-and-divorce-2023-marriage-ud-2024-10-10-kkp-cs.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bowling Green State University’s National Center for Family and Marriage Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bowling Green State University’s National Center for Family and Marriage Research&lt;/a&gt;.

More women are recognizing its symptoms and saying it can bring clarity: their patience is gone and they are finally prioritizing their own needs. And often that means no longer wanting to be married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seven in 10 women blame perimenopause or menopause for the breakdown of their marriage according to a survey conducted in the UK by the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/family-law-menopause-project-newson-health-research-partner-shahzady/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Family Law Menopause Project and Newsom Health Research and Education.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Family Law Menopause Project and Newsom Health Research and Education.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa McClure says perimenopause helped give her the clarity that she wanted a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McClure ended her marriage three years ago and says she is happier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;I love my husband, but I hate him&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While most women say many factors led to their divorce, they often say perimenopause or menopause made them unable to tolerate problems they had ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I hear it from patients every week,” says &lt;a href="https://www.cgcchicago.com/team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sameena Rahman;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sameena Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, an OB-GYN and sex and menopause specialist in Chicago. “They might still love their husbands or partners but they also hate them and no longer can put up with things they had been putting up with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sameena Rahman is an OB-GYN in Chicago who specializes in perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Perimenopausal and menopausal women can experience a range of symptoms from lack of sex drive to restless sleep at the same time that their life may become increasingly stressful with raising children and managing demanding careers, Rahman says. Perimenopause often starts around 40 and menopause around 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many women say they no longer can carry the majority of the &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/07/31/mental-load-definition-how-to-fix/85248599007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mental load;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mental load&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our hormones give us this protection to accommodate other people.

My wife is crazy,” she says. “But that’s not it. Women are gaining clarity in perimenopause and that clarity tells them to leave if things aren't good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Katy Viva got divorced last year after 24 years of marriage and raising three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While the kids were growing up, there was always something. Basketball, hockey, volleyball, gymnastics. You spend 15 to 20 years getting three people to three different places. You don’t really have time to stop and reflect on what is the status of your relationship,” says Viva, 53, who lives in Pittsburgh. “Once the kids are done with that kind of thing, you step back and realize: I’m married to someone I don’t want to be married to anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Viva says menopause left her tired and irritable. “I don’t know if it caused the divorce. But I will say that menopause made me unwilling to put up with the bullshit anymore,” Viva says. “Life is too long. Not too short. I’ve got time left in me and I don’t want to spend it with someone that I don’t respect who doesn’t love me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menopausal women are often misdiagnosed: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/23/hormone-therapy-estrogen-perimenopause-antidepressants/85282744007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This mom was told she had depression and put on an SSRI.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;This mom was told she had depression and put on an SSRI.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Did she want a divorce or was it perimenopause?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For some women, getting help for their symptoms improves their relationships. They feel better and can have better with their partner about changes such as decreased sex drive, fatigue and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dixon says that sometimes perimenopause forces conversations where men can step up and become better partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Donna Hofmeister first started going through perimenopause, she no longer felt like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It takes a toll on your relationship - not having sex, feeling tired, gaining weight," says Hofmeister, 55. "You can't help it and you don't know why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hofmeister eventually got hormone therapy and helped her husband understand what she was experiencing. "He’s a wonderful guy. He wanted me to feel better but didn’t know what to do," she says. "It puts such a strain on your relationship. But taking about it helped. It's what got us through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The majority of women who had not received support or treatment for menopause said that if they had, it would have had a positive impact on their relationship and potentially avoided the breakdown of their marriage, according to the 2022 UK study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How to survive perimenopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get help.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t go through perimenopause without proper guidance.

"If you just give them plants, they're very high in fibre. It fills them up, and then there's a risk that they may not then be able to consume enough nutrients because the nutrient density can be very low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Fewtrell has co-authored &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/5/723" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522007341?via%3Dihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vegan and vegetarian&lt;/a&gt; children who don't supplement are at risk of being deficient in Vitamin B12, iodine and iron.

                There's a growing consensus among researchers on how many daily steps are needed to improve health.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;From pricey wearable devices to your phone, it has never been easier to track your daily physical activity, or lack of it. And if you're like many Americans — and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8595506/" target="_blank"&gt;spend 9-plus hours&lt;/a&gt; sitting everyday — chances are you could probably stand to&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213518585/so-much-sitting-looking-at-screens-can-we-combat-our-sedentary-lives" target="_blank"&gt; take a few more steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But just how many should you aim for if you want to live a longer and healthier life? New research suggests 7,000 is a good target.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have made big strides in the science of step-taking over the past decade, gathering tons of data.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And no surprise, they find the more you move, the less likely you are to die from cardiovascular disease and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, they've also concluded that the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/29/727943418/do-you-really-need-10-000-steps-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;widely-cited target&lt;/a&gt; of 10,000 steps is not rooted in solid science — it grew out of a Japanese promotional campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, a number of studies have now landed on a new number to keep in our heads as we trudge through the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;7,000 steps tends to be the range where there seems to be diminishing return on investment for increasing more steps," says &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/melody-ding.html" target="_blank"&gt;Melody Ding&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ding is the latest researcher to dive into the evidence, as part of an effort to update the physical activity guidelines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her team reviewed data collected from more than 160,000 adults around the world on the link between step count and a variety of health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among their findings: Taking 7,000 steps per day was associated with nearly a 50% lower risk of dying compared to the bare minimum of 2,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study,&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; also showed the chance of developing cancer fell by 25%, type 2 diabetes 14%, cardiovascular disease 25%, symptoms of depression 22% and dementia 38%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Ding says there were still &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvements for those who exceeded 7,000 steps, but overall they saw "diminishing returns on investment," meaning the added health benefits across the population become smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It definitely doesn't do harm if you go beyond 7,000," she says, "So for anyone who's already doing 10,000 and more, there is no point of going back, but for the folks who are finding it harder to get there, 7,000 could be a really realistic target."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research underscores that, on the lower end, even a modest jump in steps can have a major impact on your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, simply jumping from 2,000 to 4,000 steps in a day was accompanied by nearly a 36% lower risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The work from Ding's team reflects a growing consensus in the scientific literature that around 7,000 steps could be a reasonable target for the public. (There is some variation in the exact number depending on the study.) &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/about/directory/amanda-paluch" target="_blank"&gt;Amanda Paluch&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783711" target="_blank"&gt;published two meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; on step count and health, has found a similar range as this latest study, though her work suggests the step targets may also vary with age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were seeing that older adults did not seem to need as many steps compared to younger adults," says Paluch, a physical activity epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Specifically, Paluch's &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the decreased risk of dying appeared to plateau between 6,000 to 8,000 steps for people in their 60s and older, versus 8,000 to 10,000 for younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says this latest study is one of the first to consider a broader array of health outcomes than just mortality and cardiovascular disease, but cautions some of the results, such as those related to cancer, depression and dementia, are still somewhat "preliminary" because they're based on only a few studies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have also tried to pin down whether speed makes a difference. Here, the new &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study could not make any definitive conclusions, in part because there are various ways to measure intensity and differences could simply reflect better overall fitness and physical function.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We actually don't see an association once we consider the total number of steps," says Paluch, who has also looked at this question. "So, essentially, the total number of steps, regardless of how fast you're walking, seems to have a benefit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal government's current &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/PAG_Advisory_Committee_Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;physical activity guidelines&lt;/a&gt; don't actually recommend a daily step target. Instead, they focus on time, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/php/guidelines-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommending 150 to 300 &lt;/a&gt;minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week for adults, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/william-erle-kraus" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Kraus&lt;/a&gt;, who worked on those guidelines, would love to see steps included the next time they are updated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Because they're objective measures that anyone can get off their phone, right?" says Kraus, a cardiologist whose lab studies exercise and health at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says ultimately both approaches to measuring physical activity reflect the same thing  — the amount of energy being burned up through movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What you're seeing is the more energy expenditure that you consume with physical activity, the greater benefit you get," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And because the point is to get physical activity – and expend energy – it doesn't have to be just steps. Kraus says you can translate one mile of walking into one fifth of a mile swimming, or five miles cycling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Melody Ding at the University of Sydney says she likes to think of movement in the same way as diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just like we need a balanced, healthy diet, it's important for us to have balanced physical activity, training throughout the week as well," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In other words, get those steps, but also make time for mobility and strength training. All of it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you are counting steps, Kraus emphasizes that the evidence pointing to roughly 7,000 steps a day should not discount the value of doing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; steps, even if the upsides that have been studied so far become incremental above that number.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everybody wants to know how little I need to do. That is the wrong question," he says, "Anything is better than nothing, more is better than less."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What's more, the calculations appear to change when you factor in how much time people spend sitting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He cites &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27475271/" target="_blank"&gt;evidence that suggests&lt;/a&gt; people need to aim higher than 7,000 or even 10,000 if they spend eight hours in a chair.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you can get 13,000 steps, you can get rid of all the negative risks that are associated with sitting, " he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Legionella bacteria can form in the cooling towers atop buildings and spread through the air, potentially infecting people whether they live in a building or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="acg1c"&gt;But some residents said that's left them wanting more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9uhed"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gothamist analyzed&lt;/a&gt; nearly a decade of publicly available inspection and violation data from the five ZIP codes to give a clearer picture of how the city has enforced safety rules meant to prevent Legionnaires' outbreaks. We found that while the number of inspections citywide has dropped dramatically since Mayor Eric Adams took office, they dropped more precipitously in the five affected ZIP codes identified by the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9avj5"&gt;The health department did not respond to questions about whether increased testing could have helped prevent the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cc4rt"&gt;Here's what else we discovered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="falg7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How many cooling towers are in the affected ZIP codes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="brrgn"&gt;Thousands of the city’s buildings have rooftop cooling towers, which circulate water through air conditioning systems. But the warm water that pools in their tanks can become an incubator for potentially deadly Legionella bacteria, which can grow to dangerous levels within two weeks if left unchecked, according to public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4tgps"&gt;Once that bacteria becomes vaporized into the air, breathing it can result in Legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia. The outbreak in Harlem that started in late July has so far hospitalized more than 20 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d501c"&gt;As of Aug. 13, there were 97 cooling towers in the 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039 ZIP codes. The 10027 ZIP code, which contains Morningside Heights, Manhattanville and Central Harlem, accounts for more than half of those, with a total of 50 cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5rt1r"&gt;It’s a fraction of the 4,929 towers spread across all of New York City. But Manhattan has the most by far, with 3,635, about three-quarters of the total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="2lh4n"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much have inspection numbers declined in those ZIP codes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8v8ph"&gt;First, a little background: A &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015 city law&lt;/a&gt; passed in the aftermath of a historic outbreak that killed 16 allows the city to inspect cooling towers for compliance. Those inspections got off to an aggressive start in 2017, with 5,095 conducted that first year. The number plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7mlmr"&gt;By 2022, they were back to 4,443, but have dropped again to a near-pandemic low since Adams entered office. This year, the city is set to inspect less than half of the towers it did at the start of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="26dfp"&gt;That decline has been even more pronounced in the ZIP codes where the outbreak is concentrated. A record number of towers, exactly 100, were inspected in 2021. In the first four months of 2025, however, the city was on track to inspect only about a quarter of that number, although the current outbreak likely led to an increase in inspections in those neighborhoods. More recent data is not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dlb6g"&gt;Health department spokesperson Chantal Gomez said the agency aims to inspect all towers once a year, but 40% of all the city’s towers — including within the five affected ZIP codes — have not been inspected since 2023. Gomez said staffing shortages are to blame for the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="73qtc"&gt;“We take a risk-based approach when prioritizing inspections — including based on compliance history,” Gomez wrote in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9hmu3"&gt;Juan Genao, a building operations associate who helps oversee water testing for LaGuardia Community College, said city inspections are critical for making sure cooling towers are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="blpsu"&gt;“We’re talking about the health and safety of people,” he said. “If you don’t have the city overseeing them, it’s very easy for people to cut corners, and all of a sudden you have an outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7savi"&gt;William Fowler, a spokesperson for the Adams administration, told Gothamist that the health department has the staff it needs to &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/public-health-experts-concerned-over-drop-in-legionella-inspections-under-adams" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;address the current outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="fmrqi"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What have building owners been doing to comply with the law and ensure safety?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="epsbs"&gt;City inspections are just one part of the city’s regulatory framework. Regular testing conducted by building owners is the first line of defense. The &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015 law&lt;/a&gt; requires owners to test their cooling towers weekly for all bacterial growth and every three months for Legionella bacteria. Owners have to report their Legionella test results to the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3sdiu"&gt;Our analysis found that slightly more building owners in the five ZIP codes were in good standing when compared to the rest of the city. About 75% of towers in the affected areas have up-to-date reporting on their Legionella testing as of early August. Whereas the citywide average is 73%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="84sou"&gt;Slightly more than half of the towers in the five ZIP codes that are in good standing have not been inspected by the city since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="gbjf"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about the towers that were behind on testing? Were they inspected?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c2s54"&gt;It’s unclear whether a building that fails to report Legionella test results is more likely to be flagged by the health department for inspection. The agency did not answer questions about whether prioritizing these cooling towers is part of its risk-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fbts2"&gt;While 75% of towers in the five outbreak ZIP codes were up-to-date on their testing, 17 had no reported test results at all. The health department said some of those towers could be inactive and would therefore not be required to test. But the agency would not confirm which towers were no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d6ral"&gt;To get around this limitation, Gothamist identified cooling towers that did have test results at some point in the past year, but not in the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="diugp"&gt;By that definition, 5% of the towers in the affected ZIP codes that were behind on their reported test results had also not been inspected by the city since 2023 — a total of five towers. That figure is slightly higher than a citywide average of 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxORkRWdWtqV1I4blJXUmk5ZU9zUWJnMkx6d2pvLWIwTmdsMFdCZUlSNnZVWGkyTkJ6c19Wd3VWdUV2RjBZdlliY1I2OGoxaWk2eEVmWDlnM2UyNkx0WFJNZktKaUV2dVdnZlo5QVdweXVSUnpXT1UtNDc2bVBpejhDS1k4UGtnQUF6dmw5el9ndVd5WWF2NWh2VngwRE1sOVBfRDEyaUhfUVJuQQ</guid></item><item><title>在科罗拉多州，有“角”的兔子被称为“弗兰肯斯坦兔子”。'原因如下- Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQMmRTeXhqSDVkaUFtTTAyX0N1RklWOTlCZkRwdVBrV3FuOUo5Wm9ab2NhRkNmTmI5NnZqVmcxTDZjS0NVNFc2VmJmZ2VNZ1QxTGFLbVVaMlFTeUlIYi1PdTRRUEwza2lkb1o4TmJIY2ZKSXM0T0pxbWg2dnZmVHhNbktLN3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked—the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including "Frankenstein bunnies," "demon rabbits" and "zombie rabbits." But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+papillomavirus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; that causes &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cervical+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rabbit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

When healthy mice were fed a lithium-reduced diet, scientists found they aged more rapidly, and experienced brain inflammation and &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, scientists observed that lower lithium levels sped up the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and activated inflammatory cells called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7577179/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, when mice were provided with a lithium compound called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8413749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;lithium orotate&lt;/a&gt;, Alzheimer’s disease-related damage to the brain was reversed and memory function was restored. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer’s disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,” &lt;a href="https://www.hms.harvard.edu/agingresearch/index.php/yankner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Bruce Yankner&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School and senior author of this study, said in a &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial,” Yankner cautioned, though he emphasized that “so far the results are very encouraging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.12500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;anti-amyloid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10965012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;anti-tau therapies&lt;/a&gt;, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients’ lives,” the study author said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/manisha-santosh-parulekar/1319173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Manisha Parulekar&lt;/a&gt;, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that this discovery is significant because it offers a new way of looking at Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years, the fight against Alzheimer’s has been dominated by a single-target approach, focusing almost exclusively on clearing amyloid plaques,” Parulekar, who was not involved in this study, explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But as dementia specialists, we know this is a multifaceted disease that affects the entire ecosystem of the brain. This study suggests a depletion of a natural element, and how restoring that balance could potentially impact all the major hallmarks of the disease — the plaques, the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh4731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;tangles&lt;/a&gt;, and cognitive function itself,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parulekar said that these findings could potentially lead to new ways to both treat and detect Alzheimer’s disease, but in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like starting a healthy diet and exercise plan. If you start early, it can prevent heart disease. But even if you’ve already had a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151444" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, starting that same healthy plan can still help you. It won’t undo the past damage, but it will make your body stronger and help slow down future problems. Similarly, lithium seems to make the brain healthier and more resilient. So, it could be used as a treatment to protect the brain cells that are still healthy and slow down the progression of the disease in people who already have it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke to &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/g.-peter-gliebus/2730213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Peter Gliebus&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a neurologist, and director of cognitive and behavioral neurology at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, a part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gliebus, who was not involved in the recent study, said his first reaction to its findings is one of cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings indicate that lithium exhibits a substantial impact on brain health and may mitigate the early molecular alterations associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study underscores the potential of lithium replacement therapy as a preventive or therapeutic intervention. This discovery holds a promise as it presents novel avenues for addressing the disease at its earliest stages, potentially slowing or even halting its progression,” Gliebus explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These findings have the potential to contribute to the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in the future,” he continued. The study shows lithium deficiency as an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, potentially serving as a biomarker for early detection. Measuring lithium levels in the brain could enable the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing the disease.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, the therapeutic application of lithium orotate, which circumvents plaque sequestration, demonstrates promise in reversing or preventing pathological alterations in animal models,” Gliebus added. “If these findings are validated in human studies, lithium replacement therapy could emerge as a viable treatment option, particularly for individuals experiencing early cognitive decline or at elevated risk for Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPNkhxTUtXYl9TZ2l0QVRmSG0tWUxTdU5ISW04dDY4N1pDeFZydXdGbWJLdk5EZGpra29JbzNoUEJyRWVGcjV3MFFYUVBvS20tZEJvVG10UWhoSmZXYW5CcEVZM0wzMUxIb3Z3N0pHdEhQVEhadk0yalJ2T2lUeGpVTjhrT0l1RW1OZUtlRG0xRFNVTTFPLXFmZHp3bXN5bVI5OFliRA</guid></item><item><title>在科罗拉多州，有“角”的兔子被称为“弗兰肯斯坦兔子”。’原因如下-美联社新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZzRWcjctUkJSMnFzalZUOGN2ZHI3LTVjYmtyVWg3WDZCd1ZlcDEzOXZjRkROdWMtcktaSl9NN21OYjhOeDNneEN4UlU2UmROaG9lWVYwZnZjWG4zLWJzTlloSnI4Q0VERXFaYy0tQVZVSGxNUlNCUUZtTF9IYXVUeUxod3pPOHg4TG9FblVfczljM3J1MHFLQmVwaGNDSmlZUS1KWlpZcmRzdGJMU2lBbkpFazN3Snhid3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 02:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZzRWcjctUkJSMnFzalZUOGN2ZHI3LTVjYmtyVWg3WDZCd1ZlcDEzOXZjRkROdWMtcktaSl9NN21OYjhOeDNneEN4UlU2UmROaG9lWVYwZnZjWG4zLWJzTlloSnI4Q0VERXFaYy0tQVZVSGxNUlNCUUZtTF9IYXVUeUxod3pPOHg4TG9FblVfczljM3J1MHFLQmVwaGNDSmlZUS1KWlpZcmRzdGJMU2lBbkpFazN3Snhid3c</guid></item><item><title>1800万美国人遵循的肮脏习惯与惊人的精神分裂症激增有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcGFrZHdrZS1Lb0V5WUhkX3JJQkk3eExQalhsNUthTEV4UHFicFVkamVtamNESmZkX2J1aU9HeERvdm9GSVRvVmVBZ2JIS0w1OUtCdHVZdmxFYjRtOEhfS2tfSEl5UGVfdjBhNk1WX0c0YXhSLWVkdG9waW42LWhnTWF1MzRZNVFxZnNnRTFqZlhWMUN6NUkwaUh3Njd1Vy1Xajh0ODFGdDYxS1VG0gGyAUFVX3lxTE95LWdtQ0tPa3BnR1FpRWhYcWJ1d0RSNFJqb3pNWVU3SERfdXV0dXcyNVpSVUUzX1Fya0IyTm1wcTBFWnZhUWpSajJGZHFyQnBrV2FwUWhEX1hOeGlNVUg2aTZLSTk1Z1dkYXkweUxzTWhSNG1HOTlhV2VBY3MyLUhJWmYyd2l4U0YtMllyWjhVUEtTRXFfX0JCQmFpcWZaaWdBUzUwM0toUkpVUnlFVGRGbmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 18 million Americans who use cannabis daily have drastically increased their odds of developing schizophrenia, a serious mental disorder that can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The grim findings come from a new report by the Canadian Medical Association Journal which revealed that patients needing hospitalization because of cannabis-related health problems were 14 times more likely to develop schizophrenia within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms could range from severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13482157/People-ancient-viruses-DNA-prone-depression-study-reveals.html"&gt;psychiatric symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as paranoia or panic attacks to overdosing on THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis that gives users its signature 'high' feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that the risk for schizophrenia was a staggering 241 times higher among people needing hospitalization for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14826281/watching-pornography-shockingly-linked-DEMENTIA.html"&gt;cannabis-induced psychosis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This temporary mental health condition triggered by cannabis use causes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14189575/I-possessed-demon-decades-violently-exorcised.html"&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;, delusions, and disorganized thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report found that the main cause of this major health risk was the significant rise in the levels of THC within cannabis, which has gone from just four percent 20 years ago to 20 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa said: 'Cannabis from the 2000s is not the same as in 2025.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While schizophrenia itself is not a fatal condition, it can lead to life-threatening situations as these patients have a higher risk of dying by suicide due to severe symptoms such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new report have found a concerning link between cannabis use and the development of mental health disorders (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regular cannabis users hospitalized for THC exposure were 14 times more likely to develop schizophrenia within 3 years (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/27/E810"&gt;new report from CMAJ&lt;/a&gt; pooled the results from five separate studies on cannabis use in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These studies included data gathered from a large population-based study in Ontario involving 9.8 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That specific dataset helped researchers find the growing connection between cannabis-induced health issues and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study authors warned that the higher potency of cannabis today showed a direct link to psychosis risk, especially among younger users, men, and those with a history of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the report revealed that about 0.47 percent of cannabis users end up experiencing symptoms of psychosis. That's roughly one in every 200 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, up to 76 percent of those who do experience these symptoms for more than 24 hours end up needing emergency care - sending their chances of developing schizophrenia skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schizophrenia is treated with a combination of antipsychotic medications, therapy, and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antipsychotic drugs, like risperidone and olanzapine can help manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions by balancing brain chemicals. Therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help patients cope with symptoms and improve their daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 18 millions Americans report using cannabis products on a daily basis (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for regular cannabis users who haven't developed mental health problems, study authors said there is one definitive way to reduce their risk: stop using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, the report warned that continuing to use cannabis after an initial episode of psychosis led to an increased risk that the symptoms would return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using cannabis, especially high-potency products with more than 20 percent THC, can cause some people to experience severe nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rapid heart rate, chest pains that mimic a heart attack, or fainting can also occur and require an urgent trip to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdosing on THC, particularly from consuming edibles or using vapes, can lead to extreme confusion, agitation, or a loss of coordination, all of which can increase the risk of a serious accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among users with pre-existing mental health conditions, cannabis-related health problems can include worsening symptoms of anxiety or depression, such as severe mood swings or suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cannabis’ status in the US has been complex for years, with recreational use legal in 24 states and Washington DC, and medical use allowed in 38 states as of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it remains a Schedule I drug federally, classified as highly dangerous with no accepted medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden administration proposed moving cannabis to Schedule III in May 2024, recognizing its potential as a medical treatment, but a January 2025 hearing was canceled, leaving the decision to the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:42:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcGFrZHdrZS1Lb0V5WUhkX3JJQkk3eExQalhsNUthTEV4UHFicFVkamVtamNESmZkX2J1aU9HeERvdm9GSVRvVmVBZ2JIS0w1OUtCdHVZdmxFYjRtOEhfS2tfSEl5UGVfdjBhNk1WX0c0YXhSLWVkdG9waW42LWhnTWF1MzRZNVFxZnNnRTFqZlhWMUN6NUkwaUh3Njd1Vy1Xajh0ODFGdDYxS1VG0gGyAUFVX3lxTE95LWdtQ0tPa3BnR1FpRWhYcWJ1d0RSNFJqb3pNWVU3SERfdXV0dXcyNVpSVUUzX1Fya0IyTm1wcTBFWnZhUWpSajJGZHFyQnBrV2FwUWhEX1hOeGlNVUg2aTZLSTk1Z1dkYXkweUxzTWhSNG1HOTlhV2VBY3MyLUhJWmYyd2l4U0YtMllyWjhVUEtTRXFfX0JCQmFpcWZaaWdBUzUwM0toUkpVUnlFVGRGbmc</guid></item><item><title>官员：鳕鱼角游泳运动员感染了可能导致“食肉”疾病的罕见细菌- Boston.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOeFloOHFVekwxVzdzMDhseWZxMFhfYzZiS0hOSi1DdUtZLU1ZeXdwNXFEajNRYzVKR283WmRyaG0yVGNPTTdvbTdsc3kzR05vbmtQdWhlZHAtR1Bya2VXbTlVbXdrWU9CaVI3UjdMZTRBUi04eHQ2c3hDaEhkdEhIRU5DVHpDYV9TMHk3WWFaNnFGbG1Qazl3WjhvU1pFaGh4R1ZvQjhDY2xwTDVocmJrZnczekdYcVBiQ1RyUmVWay1lN3g0d0lQQnZ6ZS1ITWRSd1ZQS3p3Rl_SAeABQVVfeXFMTUY3dUJxNldPQkpQbHBHaGR3SDdra0lVUEVSdzFEYzJhMXk5WU8tdGRpNVFSZXdkQnRHVy1RSm03ZjBYSGc5WXliUXBJUEt5cF8wYmlFWHBwTlVOYlk3bkVUT2ZsRzlKREVxTEJSWXhCYkdJYnFsVkg2elhraTFxWVRoNVpSWXdibWk2WnNnT05xWDlpUTNUSDQ4U2hGUFVJX3czaDd0OWxxNGNxOEptUGdPRTZEMkdMM3kzTEpMYXl3OXZVZFZveWJaX0FheGZzZ2c1LXlGZmZscHp5cWpEdUY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="content-well content-well--article" role="main"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts public health officials issued a warning Wednesday about the presence of a rare and potentially dangerous bacteria in the state’s coastal waters after a swimmer contracted an uncommon infection on &lt;a href="http://Boston.com/tag/cape-cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vibrio vulnificus infection, from Vibrio bacteria, was identified last week in an “older individual” who went swimming with an exposed wound at Old Silver Beach in Falmouth, Falmouth and Barnstable County health officials &lt;a href="https://www.falmouthma.gov/1579/Vibrio-vulnificus"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Silver Beach remains open, the Cape officials said, noting that the infections from the bacteria remain “extremely uncommon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cape Cod’s beaches are an important part of our economy, culture, and community,” Scott McGann, health agent for the Town of Falmouth, said in a statement. “By taking a few simple precautions, residents and visitors, and particularly anyone who is vulnerable or immunocompromised, can continue to enjoy them safely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to monitor bathing water for Vibrio bacteria, according to Falmouth officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;state health officials&lt;/a&gt;, there have been seven confirmed cases of Vibrio vulnificus in Massachusetts in the last several years, including four who were likely exposed in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from the bacteria are more common in warmer waters along the Gulf Coast, according to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, most infections from Vibrio bacteria result from people consuming shellfish containing the bacteria, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone exposed to the bacteria can get an infection, but immunocompromised people or those with a chronic illness, young children, and pregnant people are at greater risk from developing severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vibrio bacteria normally live in warm, salt or brackish waters along the Atlantic coast,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “Heat waves and above-average water surface temperatures create favorable conditions for Vibrio bacteria to grow, making May through October generally the peak season for these bacteria. People with open wounds who spend time in the water, or those who consume contaminated shellfish, can develop an infection when the bacteria enter the body. Sometimes these infections can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe, even life-threatening illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Vibrio infections can lead to the “flesh-eating” disease called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/about/necrotizing-fasciitis.html"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which results in the death of the flesh around the infected wound, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms of a Vibrio infection include fever, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have an open wound that has been exposed to warm, coastal waters are advised to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection for seven days and are advised to seek medical attention if they develop fever, chills, dangerously low blood pressure, blistering skin lesions or any redness, pain, swelling, warmth, discoloration, or discharge at the site of the wound,” state health officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent wound infections from Vibrio bacteria, health officials advise staying out of coastal waters or using a waterproof bandage over any open wounds. People with open wounds should also avoid handling raw seafood, and any wounds should be washed with soap and water after coming into contact with coastal water or raw shellfish, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re really seriously considering not doing COVID vaccines this year,” said Laura Kittross, public health program manager for the Berkshire Regional Planning Commission, which coordinates with 18 Western Massachusetts municipalities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy’s open skepticism of vaccines and his recent decisions that include changing guidelines on who should get COVID vaccines have state officials and public health professionals questioning whether they can continue to rely on what used to be a smooth-running system. In response, Massachusetts officials are exploring creating an alternate vaccine policy, which could include an unprecedented collaboration with neighboring states to replicate some of the work federal health agencies&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;typically perform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“At this moment we can’t always look to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for the guidance we received previously,” Dr. Robbie Goldstein, the state’s commissioner of the Department of Public Health, said during a DPH-hosted panel Wednesday that focused on vaccination. “This is a little bit of building the plane while we fly it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discussion was eagerly awaited by health providers throughout Massachusetts who say keeping up with vaccine recommendations is difficult enough without conflicting messages from Washington. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Pediatricians are overwhelmed and really looking for guidance,” said Dr. Everett Lamm, cochair of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Immunization Initiative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Typically, a CDC advisory panel every June&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommends vaccines for seasonal spikes in flu, RSV, and, more recently, COVID. Under Kennedy, that process has been haphazard. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/"&gt;he fired&lt;/a&gt; every member of the committee, and replaced them with a smaller group who generally have less experience with vaccines but share some of his political positions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;An HHS spokesperson said Kennedy considered the previous version of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, as a rubber stamp that failed to critically evaluate scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints on ACIP,” the HHS statement said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The spokesperson did not reply to questions about the delayed COVID shot recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The new ACIP committee members recommended &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; that thimerosal, a preservative, be eliminated from all vaccines. The mercury-containing compound is used in just 4 percent of flu doses in the United States but has long been associated, falsely, with autism. The panel’s decision to give credence to a debunked conspiracy theory alarmed health experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think the level of trust for information coming out of the CDC right now is somewhere between negative one and zero,” said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota vaccine expert who participated in the forum Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For local authorities such as Kittross, the delay hinders efforts to protect people in one of the state’s least vaccinated regions. By this time last year, groups such as the regional planning commission would have begun ordering roughly 2,000 COVID vaccine doses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While Berkshire County’s lower inoculation rates are in part due to a streak of vaccine hesitancy, Kittross said, it is also a consequence of limited access to medical care in a rural area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think it’s really difficult for people here,” she said. “You don’t walk past a CVS on your way to work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It isn’t too late to order COVID vaccine, she said, but the clock is ticking, and at roughly $120 a dose, it’s a cost local health departments cannot afford to foot without a guarantee insurers will reimburse them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many of the state’s 351 local public health agencies face the same uncertainty, said Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Alliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Many are&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;not&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;making decisions about ordering vaccines until they know there will be insurance coverage,” she said. “If there isn’t, they will be unable to order.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hospitals, too, are waiting to learn whether their workers will be required to get COVID shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s time to preorder COVID vaccines, and we don’t even know who will qualify for COVID vaccines in the fall,” said Dr. Shira Doron, hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The website for the CDC advisory panel notes a meeting is expected to be held in August or September. If it does end up recommending COVID vaccines, providers would have time to obtain doses for the coming winter, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The confusion and changing guidance from the federal government prompted Governor Maura Healey to &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf"&gt;propose legislation&lt;/a&gt; in July to give the state more leeway in determining which vaccines are covered by its&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Vaccine Purchase Trust Fund, which funds free inoculations for children. Right now, the fund can support only vaccines recommended by the CDC panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts is in discussions with Connecticut, Maine, New York, and Rhode Island to coordinate vaccine recommendations without input from the CDC panel, public health officials said. While in the planning stages, states would likely rely on advice from national professional societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease Society of America, to provide coordinated guidance to public health and medical providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, an initiative run by Osterholm of the University of Minnesota called the Vaccine Integrity Project is gathering reams of information on vaccines to help professional societies make recommendations. He acknowledged it will not be able to replicate in total the work of the CDC advisory committee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That was a pretty seamless system in terms of assessment,” &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Osterholm said. “I would just say that it’s our loss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other health experts said it is important participating states coordinate recommendations, both to bolster public trust and increase the likelihood insurers will cover vaccines without federal approval. Each state giving its own vaccine recommendations would cause chaos, experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s OK for us to tweak the language a little bit but it’s not OK for each of us to have a different recommendation,” Goldstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It is unclear, though, if insurers, which are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC panel, would do the same for those  suggested  by regional public health collaboratives. In a statement, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Massachusetts’ largest private insurer, said it did not rely exclusively on CDC recommendations to determine what vaccines it would cover. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We strongly support vaccine access and view it as a critical part of public health and preventive care,” Blue Cross said in the statement. “When deciding what vaccinations to cover, we examine the published evidence as well as national guidelines from expert bodies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein said other insurers have been open to relying on vaccine authorities other than the federal government. It saves insurers money to prevent costly illnesses in their customers, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;MassHealth, the state-run Medicaid program, said in a statement that it is able to cover vaccines not recommended by the CDC panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy has in many ways reshaped the federal public health apparatus to reflect his skeptical, and in some cases unproven views on vaccine safety and efficacy. The CDC lifted COVID vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women and this month Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/nation/mrna-vaccine-rfk-jr-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/nation/mrna-vaccine-rfk-jr-what-to-know/"&gt;canceled $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in federal funding for research to create new mRNA vaccines. MRNA vaccines protected millions of people during COVID and can be produced quickly, making them a potentially lifesaving resource during another pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet even if Massachusetts can establish a vaccine policy independent of Washington, the fracturing of what used to be a consensus among public health authorities could worsen the country’s already significant undercurrent of vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think we’re already seeing that it’s impacting vaccination rates,” Goldstein said. “National rhetoric has increased vaccine hesitancy on all types of vaccines.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

				&lt;p&gt;The risk for West Nile virus is now considered “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities, state public health officials warned Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;opi=89978449&amp;amp;url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-health&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAspK-_4iPAxWVFFkFHQ6RIWcQFnoECCAQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1Nt9w5EPciyZ4g-9AUvB"&gt;Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; said the level of West Nile virus is now considered high in Acton, Bedford, Billerica, Boston, Brookline, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Dracut, Lowell, and Newton, based on mosquito samples taken from those communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes of the year were confirmed on June 17, and since then 168 samples have been detected across Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester counties, DPH said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[West Nile virus] findings in mosquitoes have accelerated rapidly over the last several weeks,” State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “We are now in the peak time for transmission of mosquito-borne disease to people and it is important for people to know that so they can take steps to protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no human cases of West Nile yet this year, but a goat in Lunenburg was diagnosed with the illness. Nineteen people in the state contracted the illness last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t experience symptoms, but some can develop headaches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and body aches. Most recover on their own without medical assistance, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/west-nile-virus-risk-level-boston-raised-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to Boston health officials&lt;/a&gt;. But, people who are over the age of 50 or immunocompromised are at risk of developing severe illness from West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased risk level for West Nile virus in Boston is a reminder that protecting yourself and your families from mosquito bites is important,” Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s Commissioner of Public Health, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/west-nile-virus-risk-level-boston-raised-high"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Residents should take precautions like using mosquito repellent and avoiding outdoor activities from dusk to dawn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus isn’t the only mosquito-borne illness public health officials are urging residents to protect against. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/23/mosquitos-in-central-mass-town-test-positive-for-eee/"&gt;also been detected&lt;/a&gt; in mosquitoes in the state this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials said Belchertown, Bridgewater, Carver, East Bridgewater, Easton, Granby, Halifax, Hanson, Lakeville, Middleborough, Pelham, Plympton, Raynham, Taunton, Ware, and West Bridgewater are considered at moderate risk for EEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no confirmed human cases of EEE so far this year. In 2024, there were four human cases, with one fatality, and three animal cases of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both West Nile virus and EEE pose risk to the people in Massachusetts,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “The weather remains warm and somewhat humid, which increases mosquito activity. I encourage everyone to take measures to protect themselves: use mosquito repellent when outdoors, wear long sleeves and pants, and be aware of peak mosquito hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to using insect repellent and avoiding peak mosquito biting hours (dusk to dawn), officials are urging residents to take steps to protect their homes and animals by draining standing water and installing or repairing screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents can check the state’s map that &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"&gt;tracks the risk&lt;/a&gt; for mosquito-borne illnesses in Massachusetts to determine the risk for EEE and West Nile virus in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Franklin
County officials reported its 10th  confirmed animal rabies case of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On
Wednesday, staff with Franklin County Animal Services said they have been
working to make sure infected animals are managed safely, and that the
community is aware of positive cases in the area. Officials said they work
closely with Franklin County Health Department to make sure rules for
quarantining and isolation of animals are being closely followed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve
already doubled the number of confirmed rabies cases in Franklin County this
year, more than all of 2024, and this season is not even close to being over,”
said Scott LaVigne, Franklin County Health Director.   &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Six
of the 10 cases involved skunks, which has been consistent with previous years. Officials said this year has also
included two raccoons, one fox and a bat. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone
that comes into contact with an infected animal or believes they have been
exposed should seek medical attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies
is nearly 100% fatal in humans once you show symptoms of infection, so we
strictly follow the guidelines,” LaVigne said. “Today, a series of four to five shots is
sufficient to prevent rabies in people.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Pet
owners should also protect their furry loved ones by making sure they are up to
date with their rabies vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“In
nearly every rabies case this year, where domestic animals were exposed, some
pets had never had a rabies shot,” said Jerry Jones, Interim Animal Services
Manager. “That’s a conversation no one wants to have with a family.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials
offered tips to best limit pet’s exposure to rabies:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate your pets against rabies and keep the vaccinations current.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep pets inside. Supervise pets outside and keep dogs on a leash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed pets outside. Pet food and mulch attract wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed wildlife, feral cats, or feral dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure garbage cans with wildlife-proof lids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News has a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/avoid-strange-animals-and-other-tips-to-minimize-rabies-risk/17685299/"&gt;guide online&lt;/a&gt; with tips to minimize the risk of rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials
advise calling 911 to contact Animal Services if they see any animal showing
rabies symptoms. People should keep a safe distance away from the animal but
watch out for where the animal is until Animal Services Officers arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Dogs
and cats are required to have an updated rabies vaccination. If a pet is not
vaccinated or is due for a vaccine, pet owners are advised to contact their
veterinarian. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Franklin
County Animal Shelter is also offering a vaccine event on Saturday, August 23,
from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. The cost for a rabies vaccine is $15. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;For
livestock and other pets, owners should contact their veterinarian for rabies
vaccination information and prevention. &lt;/p&gt;

From 2015 to 2024, there was an average of 88 cases of the various Vibrio infections per year in Massachusetts, according to the state department of public health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There were 62 cases in 2020, and 127 in 2024, the department said. Most of the infections arose from consuming contaminated shellfish, state health officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Symptoms range from fever, to redness, pain, swelling and warmth in the wound area, as well as discoloration and discharge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Although &lt;i&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; infections are most common in the warm waters of the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Florida, rising water temperatures are contributing to more cases arising further north, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-florida/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-florida/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; recently reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This year, there have been 17 cases in Louisiana, 16 in Florida, and seven in North Carolina.
