After all, it often brings to mind greasy takeout, salty snacks or sugary treats. But here’s the truth: convenience doesn’t always mean unhealthy. In fact, supporting your heart health doesn’t require hours in the kitchen—many quick and easy foods can be part of a heart-healthy diet. “Convenience foods get a bad rap, but we often underestimate how many options actually fall into this category beyond chips or doughnut holes,” says &lt;a href="https://www.artofappetite.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bree Phillips, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bree Phillips, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is choosing foods rich in nutrients that support healthy blood pressure—like fiber, potassium and magnesium—while &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:limiting sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;limiting sodium&lt;/a&gt;, which can increase blood pressure. The good news? Grocery stores are full of simple, convenient, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872995/complete-list-of-heart-healthy-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy options;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart-healthy options&lt;/a&gt;. Here are six dietitian-approved convenience foods to add to your list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Canned Black Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A great convenience food for better blood pressure is canned no-salt-added black beans,” says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re quick and ready to use, packed with potassium and magnesium—two minerals that help relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. They’re also high in fiber, which supports heart health.” If you can’t find a sodium-free version, she recommends giving them a rinse before eating to reduce any excess sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re short on time, having these in your pantry means you can have a nourishing meal in just minutes. Try tossing them into a salad for a satisfying lunch, mashing them with spices for a quick bean dip, or adding them to soups and tacos for an easy dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Steamed &amp;amp; Peeled Beets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beets are nutritional powerhouses, but preparing them from scratch can be a messy and time-consuming process. That’s why canned beets are an excellent choice. “This convenient option lets you enjoy all the benefits without any of the purple-stained fingers, making it simple to add a vibrant, earthy and healthy component to any meal. They’re such a time-saver and spare the mess of preparing fresh beets,” says &lt;a href="https://www.rachellemallik.com/meetrachelle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rachelle Mallik, M.A., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rachelle Mallik, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.christinaychu.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christina Chu, M.S., RD, CSSD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christina Chu, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports dietitian, points to their added nutritional benefits. “Beets contain nitrates, which convert to nitric oxide, a natural vasodilator that opens up your blood vessels, thus improving blood flow and improving blood pressure,” she explains. Steamed beets are also a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/11369/healthy-recipes-for-potassium-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good source of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good source of potassium&lt;/a&gt; and folate, both of which contribute to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can slice them into a salad with goat cheese and walnuts, blend them into a smoothie for a nutrient boost, or simply enjoy them as a side dish drizzled with a little balsamic glaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Canned Tuna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Canned tuna with no salt added can be a great choice for someone looking to regulate their blood pressure,” shares &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Not only is it low in sodium, but it is a lean source of protein and high in omega-3s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Omega-3 fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; are celebrated for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:support overall heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;support overall heart health&lt;/a&gt;, including managing healthy blood pressure. Studies suggest that they help blood vessels relax and improve how they function, which reduces strain on the heart and arteries. Tuna also contains selenium, a trace mineral linked with better blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try adding canned tuna on top of a salad, in a sandwich or in a delicious pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Frozen Cooked Edamame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found in the freezer aisle, edamame is one of the most underrated convenience foods. These green soybeans are “loaded with plant protein, potassium, isoflavones (plant compounds) and fiber; all components that support healthy blood pressure levels,” explains &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com/contact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, studies have found that eating soybeans and soy products is associated with lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a bag in your freezer and steam them for a simple side dish, toss them into stir-fries or salads for extra protein, or puree them with garlic and lemon juice to make a nutritious dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Plain Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping a container of plain strained (Greek-style) yogurt in your fridge is a convenient way to boost nutrition at any meal. It’s thicker and higher in protein than regular yogurt, providing a satisfying base for countless creations. It’s also linked with better blood pressure, thanks to its quality protein and nutrients like potassium, magnesium and calcium that help support healthy blood vessels and flush out excess sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high protein content can also aid in weight management, which is another key factor in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:maintaining healthy blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;maintaining healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use it as a base for a heart-healthy parfait with berries and nuts, as a healthier substitute for sour cream on baked potatoes, or as a creamy foundation for sauces and dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Prewashed Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating more vegetables rich in natural nitrates, like leafy greens, is linked to lower blood pressure. They’re also rich in potassium, magnesium and an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:array of antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;array of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; like lutein that support heart health. In fact, one study found that a greater intake of leafy greens is associated with lower blood pressure and a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduced risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While salad kits can sometimes come with high-sodium dressings, a simple bag of prewashed spinach, kale or arugula offers pure convenience. These greens are ready to use right out of the bag, cutting down on prep time and making it incredibly easy to add to any meal. Use these greens in salads, soups, sauces, smoothies or sandwiches to easily boost your nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting a diet that supports healthy blood pressure doesn’t have to mean an expensive grocery list or a complicated meal plan. Simple changes and smart choices can make a big difference. By including &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-and-ultra-processed-foods-dietitian-approved-11770154" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrient-rich convenience foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;nutrient-rich convenience foods&lt;/a&gt; like the ones on this list, you can build &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart-healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; without adding stress to your busy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that you don’t have to buy everything at once or completely overhaul your diet. Start by adding one or two items to your weekly routine—swap a salty snack for edamame, or replace a complicated side dish with some steamed beets. Small, easy adjustments like these let you take control of your health one delicious meal at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-convenience-foods-to-lower-blood-pressure-11801985" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 14:19:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBjRjdpUE9kd0hyTmJ5TkpIZ0wxekV4dE9UWXQ5VUJQMGpOUnZ1X1c1Z0ZPTEdRNXl2T29kdmFCNDI4WmVYb0doVTI4MzlIU0k2U09LSkV1R2xKZXA2QU9vUW9odmVIRGEzbjJ4MVV5d2pVdw</guid></item><item><title>小金毛小狗造型牛仔帽和靴子偷人心- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/tiny-golden-retriever-puppy-modeling-202000931.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pups were born to be stars, and others just naturally know how to work an outfit.

And in severe cases, they need to be on a ventilator,” Patel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-shots-fda-approved-limits_l_68a74310e4b0cfb9a82aa596" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Children 6 months and older" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bb3c15e4b0a78951966045" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68a74310e4b0cfb9a82aa596" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Children 6 months and older&lt;/a&gt; with an underlying condition are eligible for the Moderna vaccine, but not the Pfizer of Novavax versions.

Long COVID can persist for weeks or years after a COVID infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And when you look at the complications for children with underlying health conditions and elderly individuals, there are also risk of &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/2022/06/preventing-life-threatening-blood-clots-in-children-with-serious-cases-of-covid-19" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="clotting disorders" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bb3c15e4b0a78951966045" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/2022/06/preventing-life-threatening-blood-clots-in-children-with-serious-cases-of-covid-19" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;clotting disorders&lt;/a&gt; and strokes,” Patel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination can help prevent long COVID and long-term effects of an infection, Patel noted. “So my major concern is that, because of this confusion, patients are just going to opt out of getting the COVID vaccine, because if physicians and pharmacies are confused as to who is eligible to get it, you can bet that the lay people are even more confused. That confusion is going to lead to an increase in vaccine hesitancy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting the shot could mean someone ends up with long COVID after infection or another severe consequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There could be a big disparity in who actually has access to the vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you may need a prescription from a doctor for vaccine access in some states. This creates a big health disparity, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eric2687/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Eric

brings up the point where not everyone in this country has access to a primary care doctor where they can just go get a prescription and go to CVS or go to their doctor to get vaccinated at the office,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have so many people who just don’t have primary care doctors, who are underinsured or uninsured and can’t have access to these things,” Burnett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a divide in who has access to the vaccines, Burnett explained, which is worrisome and could cause worse health outcomes in groups that are already underinsured or uninsured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we enter cold and flu season, hospitals could deal with overcrowding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re entering cold and flu season, and our hospitals are already very, very busy,” Burnett said. “Just last month in August, hospitals were overflowing with patients, and that’s concerning because August is typically the season where we don’t have much activity in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnett is worried that hospitals will be even busier during respiratory virus season as vaccine access is fragmented and there’s much confusion about who can actually get the COVID shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m already starting to see more and more ER visits,” Burnett said. “I haven’t seen too much COVID, I’m starting to see more of it now, but it’s just busy in general, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there’s so much impact from the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people got sick during COVID, a lot of which resulted in a lot of chronic illness, not just from COVID itself, but just from people having interruption in their health care,” Burnett continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Many people were afraid to leave their homes to go to doctors’ appointments during the pandemic, which allowed symptoms to worsen and left underlying conditions untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t realize that we’re still dealing with the ramifications of the pandemic and how it disrupted health care,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t at risk of severe COVID or flu, you may need to go to the hospital for another reason, such as a broken leg or a bad cut, and you might be met with long wait times because of the crowding at the hospital, Burnett explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

Jacintha, a horseback rider, was familiar with &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/30/elon-musk-ketamine-trump-campaign/83942817007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ketamine&lt;/a&gt; as a horse tranquilizer but had never heard of it as a last-stop mental health treatment for treatment-resistant patients like Lucy, who was diagnosed with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There was only one thing: Most ketamine users are in their 30s or older. Lucy was just 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When people are desperate, you're ready to take desperate measures,” says Jacintha, who asked that we withhold her last name to protect her daughter's medical privacy. “I think any parent who sees their child struggling as hard as Lucy was struggling would want to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/02/12/what-is-ketamine/72499723007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Ketamine therapy&lt;/a&gt; has been gaining popularity in recent years and, in select cases, has been used to treat young people. Doctors say it can provide life-saving support in instances where other medications have failed, but there are risks involved, including the potential for dependence when improperly administered. Despite the potential dangers, some young users and their families say trying the controversial therapy is preferable to being stuck in the status quo.Dozens of commenters on Reddit talk about seeking out care for minors, but most USA TODAY spoke with declined to go on the record for fear of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The detrimental effect on the brain of growing up with severe treatment-resistant depression is far worse than the whatever risk that we associate with the very sporadic dosing of these low doses of ketamine,” says Chair of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine John Krystal. However, he adds there’s little research about ketamine therapy’s effect on young adults, and as such, it should be a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How ketamine therapy works in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A few months after that Google search, Jacintha and Lucy walked into the Northwest Ketamine Clinic’s Bellevue, Washington, outpost, where Lucy began the first of 12 ketamine infusion sessions, all administered in April and May of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The doctors had explained how the ketamine infusion would work: The chemical would bind to receptors in the brain, interfering with the connection between the brain and the body, leading to a disconnected, out-of-body feeling where Lucy might experience detachment from reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That first session, Jacintha held Lucy’s hand, cautiously optimistic. Things got worse before they got better, and Lucy experienced mood swings and random spurts of anger. But after the seventh session, it was like something “just completely shifted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The therapy helped her manage her self-harm and contamination-triggered OCD. Before ketamine therapy, hearing someone cough or breathe loudly in the classroom would send her into panic mode, ultimately causing her to drop out of school. At home, she didn’t enter the downstairs kitchen at all, feeling too overwhelmed by the fridge, dirty dishes, and smells from cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After the infusions, “I was feeling way better than ever before,” Lucy says. “It really did shift my mood a lot. I was just generally at a higher level of functioning every day; I wasn't depressed all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A representative for Northwest Ketamine Clinic says their clinics don’t treat anyone under the age of 14, but they've seen a rise in interest from parents looking to treat teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ketamine works by stimulating the brain’s resilience mechanisms, according to Krystal. The chemical targets a different system in the brain than standard antidepressants, triggering the release of glutamate, which stimulates the growth of new synapses between brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The plasticity of the brain ‒ the ability to learn, adapt, respond ‒ becomes compromised by depression,” Krystal says. “Even a single dose of ketamine can have a positive effect on this kind of plasticity, which may make psychotherapies and (other) kinds of interventions work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USAT/86041995007-image-15.jpeg?width=300&amp;amp;height=451&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Laura Pickard sought ketamine therapy for relief from depression and grief.

She had battled depression and anxiety since age 15, cycling through medications like Prozac and Wellbutrin. In 2022, her father died of an overdose, and just 16 months later, her mother died by suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Following her mother’s death, she paused her education at Baylor University and returned home to Los Angeles, where she began working with a counselor who specialized in loss. She described coming out of her depression as putting on glasses for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Before ketamine, everything took five times the amount of effort for me to do because of my depression,” Pickard says. “Going through my ketamine treatments, I woke up motivated to do things; I had energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Pickard has since done three maintenance sessions, which she credited with helping her return to school to finish her degree last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'I still get the sense that I was a little too young for it'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When Krystal started studying ketamine in the 1990s, it was still known as a horse tranquilizer or by the street name Special K. In recent years, high-profile figures like &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/03/19/what-is-ketamine-elon-musk/73025449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, Chrissy Teigen and &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2022/07/08/ketamine-therapy-depression-praised-celebs-heres-what-know/7776023001/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;amp;gca-cat=p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Sharon Osborne&lt;/a&gt; have talked about using the substance for therapeutic purposes, contributing to its name recognition. Most notably, abuse of the drug was linked to &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/12/15/matthew-perry-ketamine-effects/71936903007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Matthew Perry&lt;/a&gt;’s death after he was using ketamine under the care of a physician for the treatment of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ketamine therapy’s most common short-term side effects are dizziness and nausea, but in extreme cases, long-term, heavy use of ketamine is associated with memory problems, gastrointestinal issues, and urinary tract infections, according to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/ketamine#health-risks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37153136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2017 case study&lt;/a&gt; from the Yale Child Study Center found depressive symptoms dramatically reduced for adolescents ages 13 to 17 with treatment-resistant depression within 24 hours of receiving an infusion of the therapy, and the improvements lasted at least two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I really would just proceed with caution on this for kids because it's not really been studied in that age group,” says Dr. Ryan Sultan, a psychiatrist specializing in ketamine treatment at Integrative Psychiatry. “The younger the brain, the more unformed it is, and therefore the greater potential of negative effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lucy doesn’t regret the ketamine therapy, but says it’s a bigger step than she realized at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I still get the sense that I was a little too young for it, and I wonder, could I have tried something else?” Lucy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Krystal says that ketamine is most effective in a very narrow dose range: a doubled dose would lead to more side effects, but not more effectiveness, and halving the dose would lose the antidepressant effectiveness. He’s seen instances of misuse where people start using ketamine as many as eight times a day, leading their depression to worsen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lucy and Pickard receive treatment through intravenous (IV) ketamine therapy ‒ a legal but off-label use of the drug. The only FDA-approved form of the therapy is an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/esketamine-nasal-route/description/drg-20458442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;esketamine&lt;/a&gt; nasal spray known as Spravato, but the majority of ketamine therapy administered is through IV, according to Sultan. Neither form is FDA-approved for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The result is that the field of ketamine therapy goes unregulated. After the FDA &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250202084452/https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-nasal-spray-medication-treatment-resistant-depression-available-only-certified" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;approved esketamine in 2019,&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of independent, outpatient ketamine clinics sprang up around the country. These clinics might employ a mixture of anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and therapists, but quality and safety vary across clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Insurance rarely covers IV ketamine therapy, and users pay hundreds per session out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Krystal warns that people using ketamine for therapy outside of clinics often improperly administer it. Most of the ketamine distributed in the United States is done so illegally, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Ketamine-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;​”Adolescents are at greater risk for addiction problems, and so the concerns that I raise about people having access to ketamine at home are even heightened for adolescents,” Krystal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jacintha initially worried about introducing the feeling of ketamine to Lucy, but has spoken with Lucy about the dangers of seeking out that feeling in a non-clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Am I inadvertently introducing her to a euphoric feeling that she may want to continue pursuing in other ways?” Jacintha says. “If she no longer has access to ketamine, but she still wants to go back to the feeling that ketamine gave her, will that lead her into other types of drug abuse?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why ketamine therapy isn't a cure-all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Since April of 2023, Lucy has done four maintenance sessions, one every six months, which she utilizes in combination with talk therapy and antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s still prevalent today, sometimes depending on my stress and my mood.

			&lt;p&gt;A new test could help to diagnose memory issues associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="173505" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease in as little as three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279"&gt;recently published findings&lt;/a&gt;, the test, called the Fastball EEG test, may one day help doctors flag people who need further checks for Alzheimer's disease without the need for unnecessary waits or time-consuming procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; affects millions of people worldwide. It's a progressive condition, in which brain cells are slowly damaged and die – leading to memory loss, confusion, and difficulties with thinking and daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-discovers"&gt;Your Vision Can Predict Dementia 12 Years Before Diagnosis, Study Discovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease process begins long before symptoms manifest. Proteins called amyloid and tau gradually build up in the brain, forming plaques and tangles that interfere with communication between nerve cells. By the time memory problems are significant enough for diagnosis, much of the damage has already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173515" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642.jpg" alt="tau tangles" class="wp-image-173515 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_tau_tangles_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173515" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tangles of tau proteins can trigger the death of neurons, leading to Alzheimer's disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADerDrK0Vs/"&gt;selvanegra/Getty Images Pro/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the signs of Alzheimer's disease and symptoms &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-022-00642-9"&gt;don't develop similarly&lt;/a&gt; in all patients. This means the amount of amyloid plaques and tau tangles a person has in their brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-022-00642-9"&gt;doesn't always match&lt;/a&gt; the severity of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the amount of plaques and tangles can only be estimated via imaging or blood tests. These factors make Alzheimer's disease difficult to diagnose and predict how it will progress. This is why researchers are keen to develop tests that can spot signs of the disease earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, diagnosis has relied on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S212328"&gt;cognitive screening tests&lt;/a&gt;, where a doctor asks a patient to remember words, copy drawings, or complete problem-solving tasks. These tools are effective, but take time and require trained staff. They may also be stressful for the patients and can be influenced by factors such as a person's education level, their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/15333175221117006"&gt;language skills&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jintelligence7040022"&gt;test-related performance anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More advanced diagnostic options, including brain scans and laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (a fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord), can indicate the presence of Alzheimer's disease in the brain. But these tests are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2024.103911"&gt;expensive and invasive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173511" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642.jpg" alt="brain scans" class="wp-image-173511 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AD_brain_scans_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173511" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans can indicate risk of Alzheimer's, but are expensive. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEGJABe-88/"&gt;pixelshot/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/projects/diagnosing-dementia-using-fastball-neurocognitive-assessment/"&gt;Fastball EEG test&lt;/a&gt; uses a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking patients to actively recall or solve problems, it measures how the brain responds to images flashed on a screen. Participants first see a set of eight pictures, which they're asked to name but not memorise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, during the test, hundreds of images are shown in quick succession – around three per second. Every fifth image is one of the eight previously shown. The EEG headset records the brain's electrical activity, picking up tiny signals that reveal whether the brain recognises these familiar images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people, the recognition response is clear. But in people with &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (problems with thinking, memory, or problem-solving, which often precedes Alzheimer's disease) and especially those with memory issues, the response is weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the test's suitability, researchers recruited 106 participants to their study. This included 54 healthy adults and 52 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Among the latter group, some had memory-specific problems (amnestic MCI), while others had difficulties unrelated to memory – such as problems with attention (non-amnestic MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the Fastball test was sensitive enough to distinguish between these groups. Those with amnestic MCI showed significantly reduced brain responses to the familiar images compared to healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. In other words, the test quickly identified the kind of memory impairment most closely linked to early Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then repeated the test a year later. Some of the participants who'd only had mild cognitive impairment in the first test had progressed to either Alzheimer's disease dementia or another type of dementia, called &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/vascular-dementia"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, which manifests in symptoms similar to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also asked the participants who developed dementia to perform the standard cognitive tests currently used to diagnose Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants showed no or little difference in this test, which means the test wasn't sensitive enough to detect the transition from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. But with the Fastball test, the participants performed marginally worse than they had previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, of the 42 participants with mild cognitive impairment who repeated the Fastball test a year later, only eight had transitioned to dementia. So, although the results are very promising in illustrating the test's accuracy, they should be interpreted with caution as they're based on a small number of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the test is fast – lasting only three minutes. It also doesn't rely on the participant's effort, mood, or test-taking ability, which can influence cognitive test results. It can also be done at home or in a GP's office, which might reduce anxiety for patients and make it easier to reach a larger group of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study did not include other conditions where &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/worried-about-memory-problems/causes-of-memory-problems"&gt;memory impairment is also present&lt;/a&gt; – such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="173505" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or thyroid problems – so it cannot be used as a standalone diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease. Future studies in more diverse populations, which take these other conditions into account, will be needed to better understand the test's strengths, limitations, and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tests, which are currently in development, may be better for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease specifically. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/medical_tests#:%7E:text=Blood%20tests,-Researchers%20are%20investigating&amp;amp;text=These%20markers%20may%20include%20tau,tests%20to%20diagnose%20the%20disease."&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; could transform Alzheimer's diagnosis once they're more widely rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measure proteins linked to Alzheimer's and can give a snapshot of disease processes happening in the brain. Some tests currently being studied would only require a &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/releases_2023/finger-prick-blood-test-alzheimers-disease.asp"&gt;finger-prick of blood&lt;/a&gt;. If they prove to be accurate, this could mean patients could do these tests at home and mail them in for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools such as the Fastball test and blood tests could help shift the focus of Alzheimer's care from late diagnosis to early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying people at risk of the disease years earlier, doctors could recommend lifestyle changes, monitor patients more closely, or provide them with appropriate therapies earlier, while they can still make the most difference.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264519/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/molbev/msaf189" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molecular Biology and Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that the relatively high rate of autism-spectrum disorders in humans is likely due to how humans evolved in the past. The paper is titled "A general principle of neuronal evolution reveals a human accelerated neuron type potentially underlying the high prevalence of autism in humans."&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;About one in 31 (3.2%) children in the United States has been identified with autism spectrum disorder. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that around one in 100 children have autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+perspective/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;evolutionary perspective&lt;/a&gt;, many scientists believe that autism and schizophrenia may be unique to humans. It is very rare to find behaviors associated with the disorders in non-human primates. In addition, behaviors associated with those disorders generally involve cognitive traits like speech production and comprehension that are either unique to or much more sophisticated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of single cell RNA sequencing, it became possible to define specific cell types across the brain. As investigators published more large-scale datasets, it became clear that the mammalian brain contains a staggering array of neuronal cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, large-scale sequencing studies have identified extensive genetic changes in the brain unique to Homo sapiens—genomic elements that did not change much in mammalian evolution in general but evolved rapidly in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While previous investigations found that some cell types have remained more consistent throughout evolution than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers here investigated recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mammalian+brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mammalian brain&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the most abundant type of outer-layer brain neurons, L2/3 IT neurons, evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by dramatic changes in autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by natural selection specific to the human lineage. The researchers explain that although the results strongly suggest natural selection for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/autism+spectrum+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt;-associated genes, the reason why this conferred fitness benefits to human ancestors is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering this is difficult because we do not know what human-specific features of cognition, brain anatomy, and neuronal wiring gave human ancestors a fitness advantage, but the investigators here speculate that many of these genes are associated with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/developmental+delay/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;developmental delay&lt;/a&gt;, so their evolution could have contributed to the slower postnatal brain development in humans compared to chimpanzees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the capacity for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/speech+production/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;speech production&lt;/a&gt; and comprehension unique to humans is often affected by autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that the rapid evolution of autism-linked genes conferred a fitness advantage by slowing postnatal brain development or increasing the capacity for language; the lengthier brain development time in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/early+childhood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early childhood&lt;/a&gt; was beneficial to human evolution because it led to more complex thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that some of the same genetic changes that make the human brain unique also made humans more neurodiverse," said the paper's lead author, Alexander L. Starr.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the exact mechanisms through which alcohol accelerates liver damage remained unclear to scientists, that is till now. However, a 2025 research study discovered a fresh gut–liver pathway, which explains how chronic alcohol consumption damages liver tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new find&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team of Nature (PMID: 40836099), discovered that long-term alcohol consumption decreases the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (mAChR4) in the small intestine. The receptor mAChR4 plays a vital role in maintaining gut bacterial control through its function in goblet cells, which line the intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Critical signs that indicate the onset of a liver disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut lining contains goblet cells which produce GAPs (goblet cell-associated antigen passages). The immune system receives training through GAPs, to identify and regulate gut bacteria. The reduction of mAChR4 by alcohol consumption prevents goblet cells from creating proper GAPs. Because of this, the immune system becomes less capable of handling gut bacteria because of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens as a result&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of GAPs creates an environment where bacteria from the gut can escape through the gut barrier, to reach the liver. The liver becomes more susceptible to damage, when bacteria enters its tissue after reaching this organ. The research demonstrated this process occurred in both human liver biopsy samples and laboratory animal experiments. The research demonstrated that alcohol consumption resulted in decreased mAChR4 expression, which led to impaired defense mechanisms against harmful gut bacteria entering the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-liver-disease" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research established a direct link between alcohol consumption and liver damage through the following sequence of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small intestine contains lower levels of mAChR4, when people consume alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decrease in mAChR4 expression results in reduced goblet cell GAP production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system loses its ability to control gut bacteria when GAPs become scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria from the gut escape through the damaged gut wall to enter the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria entering the liver through this process intensify both alcohol-induced liver inflammation, and steatohepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition known as alcohol-associated liver disease, (ALD) encompasses different liver conditions which develop from prolonged alcohol consumption. The first stage of fatty liver disease known as steatosis, develops when liver cells store fat, but usually produces no noticeable symptoms. The progression of alcohol consumption leads to alcoholic steatohepatitis, which causes liver inflammation together with tissue damage. The progression of liver damage through fibrosis (scarring) eventually results in cirrhosis, which severely impairs liver function. The progression of cirrhosis results in liver failure, which creates dangerous complications that may require patients to receive a liver transplant. The research reveals how bacterial gut invasion leads to worsened inflammation and tissue damage in steatohepatitis and ALD stages, which creates new therapeutic possibilities to stop this destructive process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential for new treatments&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrated that GAP signaling restoration enables the immune system to fight bacterial infections effectively. The direct activation of mAChR4 in goblet cells of mice, protected their livers from alcohol-related damage. The discovery indicates that future medical treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease could focus on mAChR4, and its associated signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Requires further testing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the research data however, stems from animal experiments together with limited human biopsy tissue analysis. The medical field lacks evidence about using mAChR4 or gp130 immune pathway treatments for patients with alcohol-related liver damage. Additional clinical trials must be conducted to determine if these innovative methods will work safely and effectively for liver protection in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can one do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors around the world say that no amount of alcohol is safe, and one should not drink at all. If you however, enjoy drinking, keep it extemely occasional, ranging from once a week (1-2 drinks only) to a couple of times in a year. Any amount greater than this can increase your dependence on alcohol, which can lead to long-term alcohol-associated liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 02:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAJBVV95cUxOMm1rcXZMTW1zc05rS2dHbWd5dVhfUk5zY0NlZWJjQWg1UVJVSkRiVWg3M2pQR0RGdTM4WTZCZk4tNFowVGZBOGFJVTNLVFdyM2JKQW9jUmJscVZuSnNrbTdrdU9Cb0xJN1puemdjTWZibnk3a0d6VnFHdGVnZEJXWl9vYWlFcG1Td0NVa3Mya2xWZUx6Y3I2emlmT1pTQTlpTjVvczdGLWhBeUk2QkM3RjVyeFRZTVFOc3hvZF85aThYcDdLdWU3WThWd1lSSXB6UXEtMlBVbXBaNFlhV0M3NzB4TlFjNXo5WV9wV2Vibmszb1d6bWh0ZUZ5bENPaGRNOEpiZHNvUS1UOXA3dkZxSEU2MjFsUVl2SnFJalhKSHFZMGI5RHdpX1F4eWxxdDFDUW1mQk9tdE9LT1RGcjNxYg</guid></item><item><title>新研究发现，近一半的糖尿病患者不知道自己患有糖尿病- KHBS</title><link>https://www.4029tv.com/article/undiagnosed-diabetes-global-study/66017606</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						When was the last time you had your blood sugar checked? It might be worth looking into, a new study says.Forty-four percent of people age 15 and older living with diabetes are undiagnosed, so they don’t know they have it, according to data analysis published Monday in the journal The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology.The study looked at data from 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2023 in a systematic review of published literature and surveys. The findings at the global level are for people age 15 and older.“The majority of people with diabetes that we report on in the study have type 2 diabetes,” said Lauryn Stafford, the lead author of the study.Around 1 in 9 adults live with diabetes worldwide, according to the International Diabetes Foundation. In the United States, 11.6% of Americans have diabetes, according to 2021 data from the American Diabetes Association.“We found that 56% of people with diabetes are aware that they have the condition,” said Stafford, a researcher for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Globally, there’s a lot of variation geographically, and also by age. So, generally, higher-income countries were doing better at diagnosing people than low- and middle-income countries.”Younger people don’t know they have diabetesPeople under 35 years were much less likely to be diagnosed if they had diabetes than people in middle age or older. Just “20% of young adults with diabetes were aware of their condition,” Stafford said.Routine screenings aren’t promoted as much for young adults as for older adults. Many larger organizations, like the American Diabetes Association, suggest annual routine screenings for adults 35 and older.“You can survive with elevated glucose levels for many, many years,” Stafford said. “People end up getting diagnosed with diabetes only at the point where they have complications,” which are more common in older adults.Depending on how long a person has had diabetes before it’s discovered, the health impacts may vary.“Diagnosing diabetes early is important because it allows for timely management to prevent or delay long-term complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss,” said Rita Kalyani, chief scientific and medical officer at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study.Around one-third of adults are diagnosed with diabetes later than their earliest symptom, according to a 2018 study.What symptoms should you look for?“Symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, blurry vision, unexpected weight loss, and fatigue. However, in the early stages, most people with diabetes are asymptomatic, which highlights the importance of screening and diagnosis,” said Kalyani, a professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Johns Hopkins University.If you experience any of these symptoms or have a history of diabetes in your family, experts recommend you get a glucose screening.Globally, in 2023, about 40% of people with treated diabetes were getting optimal results and lowering their blood sugar, said Stafford. That’s why it’s important that future efforts focus on ensuring that more people receive and follow proper treatment post-diagnosis.That only 4 in 10 patients were seeing optimal results was surprising, as several well-established treatments, including insulin, Metformin and other drugs like GLP-1s, are available.People with diabetes likely also have other health issues, such as hypertension or chronic kidney disease, which can make treatment complex, Stafford added.Can you prevent diabetes?It depends.While there is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes, there are many ways to prevent the more common form of type 2 diabetes.Reducing the amount of red and processed meats you eat can help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes, as previously reported by CNN. You could do this with a Mediterranean diet or by introducing more plant-based foods to your meals.In addition, limit the amount of ultraprocessed foods you eat, adding more whole foods, like fruits and nuts, instead.Incorporating physical activity into your regular routine can also decrease your risk of developing not only diabetes but also other chronic diseases. Fast walking for at least 15 minutes a day is just one form of exercise you can do.“I think, ultimately, if we can also focus more on the risk factors for developing diabetes — preventing people from needing to be diagnosed in the first place — that is also critical,” Stafford said.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai"&gt;Ancient Japanese samurai&lt;/a&gt; were warriors of distinction, with a reputation for discipline and mastery of precision. Their deliberate and composed approach to movement could be an effective strength training method for elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized controlled trial by researchers from Tohoku University in Japan shows the daily practice of Rei-ho – a mindful practice of physical etiquette involving slow and careful sitting, standing, and walking movements – can boost strength in the knees, potentially protecting seniors against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-risk-of-dementia"&gt;falls and injuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to do, requires no equipment, and takes just five minutes a day to see the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;Brain Boost Linked to Exercise Can Last Several Years, Scientists Find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Knee extension strength – the force used to straighten knees – is a key measure of mobility and daily functioning," &lt;a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/traditional_japanese_samurai_daily_behavior_improves_leg_strength.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; exercise physiologist Ayaka Ogasawara. "These exciting results suggest that Rei-ho may help seniors maintain their independence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 34 healthy adults aged over 20 with no experience in Rei-ho, and split them into two groups. One group was instructed to continue their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supercharge-your-daily-walk-with-these-5-simple-changes"&gt;daily activities&lt;/a&gt;, while the other was asked to spend five minutes following between 20 and 22 Rei-ho squats and sit-to-stand exercises once a day, four days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173468" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises.jpg" alt="Rei-ho exercises" class="wp-image-173468 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises-321x415.jpg 321w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/StudyExercises-600x775.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Typical sitting and standing motions (b and d), compared with body positions in Rei-ho (a and c).

Importantly, the reduction in strength tends to be more pronounced in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the exercise routine used in the research relies solely on the body's own weight, and is slow and deliberate, reducing the risk of injury and common consequences of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000094530"&gt;other exercises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;such as increased blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the number of people involved in the study was relatively small, and participants were trusted to perform the tasks without supervision, other studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2018.12.016"&gt;reached similar conclusions&lt;/a&gt;, and in older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is far from the first time that traditional approaches to health have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-traditional-african-diet-appears-to-boost-the-immune-system"&gt;shown to be beneficial&lt;/a&gt; – perhaps something to bear in mind in the fast-changing modern world, where much of our focus is on the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it's also valuable that those outside of Japan who want to try Rei-ho would also be able to experience a unique aspect of ancient Japanese tradition in addition to the health benefits," &lt;a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/traditional_japanese_samurai_daily_behavior_improves_leg_strength.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; exercise physiologist Akira Sato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1620/tjem.2025.J099"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Virginia families are hitting roadblocks while getting the new COVID-19 vaccine, as shifting federal rules spark confusion over pharmacy prescription requirements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/09/05/statement-from-the-virginia-department-of-health-regarding-the-2025-26-covid-19-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacists can give vaccines in two ways: with a prescription from a medical provider, or under statewide protocols that allow vaccinations without a prescription — as long as they follow the immunization schedule from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s current immunization schedule lists the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, but not the 2025-26 version, which is why a prescription is now required for the newer shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Hardin, a 75-year-old resident of Haymarket, told WTOP he was asked to present a prescription recently when he tried to get a vaccination at a Giant Foods Pharmacy near his home. He said he’s never been asked for a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To me, this is kind of a federal bureaucracy … that’s really useless,” Hardin said. “If you think about it, what doctor is going to say, ‘No, I’m not going to give you a prescription for a COVID shot?’ I mean, they’ll all give it to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardin said he is retired veteran and can get a shot at a local military base. But he said that’s at least 20 miles away and not at all convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several states have already acted on similar concerns. In Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania, pharmacists can give COVID-19 vaccines without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee meets Sept. 18 and 19 to vote on updated COVID-19 shots. If approved, pharmacists could give the vaccines without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just think the government is trying to dissuade citizens from getting a shot,” Hardin said. “I think that’s wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"She told me she had to get weekly blood tests to make sure everything was okay, which confused me at first, until I figured out it was due to RH incompatibility.

    &lt;p&gt;When Don Searles went to a recent party, he didn't want to show up empty-handed. So he made peanut brittle using an old family recipe — with a modern-day twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We added the marijuana," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party was hosted by 74-year-old Gayle Crawley at the Trilogy retirement community an hour east of San Francisco, where lately the golf course has a new competitor for popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2021 and 2023, cannabis use among Americans 65 and older went up 46%, according to a study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834781?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crawley said those numbers reflect that marijuana is a "good solution to a lot of medicinal issues." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Springer, a professor at UC San Francisco, warns that THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, may carry health risks, no matter how seniors ingest it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they are smoking marijuana, we can be pretty confident that they're harming their cardiovascular system," Springer told CBS News, adding that if they're eating THC, "they're not without risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers found cannabis use is linked to a doubled risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, a 29% higher risk for acute coronary syndrome and 20% higher risk for stroke, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cannabis-cardiovascular-heart-disease-death-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in June. The authors analyzed data from 24 studies published from 2016 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searles, who suffers from chronic pain after a motorcycle accident five years ago, said he isn't surprised by the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I go to my doctor and he says, geez, quit drinking milk. Uh, stay away from the sugar. What isn't bad for you nowadays?" Searles said.&lt;/p&gt;

I could go on but, to cut to the chase, if this organ isn’t functioning well then your health will eventually be affected. And poor liver function is not solely linked to heavy drinking. Your risk might be more significant than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“When people think about liver disease, they think it relates to alcohol intake,” says Philip Newsome, professor of hepatology at King’s College London in King’s College Hospital and clinical adviser to the British Liver Trust (BLT). “Many people have no awareness that poor diets, a lack of exercise, being overweight and carrying too much fat around the middle means they likely have fat in and on their liver, which raises the risk of problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;According to the BLT, liver disease is the only major disease to see death rates continually rising, with figures having quadrupled in the past 50 years. Among the most common conditions is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is a chronic condition caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It can affect people of all ages, although it is midlifers who are most likely to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Significant liver damage doesn’t happen after one weekend of bingeing but takes place over many years of flogging the organ,” says Sarah Di Lorenzo, a clinical nutritionist based in Sydney who works with doctors and consultants to treat diet-related health issues. “But, as robust as it is, even our liver has a breaking point and the damage you may have caused in your twenties, thirties and forties may not become apparent until you are in your fifties or sixties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Left untreated, it can lead to liver cancer or failure in a small number of people, and if you have a lot of abdominal fat or type 2 diabetes, another risk factor for liver disease, you should ask your doctor for blood tests. But the good news is that the BLT says nine out of ten cases could be prevented if we tend to our liver’s health more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/liver-disease-silent-killer-how-to-reduce-your-risk-health-advice-symptoms-7tg7klg0b" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liver disease is a silent killer. Here’s how to reduce your risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It was a spike in the number of middle-aged patients with early signs of liver damage referred to her clinic that inspired Di Lorenzo to write her new book, &lt;i&gt;The Liver Repair Plan&lt;/i&gt;. In it she says there is much we can do to regenerate our liver and even reverse inflammation in people with MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Our liver is remarkably forgiving. “Its powers of self-repair are phenomenal,” Di Lorenzo says. “But its ability to regenerate diminishes with age so we really need to start caring for our liver as soon as we can.” Here’s what she recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Cut down on alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;According to the BLT there is no such thing as a safe alcohol intake when it comes to liver health. The more you drink, the harder your liver has to work to process it. “Our liver has to use an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to convert the ethanol in alcohol and break it down into acetaldehyde,” Di Lorenzo says. “Another enzyme — aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) — then breaks down the acetaldehyde into acetates, which are metabolised before leaving the body with carbon dioxide, so it’s a long and very taxing process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both binge-drinking and moderate drinking can over time lead to liver inflammation and ultimately scarring or cirrhosis. “The risks get higher as you age because your liver breaks down substances slower than when you were younger, meaning alcohol toxins stay in the body longer,” Di Lorenzo says. “If you drink too much, cut down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Drink 3-4 cups of coffee each day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Drinking black coffee — even instant or decaf — could place you at a lower risk of liver disease, according to researchers at the universities of Southampton and Edinburgh, who tracked 384,818 coffee drinkers and 109,767 people who didn’t drink the black stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Over 10.7 years, participants were monitored for any type of liver disease and showed that coffee-drinkers had a 21 per cent reduced risk of chronic liver disease and a 49 per cent reduced risk of early death from the condition. Their findings, published in BMC Public Health, revealed that drinking 3-4 cups of coffee a day offered the biggest benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Coffee is one of the best drinks for liver health as it helps to prevent the build-up of fat in the liver and increase antioxidants such as glutathione that protect against liver damage,” Di Lorenzo says. “It helps to lower the risk of cirrhosis, inflammation and liver disease in general, which is good news for coffee drinkers like myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Lose weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are carrying too much excess body fat, particularly around the middle, then losing it is a non-negotiable. “There’s a direct link between weight and fatty liver disease or MASLD,” Di Lorenzo says. “Overeating builds up fat on the body but also in the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers from Boston University School of Medicine found that losing 7 to 10 per cent — 10-20lb (5-10kg) for someone weighing 14st (89kg) — of your body weight can reverse liver damage in some people who are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In his own studies, Professor Newsome has recently discovered that semaglutide-containing weight loss drugs such as Wegovy show promise in improving metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), an advanced form of fatty liver disease where fat build-up has caused inflammation and scar tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed through biopsies taken after 72 weeks that 62.9 per cent of patients taking semaglutide had significant reductions in liver fat and inflammation, compared with 34.3 per cent of a placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Don’t bother with liver detox supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There’s a huge market for “liver detox” and “liver function” supplements containing ingredients such as milk thistle extract, artichoke extract, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), turmeric extract and choline. While it is tempting to think you can heal your liver by popping a daily pill, they are not worth the expense. The BLT advises against taking any supplements without first speaking to your GP and says many can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Milk thistle is widely regarded as a liver cleanser but there is a lack of evidence to support its use and the BLT says it can cause side-effects that might be worse if you have underlying liver issues. “Anything that claims to detox your liver is a waste of money,” Di Lorenzo says. “The best way to detox your liver is to avoid processed foods, too much sugar and alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Do take a vitamin D supplement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Newsome says the one supplement we should be taking, at least from the end of September until April, is vitamin D. “I’d take an extremely cautious view of any supplements [for liver health] with the exception of vitamin D,” he says. A recent study of 3,905,594 people showed that those with low levels of the vitamin were at the highest risk of liver disease and scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And in Nature Communications another group of researchers said that taking vitamin D supplements helped to reduce liver inflammation. “People with chronic liver disease usually have vitamin D deficiency,” Di Lorenzo says. “It’s absolutely essential for liver and general health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Increase your step count&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Any form of physical activity is good for liver health. “If you can walk for 15 minutes 3-4 times a day, that is a good starting point,” Newsome says. A recent study of 91,000 people in the UK by researchers at the University of Oxford found that the more steps people take each day, the lower their risk of developing a fatty liver and MASLD. Every 1,000 steps higher (representing 10 minutes of walking) was associated with a 12 per cent lower risk of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Taking a walk after a meal is even better. “Liver disease is driven by inflammation and inflammation can be increased by elevated blood glucose,” Di Lorenzo says. “Blood sugars spike after a meal and walking helps to offset that.” Even 2-3 minutes at a brisk pace is better for your liver than sitting down after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Don’t bother with DIY liver function tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are dozens of DIY liver function tests available to order online but the BLT does not recommend any home tests apart from the free NHS hepatitis C test. Other home tests cannot tell you if you have a liver condition or not and you should speak to your GP or a medical professional if concerned. You might be referred for a transient elastography (TE) test, also called a FibroScan. This tells you how stiff your liver is — a healthy liver is soft and supple — but won’t diagnose a liver condition on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The BLT offers free FibroScans through its Love Your Liver roadshow (see website for details). If you want to have one privately you can do so at clinics.

The latest case grabbing the nation’s attention is that of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee who was stabbed to death last month in Charlotte, North Carolina. Footage released on September 5 shows an act of senseless, horrifying violence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zarutska’s killer had been previously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/08/us-news/trump-rages-over-murder-of-ukrainian-refugee-iryna-zarutska-horrific-killings-require-horrible-actions/" rel&gt;diagnosed with schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and many murders are committed by individuals with psychotic disorders. But not all of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes the attackers are driven by ideology, as appears to have been the case with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, or of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. (For more on this troubling trend of political violence, read Peter Savodnik’s “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/robin-westman-and-the-rise-of-american-nihilism-minneapolis-shooting" rel&gt;Robin Westman and the Rise of American Nihilism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”) And sometimes, individuals without a political agenda or psychotic disorders nevertheless display a persistent, disproportionate tendency toward aggression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychologist Abigail Marsh refers to these conditions as “disorders of aggression.” In her piece today, she explains how such disorders arise from a mix of genetic and environmental factors—and why society’s failure to confront and study them puts us all at risk. —The Editors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year, someone was pushed onto the subway tracks in New York City &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/nyregion/new-york-subway-shove-survivor.html" rel&gt;roughly once every 14 days.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; On New Year’s Eve, 2024, 45-year-old Joseph Lynskey &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/nyregion/new-york-subway-shove-survivor.html" rel&gt;joined their number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As he stood waiting for a train, surveillance video shows a man pushing Lynskey from behind onto the tracks. The fall fractured Lynskey’s skull and ruptured his spleen. Soon a suspect was arrested, 23-year-old Kamel Hawkins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Lynskey survived and, with treatment, has been able to resume normal activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was not Hawkins’ first reported offense.

Some can actually be nutritious and play a valuable role in a balanced diet. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some ultra-processed foods can provide health benefits, especially when considered in dietary context. Experts urge a smarter system for guiding food choices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Swinburne research is challenging the long-held belief that ultra-processed foods are all bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While snacks and soft drinks show consistently bad health outcomes, products like wholegrain fortified cereals and certain dairy products contain neutral or potentially beneficial effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study author Swinburne Discipline Lead of Dietetics Associate Professor Jimmy Louie, says the question ‘Are ultra-processed foods bad?’ requires a more nuanced answer than a simple yes or no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Headlines make it sound like all ultra-processed foods are bad, but the truth is more complicated. Some can offer real nutritional value and fit comfortably into a healthy diet. That kind of oversimplification can mislead the public and distract from the most pressing dietary risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Louie explains that the health implications of food depend on the context of their consumption within overall dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultra-processed products often provide cost-effective sources of essential nutrients for economically disadvantaged populations and can contribute to reduced food waste through extended shelf-life capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not everyone can live on only minimally processed foods. Nutritionally sound processed foods can be a healthy, practical choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rethinking the Nova system&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study reviewed the Nova system, which categorises foods into four groups based on their level of processing, from fresh or minimally processed items to ultra-processed products. The widely used system is controversial because of how it defines and labels processed versus ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Louie is calling for a system that looks at both processing and nutrition, so people get clearer, fairer guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the classification of foods based on processing has made valuable contributions to our understanding of health, it fails to capture important distinctions in nutritional quality, processing methods, and health implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People deserve advice that makes that distinction. The evidence shows we can be smarter about which processed foods we avoid and which we keep.”&lt;/p&gt;

It has also been shown to negatively impact memory and the ability to retain new information, potentially leading to dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sleeping too much can do just as much harm as sleeping too little, with oversleeping also having links to heart disease, weight gain, diabetes, cognitive impairment and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-8169b250-52c8-11f0-9e5c-7974185a1260" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. It all begs the question, what is the right amount of sleep? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend seven to nine hours per night, but one in three adults isn't getting enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During sleep, the brain clears out daily metabolic toxins and transfers short-term memories into long-term storage, solidifying learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inadequate sleep disrupts these critical processes, which is why chronic sleep loss is strongly linked to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-3363f080-8a80-11f0-a5d6-4fadf49cb6e6"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oversleeping is often a red flag that the quality of sleep is very poor or that an underlying health condition, such as sleep apnea, depression, brain damage or other chronic illnesses, is forcing the body to demand more rest in an attempt to recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spending excessive time in bed can also disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake rhythms, causing a groggy and disoriented feeling upon waking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Allowing yourself to fall asleep at a reasonable time and wake up naturally will let you pinpoint how many hours you need to feel your best in the morning (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep needs change throughout life. Babies require the most, about 12 to 17 hours, while adults generally need less due to full brain development, though sufficient sleep remains essential. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sleep during adulthood is critical for maintaining cognitive function, emotional stability and physical health,' Dr Leah Kaylor, a licensed clinical psychologist practicing in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-e9efad90-52c1-11f0-8092-09145ac91c26" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Yet, this is often the stage of life where sleep is most neglected due to work, family responsibilities and social commitments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To optimize sleep quickly, aim to wake up at the end of a full sleep cycle, which lasts approximately 90 minutes. Most adults require five to six cycles per night, which translates to 7.5 to nine hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, if you need to wake up at 7am, try to be asleep by 11:15pm to complete five full cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding your ideal sleep duration may take a few nights of adjustment, but timing your sleep around these cycles can help you wake up feeling more refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep, getting the wrong amount or having a sleep disorder like sleep apnea can shorten a person’s lifetime, with some studies showing it shaves off 4.7 years for women and 2.4 years for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Good sleep, according to Dr Sajad Zalzala, chief medical officer of telehealth company AgelessRx, involves at least 120 minutes in REM (the phase of sleep during which dreaming happens), at least 100 minutes in slow-wave sleep (the most restorative phase) and a minimum 90 percent sleep efficiency score (the percentage of total time spent asleep while in bed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you’re not sure how much sleep you need, start by paying attention to how you feel,' Dr Kaylor said. 'Are you waking up refreshed? Or are you relying on caffeine to get through the day?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oversleeping has a well-documented association with dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2017, researchers at the Framingham Heart Study followed 2,457 older adults with an average age of 72 for a full decade, meticulously tracking their sleep habits and diagnosing cases of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were grouped based on their self-reported nightly sleep: short sleepers (under six hours), the control group (six to nine hours), and long sleepers (over nine hours). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also conducted MRI scans to measure brain volume and administered cognitive tests to get a full picture of neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While short sleep showed no significant link to dementia, sleeping more than nine hours a night was strongly associated with a higher risk of dementia. Long sleepers were &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5373785/#:~:text=We%20observed%20234%20cases%20of,clinical%20dementia%20within%2010%20years."&gt;twice as likely to develop&lt;/a&gt; the disease over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Leah Kaylor (pictured), a licensed clinical psychologist in Virginia, told the Daily Mail that a 'sleep vacation' allows you to tune into your body, sleep when it feels right and wake up naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans revealed that long sleep duration was associated with smaller brain volume, indicating accelerated brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research suggested that when an individual's sleep duration increased to over nine hours in the years leading up to the study, it acted as a potent marker of early brain decay, more than doubling their risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While oversleeping can be a symptom of neurological decline, sleeping too little speeds it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK researchers analyzed data from nearly 8,000 people to see if midlife sleep habits influence future dementia risk, not just reflect early symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tracked self-reported sleep duration at ages 50, 60, and 70 over a 25-year period. To verify accuracy, some participants also wore sleep-tracking accelerometers, which supported the self-reported trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed that sleeping six hours or fewer per night at the ages of 50 and 60 was associated with &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;a 22 percent and 37 percent&lt;/a&gt; increased risk, respectively, of developing dementia later in life compared to those who slept a regular seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that the link between short sleep and dementia is not attributable to underlying mental health conditions, suggesting that insufficient sleep itself may be an independent risk factor for cognitive decline decades down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maintaining proper sleep hygiene could be the key to warding off cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To figure out one's ideal sleeping time, Dr Zalzala recommends allowing the body two weeks to go to bed and wake up naturally based on its signals, taking what is known as a sleep vacation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you have the luxury of taking a vacation that isn't jam-packed with activities, you can really tune into your body,' Dr Kaylor told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Without the pressure of an alarm clock, you can let your body fall asleep when it feels right and wake up naturally.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The basis of sleep vacations is that the body naturally knows how much sleep a person needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the first few days, most people catch up on lost sleep, often experiencing REM rebound, where the brain prioritizes REM sleep to recover from deprivation. This can lead to grogginess for several days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, he added, 'Once the debt has been paid, natural sleep stabilization and patterns should start to emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The solid line in this graph depicts the average risk of dying [the Y axis] based on sleep duration [the X axis]. The dash line represents the confidence intervals, which provide a range in which scientists can be sure the true risk of death lies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But then a person should observe these patterns for a few days to pin down the duration of sleep that makes a person feel the best - the more days and therefore data points, the more accurate the picture.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a successful sleep vacation, cut out caffeine. It disrupts the body’s internal clock, impairing natural sleep-wake regulation and hormone release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you can get away with it (which most people can't) cut out caffeine altogether,' Dr Kaylor said. 'The next best option is to reduce caffeine where possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recommends gradually reducing caffeine intake three to five days ahead of the sleep vacation by cutting down - ideally to one cup of coffee or tea per day, or a maximum of 100 milligrams of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By reducing or removing caffeine, you'll allow your body to reset its natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to deeper, more refreshing sleep.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone has the luxury of taking a sleep vacation or living life without an alarm clock.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way to determine your ideal sleep duration is by combining self-experimentation with sleep tracking, monitoring energy levels, and assessing cognitive function.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To track sleep, Dr Zalzala recommends a wearable sleep tracker such as a Whoop, FitBit, Oura Ring or Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:29:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOZUMzdmQ0SHVYYTBGUjY1azI2dFpjcFdtb2V4aVA0NUdKSUJEYWgxLUR0WWVwXzhzak96bm1HVE9QNjZGTF9JX1BhOXJ5Qk5udlZyZU9fMExyRFhUQkswM25meXJwQndSblNlQXVqdTYtcHJyZjhLclE2QlNPbEtfd3NiYmdPYjFYb0M1cUZjOUxXNVhxOW9rQdIBngFBVV95cUxPMmhWMlhpdjNPMFlacWJOWWI1X0oyc2I2N2YyUktIZFcxS0psSGNfemJXYXJDTGJ0Q0ZRdWp5MDFJZGxFdmlpa0t5ams3NXg5V0ZCV1Q2Uy1QN0RSREZHcjV6TkQ4cHFjaDZLNVg2TFVDTlk4V2M0WFBCbU9Ob3dON2hOWE9WN0xMTUxOYkU1bFNpXzNsSlR6SmRJMW5nUQ</guid></item><item><title>随着疫苗接种收紧，加利福尼亚州的新冠肺炎住院治疗增加了一倍-旧金山纪事报</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/california-covid-hospitalizations-vaccines-21037066.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California is seeing a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections just as access to updated vaccines is becoming more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carlos Avila Gonzalez/S.F.

Research and experts point to several reasons why you may be experiencing a hankering for a treat and offer solutions for satisfying your cravings in a healthy way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-you-cut-out-too-much-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. You Cut Out Too Much Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you choose to restrict a certain food or restrict your sugar intake,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you may experience a phenomenon called &lt;strong&gt;perceived deprivation&lt;/strong&gt;, a state in which your brain feels deprived of something even if there is no real nutritional deficiency. As a result, your brain craves that specific food.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Cravings are a learned response," said &lt;a href="https://cse.tcu.edu/faculty-staff/view/anne-vanbeber" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anne VanBeber, PhD, RD,&lt;/a&gt; a professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at Texas Christian University.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-food-ads-and-social-media-spark-cravings"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Food Ads and Social Media Spark Cravings &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may also experience cravings due to external environmental cues, which are extremely prominent in today's environment. Research has found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sudden-spicy-food-craving-11776710" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exposure to food cues&lt;/a&gt; significantly increases cravings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This is in advertising, social media, grocery ads, food packaging," VanBeber said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to VanBeber, the physiological responses these cues activate include increased salivation, heart rate, secretion of digestive enzymes and hormones, and brain activity related to achieving a reward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-sugar-activates-your-brains-reward-system"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Sugar Activates Your Brain's Reward System &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sugar tastes so good because it activates reward circuits in the brain and boosts the secretion of serotonin and dopamine, which are feel-good hormones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This explains why emotional or stress eating is so common: research shows that in many people, poor mood stimulates eating high-carbohydrate, high-fat foods because they stimulate the release of endorphins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Having sweets at the end of a meal physically brings happiness," VanBeber said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, science shows the boost is temporary, and long-term high sugar consumption has resulted in low basal dopamine levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-you-may-have-a-blood-sugar-imbalance"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. You May Have a Blood Sugar Imbalance &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat an imbalanced meal, you may be left with a blood sugar spike that can ultimately cause you to crave sweets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is most common when you eat a carb-heavy meal without the other necessary components. Your body releases insulin in response to the carbs, but releasing too much may lead to low blood sugar and a subsequent sugar craving. And so, you consume more sugar, and the cycle repeats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best way to combat this is to consume balanced meals with protein, fiber, and healthy fats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-your-taste-buds-want-something-new"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Your Taste Buds Want Something New &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sensory-specific satiety refers to the reduced pleasure you experience after you've consumed a sufficient amount of certain foods or flavors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After eating, your body gets tired of the savory flavors. Your taste buds crave something different—usually, sweets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We can reduce this by incorporating sweet tastes along with sour, bitter, salty, and umami in the main part of the meal," VanBeber said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This leads to eating fewer calories and feeling fuller sooner," she added.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has shown that the desire for sweets and salty snacks gradually increases throughout the day and is more prominent in the evening, said &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/joan-salge-blake-ms-rd-ldn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Joan Salge Blake, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and nutrition professor at Boston University.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Research suggests that craving for a certain food may be habitual and that as the day goes on, the ability to have less self-control later in the day may be due to mental fatigue," Blake said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study found that while hunger for meals typically occurred at lunch and dinner time, snack and dessert cravings increased throughout the day with less coherence with hunger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study found that the body's circadian rhythm increases cravings for sweet, starchy, and salty foods in the evenings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While having a small sweet treat every now and then is perfectly fine, it's important to be aware of your sugar consumption, especially at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're craving something sweet but want to make a healthy choice, VanBeber said a piece of fruit is always a good choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other options, according to Blake, include:

Narrower the arteries, higher the risk of early blockage. But the worst part is, blocked artery symptoms aren’t easy to identify. Eating clean, following a healthy lifestyle aren’t enough. However, certain symptoms can be identified through standard medical tests. In a recent video Cardiovascular Surgeon Dr Jeremy London shared 4 tests that can help identify blocked arteries and lower the risk of Cardiovascular complications. Take a look..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Track your Blood Pressure with regular check-ups&lt;br&gt;                  &lt;p type="image" title="Doctors recommend regular blood pressure check-ups" msid="123747068" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jeremy explains blood pressure gets easily modified by lifestyle changes. According to The World Health Organisation (WHO), only 12% of the Indian population have blood pressure under control. High blood pressure is a ‘silent killer’ that increases the risk of blocked arteries as it damages the artery walls and leads to the accumulation of fatty deposits. Tracking blood pressure is critical for early detection and can lower the risk of blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Blood Panel can detect hidden risks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Advances Blood Panel goes beyond the standard blood tests. It is a set of blood tests that identifies the hidden dangers of Atherosclerosis or Plaque build-up in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a basic blood panel usually checks cholesterol and sugar, an Advances Blood Panel goes beyond that and may reveal number and type of cholesterol particles, inflammation in blood vessels and blood clotting tendency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/ask-the-doctor-heart-attack-despite-low-cholesterol" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers have found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, even if cholesterol numbers are low, one can still develop blocked arteries that lead to the risk of heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEXA Scan- measures the ‘dangerous’ body fat&lt;br&gt;                  &lt;p type="image" title="DEXA scan can identify Visceral fat" msid="123747086" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat or the ‘dangerous’ fat around internal organs of the abdominal area is a risk factor for Artery Blockage. Cardiovascular Surgeon Dr London describes Visceral fat as ‘an engine for inflammation’. The third test Dr London recommends is DEXA scan or the Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. DEXA Scan reveals the level of Visceral fat in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32127334/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Identification of Visceral fat is crucial &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;as it secretes inflammatory proteins into the bloodstream that damage the Endothelium, the inner lining of arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;b&gt;VO2 Max test- ‘most powerful determinants of longevity’&lt;br&gt;                  &lt;p type="image" title="VO2 Max test measures cardiovascular efficiency" msid="123747093" hostid="83"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth test Dr London recommends and describes as the most powerful determinants of longevity is the VO2 Max Test. This Maximum Oxygen Uptake test measures Cardiovascular efficiency and reflects aerobic fitness. While athletes are familiar with the VO2 test, Cardiologists too, are recommending this test, as early signs of a low VO2 max can lead to artery blockage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/taking-magnesium-pharmacist-reveals-five-positive-side-effects-of-taking-magnesium-supplements-you-must-know/amp_articleshow/123739316.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read more: Taking magnesium pharmacist reveals five positive side effects of taking magnesium supplements you must know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;See more: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/heart-health-doctor-shares-five-ways-to-strengthen-the-arteries-naturally/photostory/123700920.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Heart health: Doctor shares five ways to strengthen the arteries naturally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="js_tbl_readmore_btn" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 21:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwJBVV95cUxNWlhXWlNzeXlkdDlqejdwVWZSSUJ4R1gyVHpUVzN5STNJX29WX2pIbTVuRm1MdVBUUjBtdmZMNjFsT3ZCNm11YXVCWnR2VGJRNl85b3N2M2wtR1VBLXZsTExjZHBvdkJaUXJ1VlM5VFc4TFNmUzVGTFJpZTdJU3ZnZTkwdEtqMDFsVWM4MS1SWmtvNndwWHZKeTdpSjlWU2xNYnBwVmtYUXdhTl9uRUVwa1N5RTJORE5fR0hjZUFucHVnWkU3RXRTSXdZVXkyUVVYelJ6M2lzb0gzMzRFZXlEU3ZZSjktNnNWanFXTnY4Y1RFelNqRWx5eDBzTzlwTUlGM3pGdlBmYXVoNHc4MzljQ3Z1WQ</guid></item><item><title>这种突破性药物可能是最终的秃头治疗方法。以下是科学家们所说的话。-男性健康</title><link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/a66016637/baldness-cure-pp405/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="0" class="css-1xkwtv6 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="1" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="1.0"&gt;Researchers have developed a new drug that regrows hair by reactivating dormant hair follicle cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="1.1"&gt;The approach is different than current treatments, which only slow down hair loss.

In periods of activity, these cells awaken and regenerate the hair follicle, developing into the different components that make up hair. But when they’re resting, the hair stops growing and eventually falls out. With illness, stress, or an unlucky roll of the genetic dice, these stem cells can become permanently dormant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But Christofk and her collaborator, William Lowry, Ph.D., a stem cell biologist at UCLA, discovered a way to wake them back up.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“We found that hair follicle stem cells have a really different metabolism when they&lt;strong data-node-id="8.1"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’re asleep versus when they’re active and giving rise to new hair,”  Christofk says. Specifically, hair follicle stem cells that are “on” have more lactate, a key molecule for creating energy without oxygen. (Most cells create energy via a route that requires oxygen). So Christofk wondered whether increasing lactate levels in sleeping hair-follicle stem cells might switch them on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To test their theory, the researchers took advantage of a quirk of mouse biology. Mice are born without fur and their first few rounds of hair growth are synchronized. In this initial period, then, scientists can pinpoint the timing of the stem cells’ active and resting phases with exquisite precision. In one experiment, for example, they bred mice in which they could turn off the gene for lactate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that produces lactate. Unlike their normal peers, who regrew their fur 70 days after being shaved, these mice remained bald. Analysis confirmed that the animals had low lactate levels in their hair-follicle stem cells, and that lactate has a positive effect on hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;On the flip side, when researchers genetically impaired the mice’s ability to move pyruvate (a molecule that turns into lactate) into their mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell), more of it was converted into lactate instead. As a result, these mice grew hair more quickly than their normal counterparts. The scientists then confirmed this by treating normal mice with UK-5099, a molecule that blocks the same pyruvate-moving protein. Those mice also sprouted hair earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“It was remarkable,” Christofk says. “We saw hair growing on these mice at a time when they shouldn’t be growing hair.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Lowry and Christofk soon recruited fellow UCLA professor and medicinal chemist, Michael Jung, Ph.D., who helped them design an analog of UK-5099—dubbed PP405, after a major thoroughfare in Southern California. Not only was PP405 better at inhibiting the protein that moved pyruvate into mitochondria, its action was confined to the scalp. “Even when we put it in the blood, it’s not stable in the blood,” Christofk says. This means it’s unlikely to cause side effects, a problem that plagues other drugs that treat hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The three collaborators founded Pelage Pharmaceuticals in Los Angeles to continue research on PP405, with the aim of bringing it to market. To date, the drug, applied topically to the scalp, has gone through two clinical trials to test safety. The next target: a trial to test its effectiveness, set to begin next year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, as a scientist focused on fundamental mechanisms, Christofk is interested in how metabolism influences a cell’s decisions. We know that recreating the environment of an active hair-follicle stem cell (for high lactate levels) can awaken a dormant one, even when other signals are telling it to stay quiet. But how is lactate doing this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Unfortunately, the answer to this question—which could spur other advances in regenerative medicine—may be a long way off. Federal funding for the project fell victim to the Trump Administration’s widespread cuts at UCLA. Christofk and her collaborators are now scrambling to find alternative sources of support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Meanwhile, Pelage Pharmaceuticals will proceed with the next phase of clinical trials for PP405. And while Christofk wouldn’t speculate on a go-to-market date, she’s optimistic about the drug’s prospects. “We hope that it’ll be useful for more people, and also for people suffering from different types of hair loss” like chemotherapy-induced hair loss, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="19" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div data-node-id="gallery-carousel" aria-label="Gallery Carousel" aria-roledescription="carousel" role="region" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="PP0-16-0" data-theme-key="carousel-container" class="css-a6tzot e1kgjrvy4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1t3oi0e e1kgjrvy3"&gt;&lt;h2 id="PP0-16-0" data-theme-key="carousel-hed" class="css-4i2xvz e1kgjrvy5"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-79dz2t eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Get Stronger With An Exclusive MH Program&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="inner-carousel" data-theme-key="carousel-inner-wrapper" class="css-cbaigl e1kgjrvy0"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="item" data-theme-key="carousel-item" class="css-m9cksi e1kgjrvy6"&gt;&lt;div class="css-33w51f e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div class="css-u94zfv e1ghppmw16"&gt;&lt;div class="css-9xcc4r e1ghppmw15"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/recomp-landing-page-67733437617bd.png?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=640:*" alt="body recomp central" title="body recomp central" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-s7sxc4 e1ghppmw12"&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-mwacyu e1geg53v2"&gt;COURTESY DAVIDSON; ANDRE L.

If you spot a kissing bug outside, Gangloff-Kaufmann recommends avoiding it. “If you find a kissing bug indoors...you can collect it in a jar and freeze it to kill it or squish it, but be careful not to contact the innards,” she says.  “The risk of exposure to the organisms that cause Chagas disease is low but, especially in southern states, not zero.” (Dr. Beatty says that commercially-available pesticides seem to work well against kissing bugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s also important to thoroughly clean all areas the bug came into contact with using a solution of 10% bleach and 90% water, per the TDSHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And, if you find that kissing bugs are making their way inside your home, Gangloff-Kaufmann recommends sealing openings around doors, windows, and wires and pipes to keep them out in the future. &lt;br data-node-id="31.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="chagas-disease-treatment" data-node-id="32" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="32.0"&gt;Chagas disease treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="there-are-anti-parasitic-treatments-available-for-chagas-disease-but-dr-russo-says-they-work-best-when-theyre-given-early-those-include-the-drugs-benznidazole-and-nifurtimox-beyond-that-doctors-will-usually-treat-the-symptoms-dr-adalja-says" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are anti-parasitic treatments available for Chagas disease, but Dr. Russo says they work best when they’re given early.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bariatric surgery is generally considered the most effective solution for long-term and significant weight loss, with studies showing patients lose significantly more body weight after surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expected weight loss is about 10 to 15 percent for Wegovy and Ozempic and 15 to 21 percent for Zepbound and Mounjaro, which compares to 25 to 35 percent for bariatric surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery - which can cost in excess of $10,000 - is more invasive, has associated risks like leaks, bleeding, blood clots, and infections, which can be severe and even fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longer-term issues can include nutritional deficiencies, gallstones, bowel obstruction, acid reflux, and scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the Tufts team believe their new drug can mimic the effects of weight loss surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other GLP-1 medications, the scientists say the new drug targets four 'dimmer switches' in the body, which manage appetite, satiety, blood sugar and energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The four hormones it acts on are GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and Peptide YY (PYY).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Tristan Dinsmore, PhD, a researcher at Tufts University, explained to Fox News: 'We built a single experimental peptide that works like four hormones at once, so we're not pushing one button too hard. Instead, we're nudging four 'dimmer switches' together... [It helps to] balance things out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tristan Dinsmore, a graduate student in the Kumar lab and the lead author of the study, added: 'There is one more hormone we wanted to bring in to complete a weight control quartet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's called peptide YY (PYY). This molecule is also secreted by the gut after we eat a meal, and its job is to reduce appetite and slow the process of emptying food from the stomach, but via different mechanisms than either GLP-1 or GIP. It may also be involved in directly burning off fat.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PYY is from a separate and structurally unrelated class of hormones than the first three, so blending the different molecules was a difficult process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Justine Martin lost 33lbs on Mounjaro but needed to stop due to side effects. She reported the food noise coming back, gaining 5.5lbs and her 'resolve hanging by a thread'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the medication is far off from being available as it is still in development and has not yet been tested in human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are used by over 15 million adults in the US, or 4.5 percent of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their effectiveness, they have drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their effect may not last after discontinuing use, and side effects including osteoporosis and muscle loss have raised concerns about long-term harms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also induce nausea, which can make it difficult to stay the course of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For certain weight loss medications, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as Wegovy and Zepbound), there are reports of severe side effects, including suicidal ideation and gastrointestinal issues like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, evidence is conflicting, and regulatory agencies like the FDA have not established a direct causal link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, after stopping weight loss drugs, patients tend to regain approximately two-thirds of the weight they lost within a year, with significant weight gain occurring as hormone levels return to their pre-treatment state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists claim to have hit upon a new weight loss drug which is more than twice as effective and comes with less side effects than Ozempic and Wegovy (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are used by over 15 million adults in the US, or 4.5 percent of the population&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Krishna Kumar, a professor of chemistry at Tufts who led research on the new weight loss drug, explains: 'The biggest problem with GLP-1 drugs is that they have to be injected once a week, and they can induce a very strong feeling of nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As much as 40 percent of people using these drugs give up after the first month.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounjaro or Zepbound (the brand names for tirzepatide) have less nausea associated with them and they work by activating both the GLP-1 and GIP hormone pathways, making them 'dual-acting' drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently another drug called retatrutide, which targets three hormone pathways, in clinical trials but the Tufts team say their 'four-in-one' hormone drug would be a game-changer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Martin Beinborn, a visiting scholar in the department of chemistry, concluded: 'By hitting four different hormone receptors at the same time, we hope to improve the chances of averaging out such variation toward the goal of achieving greater and more consistent overall effectiveness.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Tufts report appeared in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c04095"&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 20:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQVXJ5Yk91VWxpdkZYeTU4eUJOS2pfR3R3a0JudGI3b0ZJcFFUVzBUblExcWNYLW12T1Q2dEtmbVUwYVZ0dVBvZnZ2Ui1RYmxlRlNvYlF0QU5ab3lGZ3NTaDFpZkxHTF9NVFRnOFFrZngydDgweldWcTVSeEt6cWtEYUt5V1hxeWlSV2N0N1ZUNVdpTFJDR3BsRUZIdG3SAaIBQVVfeXFMT25BV28tc0R2NW5DVFpJdE84QnRiYkp5dHFWRVZQLUpZVTdjem55OFpXX3YxbWxUbFZEZENySmtRY1hDOXVjejdPTHFqVW9fOFhzaTk0N0VRQm9rV0JKTDM4ZUh5ZzJqNndtcFFTTXJ5UE1ZRTV1dTljSXdLWVhxT1VvLVR6c3hyenoyMTJiWjZXazhJSGtZSGhUVmwtV0NNVENB</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心警告说，致命的接吻虫病在美国各地呈上升趋势- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/deadly-kissing-bug-disease-is-on-the-rise-across-the-us-cdc-warns</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

The parasite can also be contracted through contaminated food, blood products, or organ donations.

Research that identifies non-pharmacologic opportunities to promote healthy aging, such as diet, sleep, and lifestyle, can help reduce disease burden and support healthier, more fulfilling lives in later years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dashti is the lead author of a new study recently published in the journal &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01035-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; that found the time of day people eat their meals — especially &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; — may also affect longevity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The timing of when we eat, known more commonly now as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11603425/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;chrononutrition&lt;/a&gt;, has recently been recognized as an important factor that influences metabolism, sleep, and overall health,” Dashti explained. “Most studies, however, have focused on younger adults or night-shift workers. Older adults may be particularly affected by shifts in meal timing because of health challenges and lifestyle transitions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So far, little is known about meal timing in older adults and how changes in meal timing affect long-term health,” he continued. “Our study aimed to address this gap by examining decades of data on meal timing in older adults and its relationship with long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Dashti and his team found that in general, as we age, we tend to eat breakfast and dinner later in the day, which can narrow how much time a person eats during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers discovered that study participants who ate their breakfast later in the day were consistently associated with physical and mental health conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933" target="_blank" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, fatigue, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dental-problems" target="_blank" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;or&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dental-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;al health problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our analysis, we found that a range of illnesses were often linked to eating breakfast later in the day,” Dashti detailed. “Having depression, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, fatigue, or poor oral health may make it harder for older adults to eat earlier, which can shift overall meal timing patterns, and particularly the timing of breakfast. This suggests that later breakfast timing could serve as a marker of underlying health problems, providing doctors and caregivers with a simple, additional signal of declining health over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additionally, scientists learned that eating breakfast later in the day was also linked to an increased mortality risk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association between shifts toward later breakfast and higher mortality risk indicates that meal timing may reflect more than just personal preference and could be tied to biological aging or health decline,” Dashti said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the effect we found was very modest, it highlights that even small changes in meal timing over the years could provide insight into broader health risks as people age.”&lt;br&gt;— Hassan Dashti, PhD, RD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because our study is observational, the findings need to be confirmed in future experimental research,” he continued. “Next steps for this research include testing whether adjusting meal timing, such as encouraging earlier breakfasts or maintaining consistent meal schedules, can directly improve health and longevity in older adults. Additional randomized trials and studies will be essential to confirm and expand these results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard commented that the study’s outcome makes logical sense to what she sees in clinical practice and outpatient settings in terms of patterns, natural alterations with age and disease states, and what we know to be true physiologically as we get older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Later breakfast timing in older adults is a frequent observation in geriatrics, especially those with current depression, fatigue, oral health complaints, and who may be more isolated or have mobility challenges,” she explained. “Furthermore, this scenario can be a ‘catch 22,’ where eating breakfast later is a risk for many of these factors or exacerbates them due to nutrient depletion, lessened amounts of joy, pleasure, and sensory stimulation.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These study results are observational, so not proof of causation, but it fits broader chrononutrition science showing that aligning meals with daytime &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/circadian-rhythms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;circadian&lt;/a&gt; biology supports metabolic and overall health.”&lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In practice, I educate and encourage strategies around meal timing as a simple, actionable lever to help all individuals — children, teens, athletes, adults, and older adults — meet &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/196279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and overall energy and nutrient needs, stabilize energy, and anchor daily routines. Meal timing and meal composition are complementary partners in our journey toward health and overall well-being,” Richard added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard said that delaying the first meal of the day makes it harder to hit total &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, and evenly distributed protein — key for muscle and mood — before the day “gets away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental health and later eating times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, medication effectiveness can be impacted, which may further affect mood, overall health status, and can start to further deplete current nutrient stores (if not already deficient.) Later breakfast often travels with later bed/wake times, irregular meals, less activity, and more snacking — patterns associated with poorer mental health outcomes and higher risk of cognitive deterioration in community-dwelling older adults.” &lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard encouraged readers to meet with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) for tailored tips and ideas on how and what they specifically need regarding meal planning and timing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also offered these general tips on meal timing, especially for older adults:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchor the Day Early:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to eat breakfast within one to two hours of waking, most days. A simple pattern like breakfast: 7–8 a.m., lunch: noon–1 p.m., dinner: 5–7 p.m. works for many families and individuals, allowing for possible snacks as necessary, keeping a consistent window of sleep and fasting open ~10–12 hours, and try to avoid snacking two to three hours before bed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-Load Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Target ~25–30 g protein at breakfast (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/health-benefits-of-berries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/283659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; + veg; protein-fortified &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;). Distributing protein across meals supports muscle function, brain health, satiation, and numerous other functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maneuver Barriers with Consideration &amp;amp; Care (&amp;amp; Support):&lt;/strong&gt; Taste or smell changes? Foods with a higher profile in aromatics like herbs may help, adjusting acidity or alkalinity in recipes or adjusting salt, sugar, and fat also address some of these observations. Chewing trouble? Adapting foods to soft textures (i.e. applesauce versus a crunchy whole &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/267290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;), or smaller, more frequent portions may address. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Early and Evenly:&lt;/strong&gt; A protein-strong breakfast, a steady midday meal, and a light, timely dinner, hydration in between, coupled with laughter and loved ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:37:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNRzhrb2hYb280NF9uSEJQR0cxUFNYYTBnWXdHajJuR0d3NmRyOUFjdDRCazc1UGtSOGM1NWtkeGFndkEwUU5pMzk4cDdOUlNyX2NQU3UxMUZwNVRjNnRNY0JHd2EtN3lOYVFHVDUxcU1uUV94am5fU01Tbm9OdHcxMjhFWkhuQ0pjZDNTLUE3eHRtSjJQQ0pnRXl4ZnhERU1kbndzcDB1c0RPMFJLNTNR</guid></item><item><title>您的脖子尺寸揭示了您的健康状况-今日日本</title><link>https://japantoday.com/category/features/health/What-your-neck-size-reveals-about-your-health</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNeEw2OWNXTWpTbk5fS1hpRmtPbTVHVUNmR00td2pmTjlpaXh5eU02XzJvYWpWR3MyODVUUmlPdVRnZF9sdGx3Um5tbEpVYVR1LXFWWS1PNF9EWGJibzkzYW9rR01iTTJJT2NoMTdKMmJhZmtKcUZTSzhzM181R2d6Vlh1XzUtM1lyR1E5VHpBQzZpNTk4X21Waw?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What your neck size reveals about your health&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Japan Today&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAJBVV95cUxPbWJpMVRkbzRTY1dvc1liYUZkN3J6NWNxNWNGbkV0Tk1tb3pkVFdUUGtNWEpIMXphbnNHc042RFJEWERIRUhRWTlkZ1FwenRjVVl6TDRJQlpFRVBuRW9JUTlZNS1QdjdEUHVPdkJ1SlhhY2xsdGlvNnZYc05VVmJlZUhYLXlqYTZUREdLc0xrU3kyWWZ0bUtSWU9PSkpZVG1zNTZVcTJCX3lGZjhyOG9Da3ZQUVZmSzVjcnhOdlVOaTVsRDNyNGlMX2Y0cUVwSUowNXFvVHVCLU0zc0dKenpFRHpXd2FoNUtDYmhNN2t3cGdWTU1wM1kySzEwTVZfR3JNeU5FMWZ2Vk02NHRqSjNmWQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;From heart health to diabetes risk: What neck size REVEALS about one's overall health&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Times of India&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNaFFhTkc1Y3pkSm9SRnBfMU9WV3N5dU0zT1RfcF9Ia0tkV0w5UjVMdVdRYjNZZ3JxRkNPbHd1RFIxYkxpajRTRmNYcWNiLU14aUJuRm1vV2NGWEdOX2ZFTGd0X0lfbUszQWJlVjlFd1cxRGQxbEp5SnFPOHZ3N1Jyc2NLUl8?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Neck size another tool to measure health risks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Medical Brief&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE93OGVaNVo2eVV6WUVjVEZNOXVNTjFVcWg3S1hraXNNWjhiRDdZMzZjQkpHTURjOVBxdkF4STlwNFZ3aVF3UERmczJ2TThZY2E5?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;17 inches&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Komando.com&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOeHVHc0lPUnREaXpoanNFYkNrSmtDZThyVHJuc09MS3BKT3l6TWp2UTlnbEhGNHdmMWlkLXgtZnhkN21uWXNHZkdaSjBmcy1zNFhWOWJMLVdPQzBXM01sYzdGdEotaEUwenVGLS12UmR2cFhaUktVY3FSRTBWSFNDaVZSbjNxUFE3MFV5Qi0xaXYyc1JSS1d5N2hOcEVyTVpVS0IwUWJBckRoaGNHZWNzemNuQnc3TTl1OHkzWE1pVTd4LWc?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Neck size may reveal more about your health than you realise, say doctors&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>Japan Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 19:37:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNeEw2OWNXTWpTbk5fS1hpRmtPbTVHVUNmR00td2pmTjlpaXh5eU02XzJvYWpWR3MyODVUUmlPdVRnZF9sdGx3Um5tbEpVYVR1LXFWWS1PNF9EWGJibzkzYW9rR01iTTJJT2NoMTdKMmJhZmtKcUZTSzhzM181R2d6Vlh1XzUtM1lyR1E5VHpBQzZpNTk4X21Waw</guid></item><item><title>一些心脏病发作可能由细菌引发- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/some-heart-attacks-might-be-triggered-by-germs-2000655424</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Germs might be even worse for us than we thought. New research suggests that certain infections could be a contributing factor to heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Finland and the UK conducted the study, which examined arterial plaques taken from people who died from heart disease and others. They found these plaques often contained a dormant layer of bacterial biofilm; they also found evidence that bacteria released from this biofilm can then trigger heart attacks. Though not yet definitive, the study may someday point to another way we can prevent or treat heart attacks, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This finding adds to the current conception of the pathogenesis of [heart attacks],” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A potential double whammy of infection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many studies have &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/11/28/infections-may-be-a-trigger-for-heart-attack-stroke"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that some infections can make us more vulnerable to a heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction. But according to the study researchers, it’s been difficult to pin down the exact mechanisms involved in this potential chain of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers studied arterial plaques—the deposits of cholesterol and other debris that can build up along our arteries—collected from people who suddenly died as well as from patients who had their plaque surgically removed. Using various methods, including genetic sequencing, they identified several groups of bacteria normally found in our mouths lodged within these plaques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These bacteria had formed biofilms, hardy and sticky layers of bacterial colonies. The bacteria inside a biofilm are much better at fending off the immune system and antibiotics than they would be individually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the biofilms stuck deep inside plaques didn’t trigger the immune system. But some plaques contained bacteria shaken loose from the biofilm, and these bacteria did seem to spark an immune response and resulting inflammation. What’s more, the presence of these released bacteria also appeared to be associated with ruptured plaques and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking. Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material—DNA—from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques,” said lead author Pekka Karhunen, a researcher at Tampere University in Finland, in a &lt;a href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/news/myocardial-infarction-may-be-infectious-disease"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say that it may take a sort of double whammy for these bacteria to stir up heart trouble. Typically, the biofilm inside these plaques remains hidden and dormant. But when something else activates the bacteria—such as a secondary viral infection—the bacteria grow and set off the immune system, causing inflammation that breaks open the plaque. The broken-off plaque can then produce clots that block the artery’s blood flow, causing a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Unanswered questions and new leads&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s results will have to be validated by additional studies, ideally from other research teams. But if confirmed, their work could certainly help us better combat heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s possible, the researchers say, that giving a short course of antibiotics to people whose heart attacks are caused by these bacteria could improve their outcomes, for instance. Someday, we might even be able to reliably prevent heart attacks using vaccines against these bacteria or common secondary infectious triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Notably, several studies have already suggested people vaccinated against &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/study-flu-vaccination-reduces-risk-heart-attack"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/incidence-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-was-lower-after-covid-19-vaccination"&gt;covid-19&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years"&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt; have a lower risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered why older people are more likely to suffer severely from the flu, and can now use their findings to address this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;i&gt;PNAS&lt;/i&gt;, experts discovered that older people produce a glycosylated protein called apolipoprotein D (ApoD), which is involved in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lipid+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lipid metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation, at much higher levels than in younger people. This has the effect of reducing the patient's ability to resist virus infection, resulting in a more serious disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team established that highly elevated ApoD production with age in the lung drives extensive tissue damage during infection to reduce the protective antiviral type I interferon response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/international+collaboration/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;international collaboration&lt;/a&gt; led by scientists from the China Agricultural University, University of Nottingham, Institute of Microbiology (Chinese Academy of Sciences), National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) and the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aging is a leading risk factor in influenza-related deaths. Furthermore, the global population is aging at an unprecedented rate in human history, posing major issues for health care and the economy. So we need to find out why older patients often suffer more severely from influenza virus infection," says Professor Kin-Chow Chang from the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science at the University of Nottingham, and co-author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In this new study, the team investigated the mechanisms behind increased severity of influenza virus infection with age using an aging-mouse model and appropriate donor human tissue sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They identified ApoD as an age-related cell factor that impairs the activation of the immune system's antiviral response to influenza virus infection by causing extensive breakdown of mitochondria (mitophagy) resulting in greater production of virus and lung damage during infection. Mitochondria are essential for cellular production of energy and for induction of protective interferons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ApoD is therefore a target for therapeutic intervention to protect against severe influenza virus infection in the elderly which would have a major impact on reducing morbidity and mortality in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/aging+population/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;aging population&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Chang, added, "There is now an exciting opportunity to therapeutically ameliorate disease severity of the elderly from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/influenza+virus+infection/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;influenza virus infection&lt;/a&gt; by the inhibitory targeting of ApoD."&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a question that has puzzled both philosophers and neuroscientists for decades, but has proved notoriously difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study that recorded patterns of brain activity in 15 participants suggests that colours are represented and processed in the same way in the brains of different people. The findings were published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/i&gt;on 8 September&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we know that when you see red or green or whatever colour, that it activates your brain very similarly to my brain,” says study co-author Andreas Bartels, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Tubingen and the Max Planck Institute, both in Tubingen, Germany. “Even at a very low level, things are represented similarly across different brains, and that is a fundamentally new discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartels and his colleague Michael Bannert wanted to explore how different colours are represented in parts of the brain associated with vision, and how consistent this is across different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01252-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02901-3/d41586-025-02901-3_50911966.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brand-new colour created by tricking human eyes with laser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activity in the brains of a group of participants while they viewed different colours. This allowed them to create a map of brain activity that showed how each hue was represented neurologically. They then trained a machine learning model called a linear classifier on this data, and used it to predict which colours were being viewed by members of a second group of study participants, on the basis of their brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus is no longer the menace that five years ago unleashed a pandemic, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-kennedy-rfk-congress-senate-vaccines-covid-deaths-hospitals-efa457f139dabcce6f54c0ac2c590512"&gt;caused a million U.S. deaths&lt;/a&gt; and spurred government mask mandates and gathering restrictions. Demand for COVID vaccines has fallen, with some 60% in the U.S. showing little or no interest, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-covid-19-vaccine-update/"&gt;August Kaiser Family Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But current virus variants continue to spread burning throats, fevers and other miseries. The disease remains more dangerous for seniors and younger people with preexisting health conditions. Those who do want to get the shot and thereby reduce risk of severe illness face conflicting recommendations from federal, state and other health officials, plus uncertainty over access and whether insurance will cover the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never has our population been more confused than now,” said John ​Swartzberg, a clinical professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal regulators, led by U.S. Health Secretary and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., approved new shots in August but limited access for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the federal government authorized and recommended shots for adults and children six months and older. But when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 shots for the 2025-2026 season last month, it authorized them only for seniors and younger people with at least one high-risk medical condition, such as cancer or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 18, an advisory panel at the CDC is set to consider recommendations about vaccine eligibility. Earlier this year, Kennedy replaced the entire CDC panel, naming several doctors and researchers who have repeatedly questioned the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the panel makes its conclusions, health insurers are in a holding pattern. They typically follow the panel’s recommendations when deciding which vaccinations to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elissa Harrington, an East Bay spokesperson for Kaiser, said the state’s largest insurer was reviewing the FDA’s guidelines and awaiting the CDC’s recommendations. The health giant will also evaluate the opinions of “relevant medical societies, to ensure safe and effective administration of the COVID vaccine,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kaiser Permanente is committed to making the 2025-26 COVID vaccine available at no cost to children and adults for protection from severe illness from COVID,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That coverage will be key for patients, said Andrew Noymer, professor of population health and disease prevention at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The thing is, are the insurance companies going to pay for it? Because a lot of people will balk at the price,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Currently, seniors and younger adults with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;certain medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; can get the jab at CVS and Walgreens pharmacies, spokespersons said. The pharmacies will also give the vaccine to healthy people outside of those categories if they can get a prescription from their doctor. CVS will only take walk-in appointments for these patients, said spokesperson Amy Thibault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the criteria for a prescription is unclear. And without insurance coverage, the out-of-pocket of a shot is $150 or higher, presenting another barrier to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further muddying the waters, Californians will likely have to parse dueling recommendations on vaccine use. Gov. Gavin Newsom this week announced that California will develop its own “science-based” immunization recommendations in a partnership with other West Coast states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ll do that until the federal government begins to return to a rational process — we hope,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician who leads the Washington-based nonprofit American Public Health Association, which opposes Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, California is bucking the feds &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Covid19Vaccines.aspx"&gt;by recommending broader access&lt;/a&gt; to the COVID-19 vaccine than what the FDA has approved. The state is citing the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duel over vaccines arrived during a summertime COVID-19 wave in the Bay Area and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrations of the disease in wastewater are high throughout the Bay Area. But the wave is far less severe than the darkest days of the pandemic. In Alameda County, just one death was reported in the last week of August — far lower than the peak of more than 80 weekly deaths in January 2021. However, hospitalizations from COVID-19 were on the rise this summer in the county, from 17 in June to 73 the week of August 18. Hospitalizations about doubled in Santa Clara County, from 32 in early June to 59 on August 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to the virus is most risky for seniors, very young children and other high-risk people. Officials are asking locals to consider masking up in some settings, like crowded, indoor gatherings — and get the jab. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a1.htm"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, immunization lowers the chance of landing in the hospital because of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting vaccinated continues to be the best way to protect yourself from COVID and other serious illnesses,” a spokesperson for the Santa Clara County public health department said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it remains to be seen whether Newsom’s alliance with other West Coast states will actually improve access to the jab, experts told Bay Area News Group. California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii are in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be successful, the West Coast vaccine partnership will need to go beyond vaccine use recommendations and ensure that insurers continue to cover the COVID-19 vaccine for the general public, Noymer said. He added the caveat that insurers may not have to be forced and could decide on their own to cover the jab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if Newsom is considering that. A spokesperson for the governor’s office referred Bay Area News Group to the California Department of Public Health. A spokesperson for the health agency side-stepped questions about insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the coming weeks, the alliance will finalize shared plans and principles to strengthen public access to vaccines and other public health measures that protect us,” spokesperson Grant Boyken said in an email. “Much work remains to be done, and CDPH will provide more information as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johannesburg —&lt;/em&gt; The Minister of Health for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Samuel Roger Kamba, confirmed last week an outbreak of the highly infectious Zaire strain of Ebola virus disease in the country's Central Kasai Province. He said 16 deaths and 28 suspected cases had been confirmed, including four suspected infections among health care workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Health Organization regional director for Africa Mohamed Janabi said the first case, known as the index case, was a "34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted on August 20 and passed away on August 25 with typical features for hemorrhagic fever; bloody diarrhea, bleeding from the nose, vomiting, and bleeding from the rectum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected wildlife, often bats, and can then spread through bodily fluids through close human-to-human contact. The WHO &lt;a href="https://sante.gouv.cd/actualites/declaration-officielle-reapparition-de-la-maladie-a-virus-ebola-souche-zaire-a-boulape-b-u-l-a-p-e-kasai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said that&lt;/a&gt;, as of Sept. 4, the case fatality rate in the Congo outbreak was 57%, with 80% of the cases in people aged 15 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the sixth Ebola outbreak within seven years in Congo, making it the highest concentration of outbreaks since the virus was first discovered in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of first responders arrived Sunday in the Bulape health zone, where the outbreak has struck, with medical supplies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

"As a global community, we need to work together to stop this virus, as diseases do not respect borders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we know (from past outbreaks) is you need to get supplies and resources as soon as possible to stop transmission," Otim added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-withdraw-us-world-health-organization/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the U.S. — long a key stakeholder and largest donor to the agency — would be pulling out of the WHO, with the White House citing "the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration, at the time, also accused the WHO of demanding "unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO warned almost immediately that, given the uncertainty over future U.S. funding, it &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/world-health-organization-who-cutbacks-trump-withdrawal-us-funding/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;was cutting back spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in ways that could impact its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congo's health care system was already overburdened as it &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mpox-outbreak-2024-vaccines-congo-africa-challenges/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;battles to contain an mpox outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, with roughly 130,000 suspected cases since last year and about 2,000 deaths now recorded, the WHO said at the briefing last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the response is the fact that the nearest medical isolation unit to the outbreak only has 15 beds, and road access from Kinshasa can take up to three days, further delaying the arrival of medical teams and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO has already delivered about 13 tons of emergency medical supplies to Congo to help contain and treat the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other African nations have put border entry points and health facilities on high alert to detect any possible Ebola cases.&lt;/p&gt;

I am in a suburban shopping complex on a Tuesday afternoon, getting a massage from an Aescape robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aescape &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/about" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; itself as a “pioneering lifestyle robotics company” that is “revolutionizing the wellness industry by introducing exceptional massage experiences”. Put simply, they make robot masseuses: cushioned tables with two large, white, robotic arms that rub your body based on your preferences and preselected programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I love massages – I am never happier than when the profane flesh sack I call my body is being kneaded like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WHs7CLJErmQ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt;. So I opt for a 30-minute “Power Up”, which costs $60 and promises to leave me feeling “invigorated and alert”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ccording to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benefits-of-massage-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mayo Clinic Health System&lt;/a&gt;, massage therapy can help with a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, sports injuries, digestive disorders, headaches and soft tissue sprains. It can also improve circulation, strengthen the body’s immune response, lower stress levels and increase energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But is a massage from a machine as good as a massage from a person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cd87f66-3485-4c1b-aab5-b832a3d228c2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is lymphatic drainage massage and why do celebrities love it?","elementId":"2cd87f66-3485-4c1b-aab5-b832a3d228c2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/feb/22/what-is-lymphatic-drainage-massage-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There are so many contraptions out there. My mom has a massage chair and I use a Theragun at home,” says Crista de la Garza, a board-certified massage therapist in Colorado. While there can be value in these tools, De la Garza says she is not worried about a robot coming for her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;First, there are real physical benefits to being touched by a person. During the early pandemic, for example, when people were isolating and social distancing, many reported feeling “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/28/the-power-of-touch-is-this-the-sense-we-have-missed-most" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;skin hunger&lt;/a&gt;” – a sense of deprivation and abandonment that comes from not getting enough physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A 2024 paper in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01841-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; said that receiving touch was “of critical importance” and found that touch interventions helped reduce pain and feelings of depression and anxiety in adults. The paper also found that touch interventions from objects or robots “resulted in similar physical benefits, but lower mental health benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is a powerful thing to be touched safely and appropriately and therapeutically,” says De la Garza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In fairness, Aescape’s &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/faqs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; says it “is not about replacing therapists”. Instead, “it’s about enhancing their work and addressing the industry’s labor shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="937245ad-92c8-4a5f-85cf-95756c168898" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A robot masseuse made by Aescape.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Aescape&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nothing can replace a human,” the efficient, blond receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment. I’m late because of parking woes, but the machine doesn’t care. It’s a regular spa, with manicures, pedicures, human massages and crystals for sale at the front desk. On our way to the robot’s chamber, she says the Aescape has been popular, especially with clients who “aren’t comfortable being touched by a stranger”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inside, she hands me a high-compression, Aescape-branded top and leggings to &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/news/what-to-wear-to-a-massage" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wear&lt;/a&gt; during my treatment. Apparently, they help enhance the machine’s “body detection”. I lie down on the table and hold very still while the Aescape scans my body. She shows me the screen controls and an emergency button that I can press if anything goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What kind of music would I like to listen to? Lo-fi ambient jazz, classic rock or a playlist called “brat”? I can view an unsettlingly detailed outline of my body – they didn’t need to depict my saddle bags so clearly – or soothing videos of the ocean, a snowy mountain or a rainy forest. I can adjust the height of my headrest and change the pressure of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the things that makes De la Garza skeptical about robot massage is that it “makes you think too much”. Getting massaged by a person involves more surrender – the therapist controls most of the experience, she says, and the client can turn off their brain: “The client’s job is to breathe, communicate as needed, and simply be in a relaxed state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Indeed, I find myself distracted by the urge to tweak the music and scenery. Do I like looking at snow? It’s OK. Can I relax to the “brat” playlist? No – back to ambient lo-fi. Is that really what my butt looks like?

What if the powerful robotic arms skewered my soft flesh like a pile of antipasti? I, on the other hand, was more worried it wouldn’t be strong enough, and that my knots of tension would remain coiled and tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the massage is enjoyable. The robot’s blunt, plastic hands are gently warmed. They can’t knead and poke as precisely as human fingertips, but their ministrations feel pleasant. Actually, the hands are more like knobs, roughly the size and shape of small Dutch clogs. It feels a little like someone pressing their fist into your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the end of my session, I feel looser and more relaxed than I had at the beginning. I don’t feel invigorated, exactly, but I do think I could drop into a deep, dreamless sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is certainly no substitute for a real massage. I like the surrender and precision of a normal massage, and the Aescape can’t massage the head, hands or feet.

Subsequent chemical analysis of the leachate found medical masks also released bisphenol B, an endocrine-disrupting chemical that acts like oestrogen when absorbed into the bodies of humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Taking into account the total amount of single-use face masks produced during the height of the pandemic, the researchers estimated they led to the release of 128-214kg of bisphenol B into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bogush said: “We can’t ignore the environmental cost of single-use masks, especially when we know that the microplastics and chemicals they release can negatively affect both people and ecosystems. As we move forward, it’s vital that we raise awareness of these risks, support the development of more sustainable alternatives and make informed choices to protect our health and the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 16:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNaWdoUnJqM2U3TmhRREZpaXlmSjkzVjFiRXBTTjBId2d1NHFzZm44UzZuRVNFY05oOHlrdTI3VVNYa2xTNEhsdl9IbE5GQW9GeU92b1AwN0MyelpvRjJrQjJHcHp1eTIwQ2pZUGdkV0RxYXpqMU55djNmUU1kQUxsU3ZCYnhnNDJHM293TW1YUlpvc1J6WjBuZW9pZXlOUQ</guid></item><item><title>工作人员从坎伯兰建筑区倾倒的自卸卡车中救出人员- WJAR</title><link>https://turnto10.com/news/local/crews-rescue-person-from-tipped-over-dump-truck-in-cumberland-construction-zone-sept-8-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;(WJAR)  — &lt;/span&gt;The Cumberland Fire Department responded to a tipped over dump truck at a Cumberland construction zone on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department responded around 7:13 a.m. to 50 Lynch Place for the reported accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding officers found a heavy-duty quarry-type dump truck with a person inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department says that wearing a seatbelt saved the victim from further injury, but that they had suffered a significant injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First responders used hydraulic rescue tools to free the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crews transported the victim to Rhode Island Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJAR</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 15:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPLUljZ2d2aHhfQ0ZBaVNsdVFROWFqYlVrYVBqTFl1YmZOOXdaeFZ5Qnd3SHpaUC1rM01jRnRTT0hlLXN2UTNZTU9kUG02T0w2cWE0YW0xRzFhZ2Uxc3JiT210a0tkYzlPR1U2Q1doTkxqbDlnM19vcHJhdk1NX0VMWHlyY3NDRmQzWVhJZjEzeG96eDUza1pLYkNlSmZfY2NUaWxmd2RleVIwZVUxd0hha1dGSldERTNiNVVEODMxR0U</guid></item><item><title>胃肠病学家警告说，到30岁时，每天只喝1杯苏打水就可能导致脂肪肝晚期： “即使是年轻、健康的人……” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-warns-just-1-soda-a-day-can-lead-to-advanced-fatty-liver-by-age-30-even-young-healthy-people-101757343916280.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-warns-just-1-soda-a-day-can-lead-to-advanced-fatty-liver-by-age-30-even-young-healthy-people-101757343916280.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soda has become a staple in many people's diets, from office lunches to late-night snacks.

A forward-leaning head or slouched posture not only stresses the joints but collapses the ribcage, which shrinks the space where the lungs, liver, stomach and other organs can live, and increases pressure within the abdomen, preventing the stomach and intestines from naturally expanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Posture walking focuses on maintaining an upright stance with the head balanced directly over the spine, shoulders relaxed yet open, and core lightly engaged (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A slouched posture can compress the stomach and intestines, slowing gut motility and worsening various GI issues, including bloating, reflux and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By keeping the spine tall and the head stacked over the body, posture walking gives the gut more room to function, helping food move smoothly through the digestive tract and supporting overall digestive health,' Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proper posture improves breathing and stamina by allowing the lungs and diaphragm to expand fully and maximize the amount of oxygen a person takes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts continuously warn of developing tech neck, the posture a person adopts when they hunch over their phone. The chin tilts down toward the chest, and the head juts forward in front of the shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding a forward tech neck position opens the airways, which can reduce fatigue and boost stamina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Craig Voll, clinical assistant professor in the Purdue Department of Health and Kinesiology, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/news/2025/05/purdue-kinesiology-expert-tech-neck-can-be-avoided-through-better-posture/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'When you're in those positions for a long period of time, the muscles kind of go into a spasm, and then they kind of pinch those nerves, and then you get those wrap-around tension headaches that we tend to see.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Richardson added that posture walking and being more aware of one's posture more generally reduce neck and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Hunched shoulders and a forward head posture put extra stress on the spine. Walking tall with the head aligned above the shoulders encourages spinal alignment, reducing the risk of aches and chronic pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 16 million American adults experience chronic back pain, thanks in part to high rates of inactivity and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translates to lost time at work, expensive trips to physical therapists and fees for exercise classes that require specialist equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, clinical research has shown that walking is beneficial for lower back pain. But walking with the spine aligned is paramount.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several studies have suggested that maintaining an upright posture, particularly while doing stressful tasks, can help decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increase confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30261357/"&gt;Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; reported that&lt;span&gt; walking posture influences the body's response to stress. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers from New Zealand recruited 73 healthy adults and first measured their baseline mood and physiological states. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After a brief walk in their normal posture, participants were randomly assigned to either walk with an upright, confident stride, or walk in a slumped, dejected posture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone was subjected to a psychological stressor while walking to test the power of posture under pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simple act of walking tall created a buffer against stress, the researchers noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychologically, the upright group reported feeling significantly better. They were less negative, less sleepy, experienced less pain, and felt more powerful than their slumped counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 16 million American adults suffer from chronic back pain, with high rates of physical inactivity and obesity being significant contributing factors (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of adults aged 18 and over with any form of pain. Back pain is the most common form of pain in the US, the figures suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The upright walkers also had significantly lower blood pressure and nervous system arousal, suggesting their posture actually helped their bodies manage the stressor more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, good posture engages the core and glutes, helping the body move more smoothly and with less wasted energy, which makes walking more effective for calorie burning and lowers the risk of injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Holding a good posture forces the core muscles to work to keep the body upright. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simply standing up straight instead of slouching &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rumen.com.au/article/improving-posture-weight-loss-scientific-connection/"&gt;can boost metabolism&lt;/a&gt; by five to seven percent. Doing this for just a few extra hours a day can add up to burning an extra 50 to 100 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maintaining good posture can improve the body's ability to take in oxygen, which helps the body burn calories more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With interest spiking online, expect posture walking to become the next wellness buzzword not just in fitness blogs, but across health, workplace wellbeing, and even gut health circles,' Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among its many benefits, mindful walking is a free, foundational human movement that requires no special gear to practice effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent surge in attention is poised to elevate posture walking from a niche practice into a mainstream wellness hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proper posture has long been championed not only by physical therapists and personal trainers, but also spine experts, chiropractors and nutritionists highlighting its role in aiding digestion and relieving pressure on internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting," the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report notes that data is "inadequate" to prove that the insects are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance. But it also says that the bugs are "increasingly recognized" because of frequent encounters with humans and due to more research attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness," it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Chagas disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites found in triatomine or "kissing" bugs, which can pass the disease to other animals and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/chagas-disease-which-can-be-deadly-now-considered-endemic-us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, the insect's nickname comes from the bug often biting people on the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 8 million people globally and 280,000 in the United States have the disease, often without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body," the CDC says, adding bugs pass the parasite in their droppings after biting a person or animal. "If these droppings get into someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease does not spread from person to person like a cold, nor does it spread through casual contact with those infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the acute phase, which happens shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Romaña's sign may appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This happens when the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite gets into the eyelid, usually by accidentally rubbing the bug feces into your eye or into a bug bite near your eye," the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other acute signs may include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may experience symptoms for years or a lifetime, which is known as the chronic phase of infection, and can include heart and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(The disease) can destroy the nerves that feed the various parts of your body — so your heart, your esophagus, your colon," infectious disease physician Tom Moore &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/chagas-disease-kissing-bug-north-delaware-valley-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2019 as cases made their way north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both stages, some people might not feel sick while others can have serious health problems, the CDC adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to avoid kissing bugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease at this time, according to the CDC, so it's important to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention methods include staying in well-built places if traveling, using insecticides and bug spray, wearing clothes that cover your skin and not eating raw fruits and vegetables, as the infection can also be acquired orally or through the mouth via contaminated food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also previously told CBS News Philadelphia that homeowners can seal windows and keep trash, piles of wood and rocks away from their homes to reduce risk. &lt;/p&gt;

In the case of ischemic strokes, the patient may receive a clot-busting drug within a 4.5-hour time frame or undergo mechanical thrombectomy which is a minimally invasive method of removing the clot through a catheter. This procedure can be done up to 24 hours after the stroke in certain cases. For hemorrhagic strokes, surgery such as a craniotomy to clear pooled blood or endovascular coiling/clipping to repair ruptured vessels may be required. &lt;br&gt;Silent strokes might not have the kind of symptoms that seem serious like those associated with a stroke generally, but silently they can add up over time. Research has linked silent strokes to long-term cognitive impacts such as memory lapses, decision-making difficulties, balance problems, and mood swings. Worse still, multiple silent strokes increase the risk of future major strokes and vascular dementia, emphasizing the importance of early detection.&lt;br&gt;Dr. Brij Lal Choudhary, Consultant – Neurology, Manipal Hospital, Jaipur &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 14:40:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在兰开斯特县发现蚊子传播的西尼罗河病毒新病例- LancasterOnline</title><link>https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/new-case-of-mosquito-borne-west-nile-virus-found-in-lancaster-county/article_ee36cb6c-b386-4b58-b8a7-ef08fc6588e7.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;A new Lancaster County case of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus was reported last week, bringing the county’s human case tally to five this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact dates of infection are not available, the state Department of Environmental Protection reported the most recent case in a &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/WNV/2025-09-05-WNV_Activity_by_County.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;weekly report dated Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/4-west-nile-virus-cases-so-far-this-summer-in-lancaster-county/article_3e0bfa94-02f1-4fc5-a255-c26ec38805fc.html" target="_blank"&gt;The other four individuals&lt;/a&gt; were likely infected in July and August, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lancaster County cases account for five of the 25 human cases that have been reported in Pennsylvania this year, according to the report. In 2024, Lancaster County had a total of five reported human cases and two deaths, and in 2023, it had zero, according to state DEP &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/WNV/WNVResultsArchive/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily an illness of birds, West Nile virus was first found in Pennsylvania in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/west-nile-virus" target="_blank"&gt;Pennsylvania Game Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is typically &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_prevention-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;transmitted by infected mosquitos&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other illnesses, it doesn’t commonly spread between people — coughing, sneezing and touch do not transmit West Nile virus, according to the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/php/transmission/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. West Nile cases usually peak in late August to early September, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-fact"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Human cases of West Nile virus in 2025, by county&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adams: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berks: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chester: 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cumberland: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dauphin: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Franklin: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lancaster: 5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lebanon: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perry: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;York: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statewide: 25&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/WNV/2025-09-05-WNV_Activity_by_County.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection weekly report dated Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prevention tips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no licensed vaccines or medications available for West Nile, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; the best way to stay safe is to avoid getting bit. Wearing loose-fitting, long sleeved shirts and pants, using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-registered bug spray with ingredients like DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus and treating clothes and gear with permethrin can help protect you, as can taking steps to control mosquitos, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dep/programs-and-services/integration/vector-management/mosquitoes#accordion-f190f5e8a0-item-4341a84102" target="_blank"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, the state DEP encourages residents to remove standing water, which can turn discarded tires, bird baths, containers and even bottle caps into breeding grounds for mosquitos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who catch West Nile virus will experience no symptoms, while about 20% will feel like they have the flu. Less than 1% will experience a more serious version of the disease affecting the central nervous system, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. This can cause inflammation of the brain and of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. About 10% of those who experience this severe form of the illness will die, and permanent symptoms are possible for those who survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age increases the risk of severe illness from West Nile virus. Adults 65 and older are three times as likely to develop neurologic illness compared with those under 65, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Conditions like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease also put people at higher risk of severe illness, as do weakened immune systems, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-fact"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;West Nile Virus symptoms&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 80% of people who get West Nile virus will feel fine, but others will experience symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. Symptoms typically begin two to six days after infection, but sometimes take as long as 14 days to begin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of mild illness:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue and weakness lasting for weeks or months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In less than 1% of cases, the virus infects the central nervous system, which can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Severe central nervous system illness causes death in about 10% of cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of severe illness:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neck stiffness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stupor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disorientation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tremors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convulsions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paralysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;
