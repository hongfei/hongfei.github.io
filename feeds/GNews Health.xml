Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are "ghosts in the system", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a "deep low". "I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on," she says. "They said my symptoms weren't that serious." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are "undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which makes their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated £9.6bn a year. That equates to more than £300 per taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&amp;amp;E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Highly treatable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This nearly £10bn figure is actually quite conservative," says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work and claiming benefits in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: "If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCP and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is "completely treatable" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut "the cost to society" as well as reducing "the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: "Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was utterly delusional," she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&amp;amp;E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was failed," she says. "I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs – energetic, grandiose language, erratic – but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Costs could be halved &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with "less florid manic episodes" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a high threshold of referral," Prof Chew Graham says. "People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a tragedy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand – this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If anything in this article makes you concerned please consult your GP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="if-you've-been-affected-by-the-issues-in-this-story,-help-and-support-is-available-via" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-action-line." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;BBC Action Line.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 01:18:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9IdWd3ajQ4SHhobHNzNGVKTF8tUGNia2FWRTJTZzR3MWpiZlVEbnRPdUd0OXFkRE14MHQ3blRJM3hWcXBMTGgwWGdPU1VGeTFVVU1xVjhBaEFHUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5pRjF4WnNFSkI4akpJQWFvSGpoYmloRWticzlfamFiS2UxV3l4MS1WTGdXSl93bmg0STh2N0xLdU5oaXNHZ0E1S0FMSnd1XzlFdFVLb3UwSDExNmlqazNj</guid></item><item><title>SS strikes again - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9KNjNmUzFCaVk0bUtPLUlhcE55NXlsT1JrbFptb2dvOW1zNldXdGFsWTlLNlBKUGRraTFVUmRFTHJaTFpBVnN2N2JaeEVfd2JzREpZZlBVQ2JmeDFOSkhiR1pDT01rLWFOR3hDM1hzdFJfOVdjUlVr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;My adult daughter gets a whopping $889 a month for SSD. She had to claim disability before ever being able to hold down a job after getting her Masters degree, in European Policies at Bath University, UK. She has a B.S. degree in Poly Sci and Spanish. She wanted to work in Europe at the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter’s SSD diagnosis: OCD at 9 years old. Crohn’s disease (25” removed). Gastroparesis — paralyzed stomach. Those two did not allow her to work and we filed for SSD when she was 22. To get her approved at age 22 for SSD it took two years. Two denials and us hiring a lawyer. A judge finally approved her for SSD and she got a little over $700 to live on. She didn’t qualify for food stamps, etc. due to us making too much money at the time of filing and her living with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added diagnosis at later times: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" target="_blank" title=""&gt;POTS&lt;/a&gt; — Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Sinus Tachycardia. hypermobile Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome (hEDS); a connective tissue disorder. We think the hEDS skipped a generation or two to get to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder that causes generalized joint hypermobility, joint instability, and chronic pain. hEDS is also associated with a variety of other symptoms and related conditions that affect many different areas of the body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many with hEDS are wheel chair bound but we are lucky that she is mobile and doesn’t need me to care for her in any way — yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cannot have over $1500 at any time in her bank account or she’s fined. In &lt;strong&gt;May, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, hubby forgot to pull out some of the funds so that the automatic deposit wouldn’t go over the $1500. Oooops. SS deposited her $860 and for two days she had over $1500 in her account by $27.00. She got a letter in July, 2024 stating that due to being over the amount in her account in May, she would have a deduction for those two months of over $100 from her next couple of SSD payments, to balance out the account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s allowed one car. She sold the one she had and got an EV. (We’re trying to do our part here folks.) SS saw TWO CARS on her account. She had to call twice and give lots of documentation that &lt;u&gt;THEIR deposit&lt;/u&gt; caused the overage and she only had one car. Resolved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every five years she has to prove that she &lt;em&gt;continues to be disabled&lt;/em&gt;. One time, one asshole said she could use her arms so could work. She filed a complaint and, literally, 15 minutes before us driving an hour and a half to the main SS office in Modesto for the appointment, the agent there called and said he approved her SSD. The ups and downs this causes can be very difficult for her to deal with. She will be 40 years old this year and each year we watch her body slowly, very slowly, deteriorate. Many people with an episode with hEDS (she has had one with the sinus tachycardia) has a life expectancy of 45. We shall see.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 74 year old husband is lucky to be able to work part-time, temporary for the City he worked with before. I also work full-time at 73 years old, as a professional long-arm quilter. We still get out PERS through our previous jobs and our social security by not overworking. We have worked hard for our SS and continue to work hard to support our daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay an extra $1800 a month for insurance for our daughter due to her seeing specialists at Stanford. We still pay cash to other medical folks that help her. Counseling, physical therapy, etc. We lay out between $3 — $4000 a month to care of her (car, medical, food, etc.) Due to her hEDS, she had no connective tissue in her left jaw and had to have major jaw surgery. We paid $67,000 out of pocket due to insurance saying it was elective! The misaligned jaw caused migraine headaches, face, jaw, shoulder, neck pain. Plus it had to be done to help her chew FFS. But insurance kept saying it was plastic surgery and elective. Insurance paid for anesthesia, hospital though. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can people perpetrate fraud in Social Security? Within two days they know if our daughter has over $1500 in her account! Then…..deduct funds after that until it’s “balanced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just got a new letter today. Is it a form letter all SSD folks are getting? It states that she was notified “before” that there was an issue with her account and she was going to be discounted $121 a month. Not why? Not how long? Nothing. There was no notification before except last year and that was resolved. She will be contacting our local SS office, which for now, is still open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this part of the changes Musk is trying to put through? It’s already hard enough to get SSD for the small amount of support it affords our daughter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our current situation. The fight to get what we have paid for through our own hard work can sometimes be overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, we are all going to be impacted by this administration, negatively, in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study from Iraq and Iran found that &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a63785578/are-chia-seeds-really-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as possibly help prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But this connection between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6994964/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; and health is nothing new: These small-but-mighty seeds have long been touted for their nutritional benefits. One ounce (about 2 tablespoons) of chia seeds contains nearly 10 grams fiber and 5 grams protein, plus &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64303162/study-omega3-fatty-acids-biolgical-age/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't really tried this superfood, now is the time to change that! This ingredient is easy to incorporate into recipes — and a little packs a big nutritional punch. That said, there are a few things to know before you start stirring this seed into anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the experts in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen and Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition Labs share their top tips for using these seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small, oval-shaped seeds come from the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica &lt;/em&gt;plant, a member of the mint family. Native to Central and South America, these seeds have been cultivated for centuries and today can be found pretty much anywhere in the United States (Trader Joe's, Aldi, Amazon, you name it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chia seeds nutrition (1 ounce, dry), &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per the;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;per the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;140 calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9g total fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12g total carbohydrates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10g dietary fiber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5g protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when soaked, chia seeds absorb liquid and turn into a gel-like consistency. This will affect the texture of whatever you're stirring chia seeds into — whether that be smoothies, puddings, homemade jams or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir it into oatmeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because such a small amount packs such a nutritional punch, adding a spoonful of chia seeds into something you &lt;em&gt;already &lt;/em&gt;eat on the regular — like oatmeal — is a no-brainer. Food producer &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/254692/tina-martinez/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tina Martinez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tina Martinez&lt;/a&gt; always stirs 1 tablespoon of chia seeds into her oatmeal before heating in the microwave. “I love the consistency of just having some chia seeds, but not all chia seeds (as is the case of a chia pudding)." Not a fan of hot oatmeal? You can also mix chia seeds into overnight oats as you meal prep a few jars to stash in the fridge for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Make a chia pudding&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't talk about what to do with chia seeds without bringing up chia pudding. "Chia pudding is so thick and creamy because of the way the seeds interact and plump up when combined with liquid," explains Chief Food Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/11320/kate-merker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kate Merker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kate Merker&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on what else you add to the equation, this dish can be enjoyed as a breakfast, snack or fun dessert. No matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat it, know it'll probably help you stay satiated. "I had chia pudding while I was traveling, and it kept me full, so now I make it at home," says Kitchen Appliances Lab Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/223025/nicole-papantoniou/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicole Papantoniou;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicole Papantoniou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend into smoothies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papantoniou also recommends adding some chia seeds to your smoothie. "Don't add too many, though, because the seeds can change the texture and make the drink jiggly," she warns. You should be good with adding just a tablespoon to your favorite smoothie recipe to start. That's the amount we used in our &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/a38684144/make-ahead-smoothies-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a jam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where chia seeds' ability to absorb liquid and plump up &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;comes into play in the best way possible. Combining chia seeds with muddled berries and maple syrup results in a naturally thickened (quick!) jam — no need for additional pectin or gelatin. "I'll use it when I'm cooking down just plain frozen fruit for a jam," says Deputy Editor &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/226537/sarah-wharton/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Gregory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Gregory&lt;/a&gt;. She then will spread the jam on toast, stir into oatmeal or even layer into a breakfast oat bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Boost your energy bites&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you usually DIY these nutrient-dense snacks to stash in your fridge or freezer, stir some chia seeds into your next batch. Nutrition Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/224673/stefani-sassos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., NASM-CPT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., NASM-CPT&lt;/a&gt; always adds chia seeds to her energy bites.

They will contribute crunch to whatever you sprinkle 'em on. That can include yogurt or smoothie bowls, with a handful of granola, as well as salads. Papantoniou loves to sprinkle some on top of bananas with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should you store chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the recommendation is to store chia seeds in a cool, dark place (read: your pantry), only half of the food team stores them there. The other half keeps theirs in the freezer, which can help prolong their shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;many chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. "Chia seeds are little nutritional powerhouses, but you can get too much of a good thing. Eating them in large amounts may lead to digestive distress since they are very high in fiber," says Sassos. Be sure to drink plenty of water to help the fiber properly digest, and introduce them gradually into your diet. This really applies to any high-fiber food, since you need to allow your digestive system some time to adjust to the higher fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9mS0RlTlZHREt3OFNhX3BYU0tEVkNaT2hoeUxrc0NmYm8zRU5NT3d6NndoWXBOM1FEOW9BTXZMQ01IRjFuX0U3TEF6M1VwWno4emI5ejAxTmJFb2JQSTF5ekJSdTdveUk</guid></item><item><title>This Woman Had No Idea She Had A Life-Threatening Health Issue Until A Preventative MRI Screening - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPazlaZzc3ZENPX1ZuRzBZdjZ4bkdfOWZLbG83SmduVVVKUGJsS3JyaUl2R1V0VGg0RjZNU3BtR3RtMUltdThaS1B0cXowNDFWSkRvRTJwNk1vd0hWckZIazd2bXpMenMwN0tsZmdpZ2VoREgxVnNBTnk0by11MTAyNnh5anUxMVlCOWFRUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance. However, Prenuvo &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/pricing" target="_blank"&gt;said on its website&lt;/a&gt; some people "have been able to get full or partial reimbursement." Prices can range anywhere from $999 for a Torso Scan to $2,499 for a Whole Body Scan to $4,499 for an Enhanced Screening in New York City (some of the prices are dependent on location).&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, MRIs can cost, on average, $400 to $12,000, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/diagnostics/how-much-does-an-mri-cost" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to GoodRx. Some portion of MRIs could be covered by insurance, but that depends on the type of insurance, whether or not the MRI provider is in or out-of-network, if there are additional medications needed with the procedure, and if it's considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Then she shook her head and added, "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah received her results four days later. "The only issue with how I got the results is that they came at 8:30 p.m., and I had nobody to call," she said.

You may need to take preventive antibiotics or get additional vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So yeah. That is how my health anxiety started," Sarah continued. "It was a really dark and hard two months where I was spiraling and freaking out and seeing a lot of doctors, and pretty much treating my body like glass because I had no idea about this, and literally felt like a ticking time bomb was found inside my body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah later got a CT scan and discovered there were actually not one, but &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; splenic aneurysms inside her splenic artery. "So, anyways...now I am getting my spleen removed, and I will be starting the journey of living life without a spleen, which I think is going to be okay and it's going to be better than having to live in fear of having a ruptured aneurysm — but not what I was expecting," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah said friends have asked her whether she regrets getting the scan or not. "It changes often," she said. "But I feel grateful. I'm happy that I know about this and had the chance to decide what I wanted to do moving forward. But I've also had people say, 'Oh, I have health anxiety, I want to go do this.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For the people that already have existing health anxiety, I truly don't know if I can recommend it because I was just like a normal anxious girlie before this, and now, I'm a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I'm trying to overcome," she continued. "But I will say, I'm pretty proud of myself for the way that I overcame this. And...yeah. Two months ago was a very different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some commenters in the medical field told Sarah just how lucky she was to have found this condition early. "My jaw dropped reading splenic aneurysm. I've only experienced 3 patients come in the ED [Emergency Department] with a ruptured aneurysm and all three didn't make it," said one commenter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "Provider here. Count your lucky stars-you definitely have a reason to still be here! I know it's terrifying, but you just dodged an untimely death!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others had lost loved ones to ruptured splenic aneurysms and told Sarah they felt she was lucky, too. One said, "My brother in law just died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He was 39 and extremely healthy. You are so so lucky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another shared, "One of my best friends passed away from a splenic aneurysm. She was about 37 weeks pregnant &amp;amp; also lost the baby. Getting that scan done is a blessing in disguise whether you realize it or not!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unsurprisingly, commenters also mentioned they wished that insurance would cover the scans. "I hope one day this can be covered by insurance (or better yet covered by free healthcare) so that everyone can have preventative care," someone said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "I don't understand why every insurance cannot provide 1 full body scan to every person. Just once a year. ... It would be so amazing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, "Our insurance should cover regular scans," said another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance.

&lt;p&gt;The health department is investigating after an active tuberculosis case was identified at a Waukegan High School campus, which is prompting enhanced cleaning and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 Superintendent Theresa Plascencia sent a letter to part of the Waukegan High School Brookside campus about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plascencia said an &lt;span&gt;active tuberculosis case has been identified within the Brookside campus school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The district said they are working closely with the Lake County Health Department to follow all recommended protocols to “ensure the safety and well-being” of students and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff identified as close contacts have already been notified with recommended actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To respect their privacy, we will not be sharing any additional details,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high school is undergoing recommended cleaning procedures as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School operations continued as usual on Monday with continued cleaning and COVID-era air filtration enhancements in place, Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;is spread through the air from one person to another. The disease germs are emitted into the air when a person with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks or sings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease are most likely to spread &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;germs to people they spend time with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;can make a person very ill, Plascencia said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If not treated, it can lead to serious health complications. Only people with active TB disease can spread the germ to others. Those with ‘latent’ TB have the germ in the body but cannot spread it to others. Both active and latent TB are treatable,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who experiences symptoms associated with tuberculosis, such as a persistent cough lasting three weeks or longer, coughing up blood, pain with breathing or coughing, chest pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, fever, chills or night sweats, is asked to contact their healthcare provider or the Lake County Health Department &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;clinic at 847-377-8700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district is hosting a virtual town hall at 6 p.m. on Tuesday with the Lake County Health Department to answer questions students and parents have.&lt;/p&gt;

The study found that people with higher PTSD symptoms were more likely to fear strong emotions, which led to less constructive and more conflict-driven communication styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These emotional fears contribute to patterns like demand-withdraw behavior, where one partner pressures and the other retreats, reinforcing both relationship strain and PTSD symptoms.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected data from 64 opposite-sex couples in which both members of the couple had experienced a traumatic life event. The researchers analyzed PTSD symptom data from each member of the couple about perceived negative consequences if they feel strong emotions and how they and their partner tend to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results published in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that people with higher levels of PTSD symptoms experienced greater fear of their emotions, which was associated with less constructive communication and more unproductive communication with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we were trying to understand why people with PTSD symptoms have trouble resolving relationship difficulties with their romantic partners,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, people with PTSD view themselves and other people negatively, and the resulting mistrust, anger, avoidance, withdrawal and emotional numbing put strain on their romantic relationships. Experiencing your feelings, trusting people and connecting with others are all important ingredients for healing from PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD can create a vicious cycle, according to Fredman. Behavior triggered by PTSD symptoms such as aggression, avoidance, withdrawal and numbing may strain relationships, and relationship discord can maintain PTSD symptoms. This cycle continues unless something changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fredman co-developed couple-based treatment for PTSD to disrupt this cycle. Individuals with PTSD often experience emotions as dangerous and a trigger — or a trauma reminder — because strong emotions were felt during or after their trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since romantic relationships evoke many strong emotions, people may experience emotionally evocative interactions with their partners as threatening and can engage in behaviors to neutralize this perceived threat, such as becoming aggressive and/or withdrawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one or both partners develop unhealthy coping skills, strained romantic relationships can reinforce the symptoms of PTSD. On the other hand, relationships in which people can both express themselves and listen can promote recovery from PTSD, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers recruited people with a broad range of PTSD symptoms and symptom severity. Studying people with a broad range of severity allowed the research team to understand the ways that more or less severe symptoms were likely to affect communication in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers interviewed participants about their PTSD symptoms and asked participants whether they feared their emotions. They also asked whether they typically communicate constructively — which involves collaborative problem solving, listening, suggesting compromises and expressing one’s feelings; whether they demand while their partner withdraws; and whether their partner demands while they withdraw when relationship issues arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In demand/withdraw communication, one partner complains, nags or otherwise tries to demand a response from their partner. The other partner responds by withdrawing and avoiding the interaction. Typically, Fredman said, the more one person withdraws, the more the other partner demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of communication does not facilitate problem solving and often leaves issues unresolved. Unproductive and unresolved conflict can maintain PTSD symptoms by reinforcing perceptions of interpersonal threat and negative views of oneself and the other partner, Fredman continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms were more likely to report fear of their emotions. Additionally, those who reported greater fear of their emotions were less likely to report constructive communication and were more likely to report that they demand while their partner withdraws and that their partner demands while they withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to identify that fear of emotions has interpersonal consequences, according to Fredman, meaning the fear influences how people interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we only looked at PTSD symptoms and communication without considering a person’s fear of their emotions, there were relatively few direct connections we could identify,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at the connections between PTSD symptoms and fear of emotions and then examined the connections between fear of emotions and communication styles, the connections became clear. This suggests that fear of emotions is an important influence on the communication style of couples where one or both people have PTSD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior work by Fredman and colleagues demonstrated that individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms had difficulties regulating their own emotional arousal during laboratory-based conversations with their partners about their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, they responded to their own emotional arousal and the emotional arousal communicated through their partner’s voice in a manner consistent with emotional arousal serving as a trauma cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study extended this prior work by demonstrating that individuals’ PTSD symptoms may predispose them to catastrophic thoughts about feeling strong emotions and that such thoughts may be why couples in which one or both partners have elevated PTSD symptoms tend to have a hard time communicating constructively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other research we conducted has shown that couple therapy can effectively reduce PTSD symptoms and improve relationship communication, even in just a single weekend,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This latest study reveals more nuance about how PTSD symptoms, fear of emotions and communication difficulties are connected and why they should be treated at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeesun Lee, graduate student in human development and family studies at Penn State; Yunying Le, who earned her doctorate in human development and family studies in 2019 and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State and is now research assistant professor at University of Denver; Emily Taverna, who earned her doctorate in 2023 psychology at Penn State and is now Advanced Fellow in Women’s Health at the Women’s Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD; and Amy Marshall, professor at Virginia Tech, also contributed to this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The National Center for Advancing Translational Science, the Karl R.

Using sleep studies and brain imaging data from 270 participants, researchers found that poor sleep architecture was linked to brain atrophy over time—particularly in the inferior parietal region, an area affected early in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after accounting for factors like age, heart health, and lifestyle habits.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were adjusted for potential confounders including demographic characteristics, smoking history, alcohol use, hypertension, and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide preliminary evidence that reduced neuroactivity during sleep may contribute to brain atrophy, thereby potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” said lead author Gawon Cho, who has a doctorate in public health and is a postdoctoral associate at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are particularly significant because they help characterize how sleep deficiency, a prevalent disturbance among middle-aged and older adults, may relate to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published March 31 as an accepted paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia. An estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and this number is projected to double by 2060, pending medical developments to prevent, slow or cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved an analysis of data from 270 participants who had a median age of 61 years. Fifty-three percent were female, and all participants were white. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they previously had a stroke or probable dementia or other significant brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research utilized polysomnography to assess baseline sleep architecture. Advanced brain imaging techniques were used to measure brain volumes 13 to 17 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, the study demonstrates an important association between sleep and long-term brain health, and it highlights potential opportunities to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, posing the opportunity to explore interventions to reduce risk or delay Alzheimer’s onset,” said Cho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that further investigation is needed to fully understand the causal relationships between sleep architecture and Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8be6eeefe2eacbeaeaf8e6a5e4f9ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Heffron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Heffron – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.11630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions&lt;/a&gt;” by Gawon Cho et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e188"&gt;Study Objectives:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deficiency is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. We examined the association of sleep architecture with anatomical features observed in AD: (1) atrophy of hippocampus, entorhinal, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (“AD-vulnerable regions”) and (2) cerebral microbleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e195"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 270 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study, we examined the association of baseline sleep architecture with anatomical features identified on brain MRI 13∼17 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep architecture was quantified as the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS), proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and arousals index using polysomnography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes included (1) volumetric measurements of each AD-vulnerable region and (2) the presence of any cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and that of lobar CMBs, which are more specifically associated with AD. We analyzed the association of each sleep predictor with each MRI outcome, adjusting for covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e202"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Median age was 61, 53% female, 100% were White, and 47% had 16+ years of education. Mmedian times in SWS and REM were 17.4% and 21.5%, respectively. Having less SWS was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-44.18 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per -1 percentage point [PP] of SWS, [95%CI=-76.62, -11.74]) and cuneus (β=-11.98 [=-20.92, -3.04] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per -1 PP of SWS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having less REM was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-75.54 [-129.36, -21.72] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per 1 PP of REM) and precuneus (β=-31.92 [-63.78,-0.06] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per 1 PP of REM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After FDR adjustments, lower SWS and REM were associated with significantly smaller inferior parietal region volumes. Arousal index was not associated with the volumes of AD-vulnerable regions. None of the sleep architecture variables were associated with CMBs or lobar CMBs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e218"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deficiency is associated with the atrophy of the inferior parietal region, which is observed in early AD. Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for AD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:07:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE44RmFOV3hQd2l4emcySktJLXN0cVQzX0dwTkl6TnJVdVFwSjl6aXhlWEZDN0VVc0xTS3M0eTNFY1FhZEdNWDcwQkx3b0FldC1WNEs0aS1kajhUR2JsZXE3RFZwdG5OSmhF</guid></item><item><title>Woman, 35, With Tongue Cancer Goes Viral for TikTok 'Fit Checks' - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNS2xLYS1JS3hfNzVfSzNXZVdfbUlVaGsyY0dCLUFfWHM1ZWh1TE9qN1dhYkExd2JtVy1jUThHd1BDeU1hMlZPSmtTWVhaRFdyZWtnWEpyYm1YMlZmaHREczFYUERnY2syOGpNUHE4RjBXcDBzMEduQ1VGVktCcDgxSkh5RXFuYVXSAVRBVV95cUxOU0RFd2RGeERHVUxjOXExS1htYVZEV2pxNzVPdE1EcXcxOThLOVYzc2VBbkVOcF9lZlVQRWl6eGhlc0x4MmRlbFh5djBLakZhWHU3SnI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of 2023, Beth Riehle experienced a terrible migraine that “just seemed to never go away,” she recalls.

(She struggles to speak for long periods due to her treatment.) “I had general tiredness.”Riehle visited her primary care doctor and a dentist to understand why she was experiencing such terrible pain. Finally, an ear, nose and throat doctor biopsied her tongue and figured out what caused her headaches — Stage 4 tongue cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t until I saw a specialist that I found out what I was facing,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Headaches and tongue discoloration &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the headaches started, Riehle visited her medical providers. She first saw her dentist.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She noticed some discoloration on my tongue but never discussed what it might be,” she says. “My primary care physician also examined me when I came in for my original complaints but also never alluded to any major problems.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she met with her primary care physician, they suggested that she visit an otolaryngologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He thought maybe the pains were symptoms of my TMJ,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;TMJ, the temporomandibular joint that connects the jaw to the skull, can cause disorders that can lead to pain in the face, head, jaw and ears, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tmj/symptoms-causes/syc-20350941" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But when the ENT doctor examined Riehle, they noticed something unusual on her tongue and instead performed a punch biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In March 2024, the results of the biopsy returned, and Riehle learned she had Stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma in her tongue. The diagnosis felt devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It (feels) extremely lonely having a cancer most people my age don’t get,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors provided her with two treatment options — surgery that would remove her tongue, or radiation and chemotherapy. She opted for the latter. Riehle started with radiation five days a week with weekly chemotherapy. Two months after finishing treatment, she experienced a new symptom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I started having terrible shooting pains across my forehead and neck,” she says. “I assumed they were delayed reactions to the radiation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg" alt="Beth Riehle tongue cancer"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for Stage 4 tongue cancer, Beth Riehle thought she was cancer free. Sadly, two months later doctors found a new tumor, which was a recurrence of her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Beth Riehle &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In September 2024, she visited an emergency room and doctors admitted her to the hospital. She also underwent a CT scan to check that the cancer was gone. Days later, doctors shared some more upsetting news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They told me my cancer was ‘treatment resistant,’” Riehle says. “I had a recurrence and a second tumor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle began treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Doctors recommended that she undergo the surgery to remove the tumor and most of her tongue, a procedure that’s called a glossectomy. She felt worried about the surgery and what life after would be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Doctors told me I’d have a 50/50 chance of speaking again,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same day that she learned she needed surgery, her fiancé, Donald, proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He made what was the worst day of my life also one of the most memorable,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Tongue cancer in young women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tongue cancer has long been associated with older men who smoke, chew tobacco and drink alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is unusual for someone who’s young, less than 40 years of age without the traditional risk factors to develop a tongue cancer like this,” Dr. Karen Choi, a head and neck surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center and one of Riehle’s doctors, tells TODAY.com. “Although oral cavity cancer typically affects the older male population, we are actually seeing a rise of this type of cancer in young patients.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More people under 45, especially woman, are being diagnosed with tongue cancer, and experts are unsure why. The type of cancer Riehle has is not associated with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393" target="_blank"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These patients don’t necessarily have those risk factors that we associate with that type of cancer,” Choi says. “We don’t really know what that is. We just know the incidence has been increasing over the last several decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Choi adds that knowing the signs of tongue cancer and seeking care can lead to an earlier diagnosis. Symptoms of tongue cancer include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ulcer that lasts more than two weeks  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in the same spot when eating and drinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ulcer that bleeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many people visit a dentist first. If the dentist rules out dental problems and the symptoms persist, Choi says to follow up with your primary care doctor, who can make a referral to an ENT or oral surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment for tongue cancer can include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. The earlier the cancer is found, the better the outlook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg" alt="Beth Riehle tongue cancer"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Beth Riehle has undergo radiation, chemotherapy and surgery to treat her Stage 4 tongue cancer.

Doctors removed 80% of her tongue and 75 lymph nodes from her neck and created a “flap” in her mouth, using some of a muscle from her leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to surgery, she had a feeding tube placed because eating was too painful from so much radiation to her head and neck. During surgery, doctors also gave her a tracheotomy to help her breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s so much swelling ... in the back of the throat. Putting a tracheotomy tube allows us to bypass that swelling so she can breathe comfortably,” Choi explains. “Once the swelling resolves and goes down enough that it’s not blocking off the airway from the mouth and nose pathway, the trach can be removed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle remembers "doing so well after surgery. It was the first time I had been cancer-free in almost a year, so my body was really receptive to recovery," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But the additional 30 radiation sessions and living without her full tongue have taken a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Riehle felt pleasantly surprised the first time she spoke after surgery, she struggles to open her mouth due to tightness in her jaw muscles, a condition called trismus, common in people being treated for head and neck cancers, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24086-trismus" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I have mouth sores and mucositis, which is when you overproduce thick secretions. It’s difficult to swallow and talk,” she adds. “I’m exhausted, if I’m being honest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle also attends speech therapy to improve her ability swallow, speak and open her mouth. Her goal one day is to be able to put a prosthetic in her mouth to make her speech clearer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(Your tongue) is such an integral part of life — food, air communication,” she says. “I’ve had to re-learn how to do just about everything your mouth functions for.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She feels pleased to learn that, despite the pain and uncertainty of what’s she’s been through in the past year, she’s still herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’ve learned that given the circumstances, I can still manage to laugh and make others laugh,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As part of her recovery, Riehle began posting “fit checks” on social media.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I wanted to use &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isthisriehlelife" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to track my progress as far as my speech,” she says. “I also thought that by putting my experience out there, I might be able to help someone else my age or someone going through my experience in the way I wished for when I was first diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of February, Riehle finished radiation and had her trach removed. Sometimes, she marvels at what she's been through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I never in a million years thought I would be strong enough,” she says. “There’s a deep sense of bravery and the ability to overcome the adversity inside us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle found a group called &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/rise-tongue-cancer-young-women-rcna96249?search=Young%20Tongues" target="_blank"&gt;Young Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, which offers support to young people with tongue cancer, and she’s received encouragement after going viral on social media. Finding community helps and motivates her to share her story to be there for others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I’ve had people who have undergone the same surgery as me find me and show appreciation for giving a voice to a group of people who aren’t necessarily represented,” she says. “It’s been a powerful experience and an important reminder of vulnerability’s place in our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:05:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNS2xLYS1JS3hfNzVfSzNXZVdfbUlVaGsyY0dCLUFfWHM1ZWh1TE9qN1dhYkExd2JtVy1jUThHd1BDeU1hMlZPSmtTWVhaRFdyZWtnWEpyYm1YMlZmaHREczFYUERnY2syOGpNUHE4RjBXcDBzMEduQ1VGVktCcDgxSkh5RXFuYVXSAVRBVV95cUxOU0RFd2RGeERHVUxjOXExS1htYVZEV2pxNzVPdE1EcXcxOThLOVYzc2VBbkVOcF9lZlVQRWl6eGhlc0x4MmRlbFh5djBLakZhWHU3SnI</guid></item><item><title>What to know about vitamin A's toxic risks after RFK Jr. promotes it for measles - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcmwtbWg3NUVocmdWaF92SC1MU0RoaURBUHdVVWVCUE1qbXVqekdtVldXWmJoX25KZVpiUERLLVFJUTlJcnRQemhxT1pEczFmbFZzaVEyaGFtRG01NzNGX3JpLXR6RHd4eVBXOVEwVFh5RUlyQmtiMUZjOVRPN1hRUUNNeFlIVlVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:02:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcmwtbWg3NUVocmdWaF92SC1MU0RoaURBUHdVVWVCUE1qbXVqekdtVldXWmJoX25KZVpiUERLLVFJUTlJcnRQemhxT1pEczFmbFZzaVEyaGFtRG01NzNGX3JpLXR6RHd4eVBXOVEwVFh5RUlyQmtiMUZjOVRPN1hRUUNNeFlIVlVY</guid></item><item><title>I'm a doctor... and your sleeping position reveals a lot about your health - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQSzRJdE1WeUZiN3E1RnhtS0lLMnZ1dUFFd3M0V0lUTmt0aERlLTE5RHZETi1sZWFtWTRpdEVTeVdvRVYxbmhudTBLRGVWZEJqVUtVbUpUY0NSTE00dG1pa2ZEenZsRnNKRzdoTnpHaFJHSUNrUHFIN3B0WVpBcEJZcXFmOHVaQy02cVhtY28za1JMeUU3cjZ0MWlUWVhGNXhha3JIdG80SjfSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUloNmVWY1J4MkVWbnNWQTU0eFpPY1Rhd21NTFhVYUYxZ0MyYzhXNHZ6YlM0YURaQ19ibjdOc0Q1cGRqLTJUZEx5RFpBWjZzZmxDUlNfck1qajdPNThOZUFrYWk0dzBzRGJFWnRSWTdfSnpFNFNjNHQ3NURBVjRLYV8wa04temd2d1ZRcF9UZTZrYUVudXdQUl9ZZUxaNktuZk84cTktTVQyT1dqem9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A professional psychologist has revealed the five most common sleeping positions that suggest you may be under high stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kyle Osbourne, a clinical psychologist at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Philadelphia, said &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14495773/why-waking-middle-night-diet-stress.html"&gt;stress and sleep quality are closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, with stress impacting sleep and poor sleep exacerbating stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you are under stress, your body releases cortisol, a critical hormone in managing your body’s reaction to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to controlling our sleep-wake cycle, cortisol helps us regulate our metabolism and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol levels or chronic stress can disrupt these processes, leading to inflammation, chronic pain, anxiety, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-9c1ab490-0e4a-11f0-b85f-af5a12500c95" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and even the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This link between sleep and stress can also interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps your body sleep properly. Low amounts of melatonin can lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts note that the sleeping on your side is the best position but when under stress, you may contort yourself into positions such as the Flamingo or Mountain Climber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the common sleeping positions Dr Osbourne says are clear indicators of the body and mind being in stress: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This link between sleep and stress can also interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps your body sleep properly and lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Mummy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to a mummy in a burial shroud, this style refers to lying flat on the back with the legs extended straight out and the arms crossed over the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the mummy style of sleeping can help reduce snoring, sleep apnea and improve spinal alignment, sleeping stiffly with your arms crossed over your chest can also indicate you're feeling anxious, defensive or frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your arm position may also show a yearning for comfort or a subconscious attempt to protect oneself, potentially suggesting underlying stress or anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Tree-Climber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the spread-out position, the tree-climber involves lying on your stomach with your arms extended up at 90 degrees and one of your legs pulled upward also at 90 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At times, underlying stress can cause muscle tension, making it difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position and forcing a person to resort to sleeping on their stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this can worsen previous health conditions such as snoring, sleep apnea aggravation, back or neck pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kyle Osbourne, a clinical psychologist at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, Philadelphia, recently noted that stress and sleep quality are closely linked, with stress impacting sleep and poor sleep exacerbating stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist explained to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201903/your-sleep-position-affects-much-more-than-you-think#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20downsides%20of,lead%20to%20less%20restful%20sleep."&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'Stomach sleeping can be hard on your back and neck, causing additional pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's because when you're stretched out on your stomach, it's practically impossible to keep your spine and neck aligned and not under pressure. Your neck is turned at a 90-degree angle from the rest of your body and elevated by your pillow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a recipe for neck pain and strain. Sleeping on your stomach causes a pronounced curve in your spine - it's sort of like sleeping in a back bend all night - which puts pressure on your lower back and can cause pain and stiffness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stomach sleeping also pushes your face into your pillow, which can lead to more wrinkles and signs of aging.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, sleeping with your arms at angle that leaves them above your head can lead to numbness or tingling in your hands or arms due to pressure on nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Pillow Stacker &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While having all your favorite pillows under your neck may give you comfort and help your acid reflux, it can cause stress, fatigue and mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifting your head too much or using too many pillows can lead to neck ache, which can affect sleep quality and cause discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor night's sleep increases fatigue and a lack of energy, which can cause irritability and affect your mental health in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a prolonged lack of sleep can also lead to a range of health issues, including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease as well as impaired immune function and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that sleeping with just one pillow is best as it raises the head only slightly so that both the head and neck are aligned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of 2025, about 70 percent of Americans say they usually sleep on their sides, 19 percent on their backs and 12 percent on their stomachs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Fetal position&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The baby, or fetal sleep position, is where a person sleeps on their side with their legs curled up and their arms either hugged around them or kept close to the chest - mimicking the position of a fetus in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the posture can improve blood circulation, it may indicate sensitivity and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When faced with extreme stress, our bodies naturally resort to the 'self-soothing' fetal position, much like an infant would - suggesting that person may be unconsciously  self-soothing themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wellandgood.com/lifestyle/what-does-your-sleeping-position-mean-mental-health"&gt; Dr Aarti Grover&lt;/a&gt;, Medical Director for the Center for Sleep at Tufts Medical Center: 'Sleeping in the fetal position has been associated with people who have anxiety and need comfort.' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the position can also cause knee pain as the ligaments around the knees and hips become inflamed due to the constant flexion occurring at those joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol levels or chronic stress can disrupt these processes, leading to inflammation, chronic pain, anxiety, depression and even the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Flamingo &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This sleeping position is when a person sleeps on their back with one leg bent and pulled towards the body while the other remains straight - how a flamingo sleeps in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While some people find this position comfortable and relaxing as it can help with spinal alignment and reduce pressure on certain areas, others believe it is a sign of heightened stress or nervous system activity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from this, sleeping on your back can potentially lead to snoring and sleep apnea. At times, it may also cause acid reflux. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Lois Krahn, a Mayo Clinic sleep specialist explained: 'I know many people find it to be comfortable, because they're not putting weight on their joints. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Sleeping on the back means that your tongue and jaw can fall down and crowd your airway. And many people snore more on their back.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms initially resemble the flu (fever, headache, weakness) but progress to neurological issues such as confusion, hallucinations, paralysis, hydrophobia (fear of water), and eventually coma and death. Fewer than 20 people have ever survived rabies after symptoms presented, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Around 10 people die from rabies in the U.S. each year, the CDC estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of U.S. rabies cases are a result of exposure to bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes.

In a statement, the CDC said that the organ donor was exposed to rabies from a wild animal in Idaho five weeks before they died and their organ was transplanted, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/michigan-resident-dies-rabies-after-undergoing-organ-transplant/story?id=120217114" target="_blank" data-url="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/michigan-resident-dies-rabies-after-undergoing-organ-transplant/story?id=120217114" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABC News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The donor had not died with "traditional rabies symptoms," and they had not sought out medical help or notified public health officials after their exposure to the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an animal bite, rabies can be prevented with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

The vaccine helps the immune system produce antibodies against the rabies virus.

Brain volume decreases, for example, and neural connections may weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGD7BX4SZELPNI7QBW2IVUU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These physical changes help explain the mental shifts that often come with aging, making it harder to recall a word or learn a new task. The risk of developing dementia — an umbrella term that includes Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and more — rises with age, too. But there are simple habits that can reduce your risk of memory loss and dementia — and slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IMLNJTAYJECZP4KGP5YFRSF6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Think about risks and protective factors on a seesaw,” says Joel Salinas, a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City. “Your risk on one side and things that protect you against that risk” on the other. Even if you have a significant family history of dementia, for example, “there’s just so much you can do on the protective side of the seesaw to balance it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUQUS6ZDQBCHFIHBFA23ZGKTJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nearly half of all dementia cases worldwide could be delayed or prevented altogether by making lifestyle and environmental changes, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;2024 report published in the journal the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. These same practices — which include regular physical activity, a balanced diet, stress management and good sleep — can help slow the cognitive symptoms that come with normal aging. And recent research highlights other ways you can reduce your risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key activities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C42XBRMFLBFWBPTHH5UJSJQBIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/b&gt; Staying active enhances cognitive fitness in addition to physical fitness. People who engage in regular exercise have larger brain volumes than those who don’t. And a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9163715/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 58 studies&lt;/a&gt; found that physical activity was linked to a decreased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQ7NTHVXNJDGLFNH3GMZLDXZHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even mild to moderate activity has an effect,” says Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry, neurology, and gerontology at the Keck School of Medicine and Leonard Davis School of Gerontology of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WK23S3PSRJFXVLUFUHSVLN6E5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Of all my patients, those who have very structured and consistent exercise routines are the ones who tend to do the best,” Salinas says.

But a growing body of evidence shows that as the severity of hearing loss increases, the risk of developing dementia also rises.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It can be missed as a potential ADHD symptom because it looks like intentional laziness and lack of motivation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ADHD Centre says chronic procrastination can lead to problems in the workplace and at home, and it can also take an emotional toll, with feelings of shame, guilt or frustration stemming from not being able to complete simple tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it can be difficult for people with ADHD to start a task, O'Shea says once they do start, they can often find themselves hyperfocusing on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'Hyperfocus is a symptom that can easily be missed because it looks like the person is only motivated to do certain activities. It's sometimes mistaken as selfishness and overzealousness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Attention Deficit Association says that hyperfocus likely happens due to the way the ADHD brain is wired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It notes: 'A deficiency in dopamine, a chemical messenger of the brain, changes how the ADHD brain perceives reward and manages attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, managing your attention can be more difficult, making it easier to slip into hyperfocus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another lesser-known symptom of undiagnosed ADHD is an out-of-control shopping habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say impulsive spending could be another sign of ADHD as the disorder impacts impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have indicated that, on average, ADHD-related impulse spending costs individuals around $2,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mareen Dennis, a psychological practitioner with the University of Kentucky Department of Psychiatry, says some of the things people with ADHD can do to prevent impulse spending include using cash only in stores and deleting card and other payment information from online stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Running late all the time could be another subtle indicator you have ADHD, as the condition makes it trickier to keep track of time and focus on getting ready within a certain time frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining how 'time blindness' might present itself, O'Shea says: 'You might know the exact time of an appointment, but leave the house at that time rather than in advance to give yourself room to travel there, park and sign yourself in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you suddenly find yourself flying into a rage over a small thing, the experts say this too could be a symptom of ADHD, as the condition makes it difficult to regulate emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experts highlight that ADHD is often linked to abnormal eating patterns because of the inability to plan time well and keep focused on tasks (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, O'Shea notes, is related to the difficulties that can come with managing attention and directing energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regarding the extreme ADHD emotional mood swings, the Attention Deficit Association says: 'Imagine if traffic lights skipped yellow and went straight from green to red without warning - driving under these conditions would be very stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you have ADHD, handling your emotions might feel a bit like this. You may be calm and happy one moment. Then, without any warning, a small trigger can flip your emotions from green to red.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forgetting to eat isn't just because the workday is busy, it could also be a sign of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts highlight ADHD is often linked to abnormal eating patterns because of the inability to plan time well and keep focused on tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, binge eating - when you uncontrollably eat a large amount of food in a short amount of time - is most commonly associated with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Duke University estimates about 30 percent of adults with binge eating disorder, also have a history of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Roberto Olivardia, a clinical psychologist who specializes in the treatment of ADHD and eating disorders, says many individuals with the condition are on a 'see food diet... If they see it, they eat it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To overcome this, he suggests portioning meals in advance and practicing mindfulness while eating so you know when to stop when full.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep disorders are also linked to ADHD, and the Sleep Foundation reveals that children with the neurological condition are also more likely to experience nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that ADHD-related sleep problems such as insomnia may be 'a side effect of impaired arousal, alertness, and regulation circuits in the brain'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although some studies have suggested that these problems can also be 'traced to a delayed circadian rhythm with a later onset of melatonin production (the sleep hormone).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On a similar theme, constant restlessness or fidgeting is something experts say to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;O'Shea added: 'Adults [with ADHD] are more likely to show restlessness through having to get up and pace around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They might not be able to sit through a movie without talking or getting out their phone.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The restlessness caused by ADHD might also make it more difficult to make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some decisions might be impulsive, others might need more time to process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on why this happens, O'Shea says: 'This is a result of controlling attention well enough to sort through the pros and cons of a decision and remember what you were thinking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving to the final subtle sign, the experts say it is important to reflect on how you communicate with others, as this could be an indicator of your brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to increased impulsivity and a lack of ability to regulate emotions, ADHD can make communicating difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients might have difficulties focusing on conversations, actively listening, staying on topic and remembering details discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They might also cause offense by interrupting others, speaking before thinking and making regretful statements as their emotions get the better of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're diagnosed with ADHD, the condition can be managed to decrease the severity of symptoms. Many people use medication to help deal with the side effects, with the recommended drugs including stimulants and non-stimulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare providers often prescribe antidepressants, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:34:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQSXNLSjJ5LUdleWR0M3BSUC02cllab0J5NDlER1hjWWd1U3pOMkZpVzVJTlFKOXRkdjkzczQ4eWE3U2xFU051ZV84SnBiV0lWY1RiWlo0OWFEVVlHaUQ0WjluY0Z4SE4xWXJFQWE1Tkg0NXo2QjJ5OWVMSU1wT3pmWE1fSDhRM2hMOGVwS05jM3VZWk84bUtv0gGcAUFVX3lxTE5JNFpFODZkV1o4NzlrT1AtRlcwY3pKUVNxVk1SOVpUeVBjaDdreWd2LWoyQnVKbTNqRGlodnlNbG45MVRaZ2RtTERnbkxaTlNnM3diZmo3eXNldXJQTlRmdDlYNFZJNGJIb3dyZ1BtMVhmMjZQWUM1VmJxaVJhTXVJMTRDc0RMS0djZjd1NThQSWxJaEdRaUFSVkdOaQ</guid></item><item><title>Faced with measles, Texas healthcare workers confront ‘information warfare’ - Al Jazeera</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg css-mkhf1y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her work at hospitals or in-home healthcare, Parker explained she has often talked to patients about the importance of vaccines. Some listen. Many don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Parker has seen plenty of misinformation and disinformation over the years, she said the COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a petri dish there just waiting for that mess to proliferate,” she said in reference to vaccine scepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then the right wind came along, and it blew those spores all over the place: the spores of ignorance and misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rekha Lakshmanan observed something similar. She is the chief strategic officer for The Immunization Partnership, a Houston-based nonprofit that aims to eradicate preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She argued that Texas has long been a site of vaccine misinformation. But the pandemic “made the nation catch up with Texas”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False rumours flooded the internet, warning that vaccines could alter DNA or render people infertile. Some conspiracy theories even posited that the vaccine could be used for implanting chips into patients’ bodies for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all vaccine sceptics believe the misinformation. The way Lakshmanan sees it, vaccine hesitancy falls on a continuum. At the far end, there are those who cannot be convinced to get a vaccine, regardless of the data you present. Unfortunately, she said, that’s the loudest group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, others can be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to take a step back and see that there’s a bigger part of that continuum that’s parents, and they just have questions,” Lakshmanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that parents are often sifting through reams of misinformation, trying to understand what is real and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the anti-vaccine organisation Children’s Health Defense recently published a website that bore a striking resemblance to materials published by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its site was riddled with disinformation about vaccines. Kennedy, who served as a leader at Children’s Health Defense before joining the government, ultimately ordered the organisation to take the site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The challenge with misinformation is that it could look legit,” Lakshmanan said, “which is why we have to approach these conversations with empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes arguments about “parents’ rights”, which she says is entirely misleading. Anti-vaccine leaders like Kennedy have accused the government of forcing vaccination on parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one has ever said we should take away parents’ rights,” Lakshmanan told Al Jazeera. “It’s a red herring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:41:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>‘Worst fears are coming true’ about Trump cabinet member (Hint: It’s not Hegseth) - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90 500w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;quality=90 800w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="high" loading="eager" alt="HHS Kennedy West Virginia" decoding="async" class="article__image-content"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

NIH-funded study reveals variables, such as poverty and education, that may underpin higher rates of heart disease and its risk factors.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) uncovered higher rates of heart disease and worse heart health affecting adults living in rural communities compared to urban areas and the factors that likely drive these differences. They found adults living in rural areas were more likely than those living in large cities to have heart disease (7% vs. 4%), high blood pressure (37% vs. 31%), high cholesterol (29% vs. 27%), obesity (41% vs. 30%), and diabetes (11% vs. 10%). Across all age groups, the differences in high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes were largest among adults ages 20–39 living in rural areas vs. cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators reviewed data from more than 27,000 adults who participated in the 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2022-nhis.html"&gt;National Health Interview Survey&lt;/a&gt; to understand geographical differences in rates of heart disease and risk factors for conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Since higher rates of heart disease among adults in rural areas compared to cities have been established, they also sought to understand factors driving these variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that factors such as levels of income and education, having enough food to eat, and owning a home mostly explained the higher rates of people in rural areas who had high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Prior &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073510971935079X?via%3Dihub"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also shown how difficult circumstances, such as living in poverty, can affect cardiovascular health, including increasing inflammation in the body. Additionally, having access to healthcare, which is important for overall health, did not factor into these differences. Lifestyle risk factors for heart disease such as smoking and being less active also didn’t explain these differences, although adults living in rural areas were more likely to smoke and be less active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that rates of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease were largest in rural areas compared to cities in the South. Rates of obesity were higher across rural areas throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 60 million U.S. adults live in rural communities, and heart disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death. In this study, 1 in 7 adults lived in rural areas (counties of less than 50,000 people), 1 in 2 lived in small or medium-sized cities (counties of 50,000 to less than 1 million people), and 1 in 3 lived in large cities (counties of 1 million or more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying factors driving the higher burden of heart disease and risk factors in rural regions remains a critical research priority. The authors note that insights from their study could inform public health efforts and policies to support and improve the cardiovascular health of people — especially younger adults — living in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grant &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/eCTi0XSs90G8-zMPPpxrsQ/project-details/10938144#description"&gt;R01HL174549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

eMTBR-tau243, could be detected in blood and correlated with a build-up of tau tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, but not other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team’s analyses, which involved 902 participants, found levels of this tau fragment were elevated in people with Alzheimer’s symptoms who had mild cognitive impairment, and higher again in those with dementia. Levels were not raised in people with cognitive impairments due to other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Scientifically, these results are very promising and important as this marker performed better than existing tests and the new marker could help track performance of new drugs in trials,” said Prof Tara Spires-Jones, a neurodegeneration expert at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But, she said, it was not a foolproof blood test for Alzheimer’s&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is also not a simple test, rather requiring complex scientific methods only available in specialist laboratories, so this will not be routinely available without further validation and development of cheaper, easier detection,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Sheona Scales, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said eMTBR-tau243 was one of a number of different biomarkers being studied for use in blood tests for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“What’s interesting is that the blood levels of eMTBR-tau243 seem to be linked to a person’s memory and thinking abilities,” she said. “At present, it is not always possible to make a connection between the level of tangles observed with imaging and level of cognitive impairment, but having blood tests that do this will help to monitor diseases like Alzheimer’s in the brain as they progress, and help inform prognosis in future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Another piece of research&lt;/a&gt;, also published in Nature Medicine, has revealed the ratio of two proteins in brain fluid is associated with the degree of cognitive impairment experienced by people with Alzheimer’s, independent of levels of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This research, led by scientists in the US, involved samples from 3,397 people across the US, Sweden and Finland, and looked at levels of two proteins – YWHAG and NPTX2 – that are normally found at the junctions, or synapses, between neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team found the ratio of YWHAG:NPTX2 was better able to indicate that people were experiencing cognitive problems than their levels of amyloid beta and tau, and could be used to predict their future cognitive decline and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Tony Wyss-Coray, a co-author of the study from Stanford University, said the results could help identify the best medications for individuals and help design better clinical trials by selecting appropriate participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPZW5mNjBjTXEyNjkwVWY2MjZOenllME1DYUJnUFpqbUQwYjgtS2lPN01hWHlPYVg0SnZ5azloNWRzOHRfTnNnekNncWw2ZG9RZ0NTcDAza295REJ3NVJJeDNqbmkxN2ZaSDdaQjJ0QTBUWWlaS3hNbW45TGR0ZU54M1Y2aThlbFlsVWhpclJTcGYzampwbFpUNWtzUWRndy1oZURN</guid></item><item><title>Why Parents of Kids With ADHD Are So Worried Right Now - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTUJ4RkR1anVqeTZXa2pxMGczbXVpS3I4REtnZ180YmpVMnowOS1rem1xaTVSS3QzcHVFN2NnREhPd0w4ODgtZjVXT2Y1SDdCMTQyb21qdWl4RHBjcF9ESUJUZ2hZYjl0dTlCbnVCc3RCWDVsWTAzeFp3WjVUVzBMZGZ2alFkYldjT3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t18jex008sbbm7xb9qdlc4@published"&gt;For a couple of years, the driving forces of grade school—learning and friendships— were out of reach for Grace’s young daughter. The girl, who has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, would walk around the classroom, touching and distracting classmates. When she inevitably got in trouble, the child felt embarrassed and anxious, but it was impossible to control the impulsive behaviors. “She could not function in school, at all,” says Grace, who lives in central Oklahoma and whose last name is being withheld, like those of other parents in this article, to protect her daughter’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tno001k3b72mh9ug9k0@published"&gt;That began to change four years ago when the then-6-year-old started on stimulant medications to control her ADHD symptoms. After trying a few, the family found the right fit, and for the first time, learning and friendships felt like a real possibility for the girl.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001l3b724mjutqn2@published"&gt;Now it feels like the hard-won progress—for the girl and for our national understanding of the roughly 1 in 5 American children with neurodivergence—is at grave risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001m3b7286k1fzku@published"&gt;Underlying the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again campaign, and most particularly a February&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt; executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling out ADHD medications and other commonly prescribed drugs for children as potential “threats,” is the anti-science implication that neurodivergence is a fiction, curable, as suggested in the executive order, with a well-balanced diet and regular exercise. Parts of the order read a lot like &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5164123-robert-kennedy-jr-psychiatric-drugs-children/"&gt;recent declarations &lt;/a&gt;from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., offering another piece of evidence—as if his &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;persistent illusions of a link between vaccines and autism &lt;/a&gt;weren’t enough—that the secretary of health and human services believes that scientists and doctors are hurting rather than helping neurodivergent children. President Donald Trump recently announced that &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/parents-educators-worry-as-oversight-of-special-education-is-moved-to-hhs/"&gt;RFK Jr. will oversee special education&lt;/a&gt; for schools, meaning the secretary will now wield enormous influence in how children with disabilities are perceived and treated at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001n3b72sq9ski6z@published"&gt;It’s only in recent decades that it’s been widely understood how rooted the most common neurodivergent conditions like ADHD, autism, and dyslexia are in differences in brain structure or function, or both—and how treatable ADHD, in particular, can be with medications that alter that functioning. “The science of ADHD has shown that it’s a brain-based disorder. It’s not poor discipline; it’s not bad kids,” says Max Wiznitzer, professor of pediatrics and neurology at Case Western Reserve University and co-chair of the professional advisory board of the advocacy organization Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Specifically, for those with ADHD there’s an imbalance in the brain networks associated with attention and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001o3b72dd6n9fr6@published"&gt;To Grace and other parents, the executive order felt like a gut punch, with its implication that bad lifestyle choices can cause ADHD. “It makes me kind of rage honestly,” she says. “If it was that simple to fix without meds, we would have done it. Suggesting that ADHD is a parenting failure rather than a neurological difference is all kinds of messed up.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001p3b72ibhkfw2y@published"&gt;Neurodivergent children are by no means the only group of students with disabilities threatened by the Trump administration’s many wild, devastating actions. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/us/trump-news"&gt;Efforts to destroy&lt;/a&gt; the Department of Education could &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/403596/what-dismantling-the-education-department-means-for-kids-with-disabilities"&gt;decimate services and advocacy&lt;/a&gt; for students with disabilities ranging from deafness and blindness to learning and intellectual disabilities to all manner of neurodivergence, hurting students of color and marginalized children the most. Severe cuts to Medicaid will make it nearly impossible for lower-income families to access vital services and supports, starting at birth when extremely &lt;a href="https://hechingerreport.org/parents-of-premature-babies-struggle-to-get-help-their-children-are-entitled-to/"&gt;premature babies are automatically eligible&lt;/a&gt; for critical therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001q3b729740xwui@published"&gt;Yet it is notably with neurodivergent children, and those with mood disorders like depression, that the country’s leaders appear to be attacking the very essence and scientific understanding of disability. Repeatedly, RFK Jr. suggested before his appointment that children taking illegal narcotics, as well as ones prescribed ADHD stimulants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, could be well-served on “healing camps” or “wellness farms” where they would essentially be reparented—cut off from the corrupting influences of modern life and, it seems, modern medicine. Last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-maha-mental-health-wellness-farms.html"&gt;a recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the Cut, Kennedy claimed on a podcast that these farms could be particularly useful for Black children, saying, “Every Black kid is now just standard put on Adderall, on SSRIs, benzos.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001r3b72bkrr1icj@published"&gt;The executive order singled out ADHD stimulant medications such as Ritalin and Adderall, which aim to increase brain activity in areas related to attention and impulsivity. (Many children also take nonstimulants, which expand the levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that promotes focus and impulse control.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001s3b726obkqfm9@published"&gt;According to the executive order, the steady rise in diagnosis and use of prescription medications for ADHD among children, along with generally high rates of chronic illness and mental health issues, “poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001t3b72nlde6p9k@published"&gt;Yet never once does the order use the words &lt;em&gt;brain&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;neurodivergent&lt;/em&gt;, instead lumping disabilities like ADHD and autism in with diseases like asthma, Type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver, arguing that they can be addressed with “fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles,” and more steps in that same vein.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001u3b72mbbvw1nd@published"&gt;In other words, the administration, or at least the writers of the executive order, do not appear to understand the distinction between a brain variation (that you are born with) and a disease (which you can, indeed, sometimes develop through an unhealthy lifestyle). Wiznitzer notes that all competent pediatricians “encourage good diet. All of us encourage sleep and a healthy lifestyle. But even if you do that with the ADHD population, there is still going to be ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001v3b72ygjoyyuh@published"&gt;“The core symptoms,” he added, “respond best to medication,” with behavior therapy and classroom strategies also helping. But children with strong hyperactivity in particular, he said, most often need some medication to function effectively in school and in life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001w3b72hxs2f6ui@published"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18794206/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that ADHD medications can even alter some of the brain differences in children with the disorder, although Wiznitzer noted that “medicine is just one portion” of treatment and that expanded access to behavioral therapies and classroom support could help reduce some reliance on pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001x3b728nj6ogue@published"&gt;Yet availability of those therapies and supports—like occupational therapy and staff in schools trained in working with children with disabilities, including neurodivergence—could also become even more restricted. Public school districts across the country already were facing severe budget cuts with the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/schools-pandemic-aid-runs-out-00175065"&gt;disappearance of pandemic relief funds&lt;/a&gt;. And now the &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/department-education-cuts-expected-huge-impacts-teachers/story?id=119801563"&gt;slash-and-burn upheaval&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Education poses more budgetary uncertainty. While cuts could ultimately affect all students with disabilities, those with more mild to moderate disabilities, including many with ADHD, could feel the impact more quickly as schools strive to protect services for those with the most severe needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001y3b72yzcmwy3j@published"&gt;Children with ADHD are also a (seemingly) unintended target in &lt;a href="https://stateline.org/2025/02/20/gop-led-lawsuit-that-could-dismantle-disability-protections-draws-public-backlash/"&gt;an ongoing lawsuit by the attorney generals in 17 red states&lt;/a&gt; to declare unconstitutional the seminal Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a Civil Rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities by recipients of federal funding. (The stated reason for this challenge was the 2024 inclusion under the Biden administration of gender dysphoria as a protected disability. But experts say a conservative push against federalism in favor of greater states’ rights is also likely at play.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001z3b72ah88b6fx@published"&gt;Most children with disabilities get special education services in school through an IEP, or an individualized education program. But &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/media/document/crdc-student-disabilities-snapshotpdf-21420.pdf"&gt;more than a million children&lt;/a&gt; who aren’t eligible for an IEP, including countless students with ADHD, get accommodations in school through a 504 plan. In South Carolina, a state that is part of the lawsuit, the attorney general received about 1,000 emails from parents concerned about the possible end of 504 plans, says Mitchell Yell, a professor in special education at the University of South Carolina. “If [the lawsuit] is not thrown out, that would mean a lot of hardship,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnt00203b72zsp97jge@published"&gt;Officials in many of the states have told parents that they are not targeting school 504 plans, but “if Section 504 were declared unconstitutional, it would be catastrophic for people with all types of disabilities,” says Alison Barkoff, a professor at George Washington University, in an email. In regards to potential impact on school 504 plans, she says, “I don’t think they realize they stepped on the mama tiger third rail.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-section-div/instances/cm8t19u04002a3b7201qp7pt4@published" class="section-div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnt00213b72idmzlji3@published"&gt;It took over a century for scientists and doctors to develop a strong understanding of the brain science behind neurodivergence—an understanding that’s still being refined. At the start of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, behaviors that we would now describe as characterizing ADHD, for instance, were referred to as a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258430/"&gt;“defect of moral control,”&lt;/a&gt; according to a 2010 review article on the history of the disorder. Although the subject of morality doesn’t come up in the executive order, there’s an implicit morality policing of parents in the suggestion that the real cure to conditions like anxiety and ADHD lies in healthier meals, less screen time, more outdoor activity—ideas perfectly summed up in the vision of those “wellness camps” RFK Jr. has evoked. “It seems to imply that there is something corrupt about these people,” says Wiznitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00223b72kb7ku0pg@published"&gt;In the middle of the century, scientists made the connection between ADHD and the brain, writing that hyperactive behavior in children was caused by “damage” to the organ. That link to the brain was developed and refined over the next few decades. And ADHD, so named, first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1987 (for a few years before that, it was ADD with or without hyperactivity; and before &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, it was hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood). It wasn’t until the 1990s, though, that doctors came to understand that ADHD is not something that most people necessarily outgrow, says Wiznitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00233b729zmar4h5@published"&gt;The use of stimulants to treat ADHD—discovered by accident—long predates our contemporary understanding of the condition. But in more recent years, there’s been tremendous progress in refining and diversifying the types of medications available, particularly among the nonstimulant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00243b724glhg7vn@published"&gt;Shanna, a New Jersey mother of a 10-year-old who has ADHD and autism, says that at first she was deeply hesitant about putting her then 6-year-old on medication for ADHD. “I really thought we could control this with behavioral therapy,” Shanna recalls. “I don’t think any parent wants to give their kid medication they will be on for the rest of their life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00253b72a1civqrx@published"&gt;But the child wasn’t progressing academically, even with behavior therapy. At one point, a therapist stood near the child in the classroom and tapped her on the shoulder when she wasn’t paying attention. “What she learned is that she didn’t have to pay attention unless they touched her on the shoulder,” Shanna says. The pediatrician reminded the parents, “She has a chemical imbalance in her brain; she’s not going to outgrow this.” That clinched it.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00263b72j750v0j8@published"&gt;The parents first tried a stimulant medication, which proved disastrous: It didn’t help the inattention and the child lost 10 percent of her body weight. But the family regrouped and tried a nonstimulant that was more effective. Shanna credits the medication with finally giving her daughter the attention span to learn to read. “The differences were so startling,” she says. “It was shocking how well it worked.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00273b72xa27xm4t@published"&gt;Parents and pediatricians say no one treatment is a cure-all. Shanna’s daughter continues to receive a variety of in-home therapies for autism and for ADHD. She’s on the same nonstimulant drug she started four years ago. In school, she has several accommodations: Teachers always say the girl’s name first when asking her a question, and she has preferential seating at the front of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00283b72n63usnyu@published"&gt;The family watches the girl’s sleep, activity, and diet closely (they stopped giving her much chocolate years ago, for example, because it made her too excited). But Shanna calls the idea that this monitoring alone—as implied by the executive order—would solve her daughter’s ADHD symptoms “ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00293b72up2pjzib@published"&gt;For most kids with neurodivergence, including Shanna’s daughter, a combination of strategies and therapies is crucial to helping them live their best lives. And the prospect of taking a key treatment away from millions of kids, Wiznitzer says, is “like kicking the chair out from under the &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;child.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As SHOT has learned, those infected have been suffering from high fever and severe coughing up blood for weeks, while they have negative tests for Covid and flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The symptoms of those who fall ill are the same: it all starts with the usual aches and weakness, but after a couple of days the virus "cuts down" and it is impossible to get out of bed.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gennady Onishchenko, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency TASS: 'In St. Petersburg, we have the Pasteur Institute, which only deals with influenza, and its official report does not contain any information about any new virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, let's not brush this information aside... [but], most likely, there is no virus, let's not hype it up now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No infection control measures are reported to have been taken in Russia, while officials are said to be warning that 'spreading unverified information about public health can lead to unnecessary panic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts outside the country have been unable to verify the reports, but have warned online that the situation in Russia is 'very political'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon Sanders, a self-trained disease-tracker who helped track the early days of the Covid pandemic, wrote on her site &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/europe/pneumonia-respiratory-and-influenza-like-illnesses-ili-ac/russia-ad/1010785-russia-mystery-respiratory-virus-reported-in-the-media-gov-suggestion-of-metapneumovirus-march-29-2025"&gt;FluTrackers&lt;/a&gt;: 'Just a reminder... the Russia situation is very political.

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D was similarly effective for reducing disease activity among a subgroup of participants who would’ve been considered to have &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) under newer diagnostic criteria. CIS is a first episode of symptoms that suggests &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results make high-dose vitamin D an interesting candidate for further studies evaluating add-on therapy in the therapeutic strategy for managing MS,” the researchers wrote. The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;&lt;span&gt;High-Dose Vitamin D in Clinically Isolated Syndrome Typical of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system launches mistaken inflammatory attacks on healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord, leading to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt;, or areas of inflammation and damage. CIS is an initial episode of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; consistent with MS-related inflammation. Some people will never have additional disease activity, but others will go on to have another &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;relapse&lt;/a&gt; — a new bout of symptoms — or develop more lesions and will be considered to have converted to MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the proposed &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factors for MS&lt;/a&gt; are low vitamin D levels, as vitamin D modulates the immune system. Supplementing with vitamin D has been suggested as a way to help ease MS disease activity, but findings have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phase 3 &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01817166"&gt;D-Lay-MS trial (NCT01817166)&lt;/a&gt; was designed to see if high-dose cholecalciferol could prevent MS conversion from CIS. Cholecalciferol, or vitamin D3, is made by the skin upon sunlight exposure and can be found in certain food sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D and disease activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 303 adults, ages 18-55, who’d had a CIS episode in the last three months, but weren’t receiving any &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; (DMT), were randomly assigned to receive oral high-dose cholecalciferol (100,000 International Units) or a placebo once every two weeks until conversion to MS occurred, or for a maximum of two years. CIS was diagnosed based on the 2010 &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-diagnosis-mcdonald-criteria/"&gt;McDonald Criteria&lt;/a&gt;, a set of diagnostic guidelines for MS. The guidelines were revised in 2017, during the study period, under which 89% of the participants with sufficient data would’ve met the criteria to be &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were monitored for disease activity, defined as a new or enlarging lesion, or an active inflammatory lesion identified on &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;, or a relapse. As &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/20/ectrims-2024-high-dose-vitamin-d-delay-progression-ms/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, 60.3% of participants on vitamin D and 74.1% on the placebo saw such disease activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average time to the onset of new disease activity was nearly twice as long in the vitamin D group as in the placebo group (432 vs. 224 days), which was a statistically significant difference. The participants taking vitamin D were found to be at a significant, 34% lower risk of disease activity than those on the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All possible signs of MRI disease activity occurred less frequently in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group, including overall MRI activity (57.1% vs. 65.3%), new or enlarging lesions (46.2% vs. 59.2%), and active inflammatory lesions (18.6% vs. 34%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No significant differences were observed with relapses, which occurred in 17.9% of the vitamin D group and 21.8% of the placebo group. Vitamin D also didn’t have a significant impact on measures of disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subgroup who fulfilled the 2017 McDonald Criteria for RRMS, vitamin D was similarly associated with a 34% reduced risk of disease activity, suggesting it may also help in early RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who benefited most from vitamin D were those who, at the start of the study, didn’t have spinal cord lesions, had severe vitamin D deficiency, and a normal body mass index, an estimate of body fat based on weight and height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D treatment was generally safe and well tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings contrast those of a study where vitamin D &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10994527/"&gt;didn’t reduce disease activity&lt;/a&gt; in CIS. Still, the two studies had multiple differences, including in the dosing regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/news-and-magazine/news/d-lay-vitamin-d-results"&gt;news story&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/"&gt;National MS Society&lt;/a&gt; noted that, although study results have been mixed, “it is a good idea to make sure your vitamin D levels match what is recommended for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous clinical trials have also assessed the ability of certain DMTs to prevent disease activity in people with CIS. According to the scientists, vitamin D performed similarly well as those therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that cholecalciferol could represent an inexpensive therapeutic alternative, with low risk of adverse events, after a CIS, especially in populations with limited access to disease-modifying therapies,” wrote the researchers, who noted that vitamin D may be “an ideal candidate” as an add-on therapy to other treatments. They said mo larger and longer studies are still needed to evaluate this.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Need another reason to prioritize your sleep? Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50769434" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;slow-wave&lt;/a&gt; and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51106201" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep," Cho said. "That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer's prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer's supports the study's findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it's real," said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens in the brain during deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults don't get enough sleep, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say most adults should spend between 20% and 25% of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend about 50% of their sleep in REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you get more deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get," Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you have to do more than just lay in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there's an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added nearly five years to a man's life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, however, you can't wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can't be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't lose hope. The good news is that you can easily train your brain to better sleep by following what is called "sleep hygiene." It's important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you're falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep," Cho said. "There's no one medicine that improves overall sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="qp_all5451291"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qp_main5451291" fp="93084913-162" results="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long do you typically sleep at night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The effect was linked to dietary tryptophan deficiency, which lowers the production of serotonin—a neurotransmitter known to inhibit sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice that fasted every other day for months displayed significantly higher mating activity, even into old age, despite no improvements in sperm quality or hormone levels. Researchers suggest similar mechanisms may apply to humans, offering potential insights into non-pharmacological treatments for low libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Serotonin = Higher Libido:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting reduced serotonin, releasing behavioral inhibition in male mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased sex drive required fasting for at least 6 weeks, ideally 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to fasting-based treatments for low sexual desire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term fasting in 24-hour cycles increases the sex drive of male mice by lowering the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan—an amino acid that must be obtained through food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from DZNE report on this in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, together with a Chinese team from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108300"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in humans and view fasting as a potential approach for treating unwanted loss of sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a recurring subject of research because reduced food intake and thus calorie restriction has a variety of effects on the organism beyond the commonly observed weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Ehninger, research group leader at DZNE and lead author of the current study, and his team have also been working on this topic for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in the effects of fasting on aging. Using mice as a model, we investigate the underlying biological mechanisms. Our aim is to gain insights that may also be relevant to humans,” says the Bonn-based scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More offspring than expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research results now published are based on a fortuitous discovery, as Ehninger and his colleagues had originally set out to investigate something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to examine how fasting affects the offspring of male mice. However, one particular finding steered their research in a new direction: aged male mice—senior individuals by human standards—that had fasted for extended periods produced an unusually large number of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to initial hypotheses, this phenomenon was not due to fasting effects on reproductive organs or the endocrine state of the animals. Age-related changes in the testes, reduced sperm quality and lower testosterone levels, for example, argued against high fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of detective work to uncover the real cause,” says Ehninger, whose research group collaborated on the current study with experts from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences led by Prof. Yu Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, we realized: it is a matter of behavior. The fasting males had significantly more sexual contacts than mice that could eat freely. In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of mating and, as a result, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fasting in a 24-hour rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting at two months of age, these male mice were subjected to a specific form of intermittent fasting. Their access to food followed a recurring 24-hour pattern: the animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours with access to water only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 22-month fasting regimen, the males were housed together without any contact with females. They were later introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Effect takes time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased mating behavior was also observed in younger mice. These males had also started intermittent fasting at the age of two months, but had followed this diet for only six months before being introduced to females. They, too, were more sexually active than age-matched peers that had been fed ad libitum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the effect was absent in other experimental groups—both young and old—that fasted for only a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time,” says Zhou. “Based on our experiments, the minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A question of serotonin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of investigating the causes, attention eventually turned to neurotransmitters that influence sexual behavior. Some have a stimulating effect, while others act as inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the sexually active male mice, one factor stood out: serotonin—a chemical messenger generally associated with inhibitory effects—was present at unusually low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited; the usual regulatory restraint was diminished,” says Ehninger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract, but also in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter mediating communication between neurons. However, its synthesis depends on the amino acid tryptophan, which must be obtained through the diet or released through the breakdown of the body’s own protein stores, such as those found in muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid, meaning that neither mice nor humans can synthesize it on their own. As a result, dietary intake plays a key role in regulating tryptophan levels in the body. It is, in fact, found in many common foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of serotonin was clearly a result of fasting,” explains the DZNE researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the fasting regimen relevant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All in all, the fasting mice consumed almost 15% fewer calories than the animals in the control group. This also roughly applies to their intake of tryptophan,” says Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it is currently unclear whether the reduction in serotonin levels is linked to our specific feeding regimen or would also occur with other types of fasting. Future studies will need to clarify this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A potential approach for therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chemical messengers also play an important role in regulating sexual behavior in humans. This applies in particular to serotonin,” says Ehninger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he points out, this is evident, for example, in the use of SSRIs, a class of antidepressant drugs that increase serotonin levels. A potential side effect of this therapy is reduced libido. Conversely, lower serotonin levels are known to promote sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In view of this, I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting—possibly not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin affects their libido as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ehninger, there are actually only a few scientific studies on the effects of fasting on human libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, it would make sense to investigate this in more detail. I see potential for therapeutic applications. A lack of sexual desire is not necessarily perceived as problematic—but some people suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This condition is known as ‘hypoactive sexual desire disorder’ and particularly affects older adults. Fasting could potentially serve as a useful addition to existing treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and libido research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dan Ehninger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dan Ehninger – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.03.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Intermittent fasting boosts sexual behavior by limiting the central availability of tryptophan and serotonin&lt;/a&gt;” by Dan Ehninger et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent fasting boosts sexual behavior by limiting the central availability of tryptophan and serotonin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging affects reproductive capabilities in males through physiological and behavioral alterations, including endocrine changes and decreased libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the influence of intermittent fasting (IF) on these aging-related declines, using male C57BL/6J mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed that IF significantly preserved reproductive success in aged mice, not by improving traditional reproductive metrics such as sperm quality or endocrine functions but by enhancing mating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behavioral improvement was attributed to IF’s ability to counter age-dependent increases in serotonergic inhibition, primarily through the decreased supply of the serotonin precursor tryptophan from the periphery to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research underscores the potential of dietary interventions like IF in mitigating age-associated declines in male reproductive health and suggests a novel approach to managing conditions related to reduced sexual desire, highlighting the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and reproductive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:07:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9VVXk4RHFxaW1KNjBPR1c5Skt5VC1CcmplalJBaWRzSURnZjFJSTlXSVZoUG5CcHVVcGNnZzFDYWRZNnpGTDdBZVpVUVlBSVl2TzBVNXM2WnBvWmVnazdfbnVLOTRfYmIwNEQ4eDVFT3lENUZhdGROejlCVWVDZ9IBgwFBVV95cUxOYlRidlJQN3I5VWpwU3lKYXhiVlRjNG9zb0V2YlFLb2RPYnpfWjlGaXBvNWR6TThSZzMyVncwOTNEWk9sNWk3UDAxR29faXJicTJsMkE2VnpLVUJOdEJXc3l0MEk0NXpQWi1TYVp1QVJCcXlFUFFsN3JBMGExTTZINkdndw</guid></item><item><title>As avoidable deaths slowed globally, they rose in the U.S. - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPN2g4eWp2SmlwNGVsd013elJjbm9yV2I5WFhXc1I0aTBEbXBBYnRROFpDTGRqYzI4Q012UjZfSU1CQnZ0WnI5cmItTVNMcVdTNWlFMS1ha3pQd25iZnBnbzgzNUczT21TcUpwRnRMQmgwNEN0c25DMW50TmFhU1I0am9XaWtBcF9CYVRnWFlKYlRZOGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="47D2P73BMFCPLCIHJG4RWJWGWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;From 2009 to 2019, avoidable mortality increased by an average of 33 deaths per 100,000 people across the United States, according to an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831735" target="_blank"&gt;article published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJ4FZMAWFJBPDL3WBL4GOVB3HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the same decade that avoidable deaths increased in the United States, they dropped by an average of nearly 23 deaths per 100,000 across all other countries in the study.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a registered dietitian, I’m often asked what my favorite snacks are—not because my friends and clients are curious about what I eat (although some are) but because they’re overwhelmed by the options. There are more snack products, especially in the high-protein category, than ever before. While variety is good, it can be exhausting navigating the nutrition information and front-of-package claims. For that reason, I’m always happy to share my favorite snacks, especially from my favorite stores, like Trader Joe’s. I love their bags of nuts and cans of tuna, but if I’m looking for a satisfying high-protein snack, I always grab their Mediterranean Style Hummus Snack Pack with Pita Chips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re like me and always hungry, it’s nice to have a portable snack that you can carry with you when you’re on the move. I’ve enjoyed hummus as a snack for years, but it never made sense to carry a container of it in my lunch or snack bag. I portion it into little jars when I have time, but more often than not, I’m grabbing my snack as I’m running out the door. That’s why I love the convenience of Trader Joe’s pre-portioned packages of hummus and pita chips, which are perfectly sized and satisfying. The crunchy pita chips are a great way to scoop and enjoy every bite of that protein-packed hummus!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All nutrients are important and necessary for fueling your body and keeping it healthy. That’s why consuming a variety of foods is essential. But when it comes to snacking, I always recommend something with protein. Protein prompts the release of certain hormones, like cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and decreases the release of others, like ghrelin, to help slow digestion and reduce appetite.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that a snack with protein is usually more satisfying than one without. The hummus and pita chips snack pack from Trader Joe’s has 9 grams of protein, thanks to the combination of pita chips and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913550/are-chickpeas-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;garbanzo beans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is one of three macronutrients (carbohydrates and fat are the other two) essential for providing energy. It’s made up of amino acids, which are the “building blocks” responsible for and involved in almost every function in our bodies, from growing and repairing muscle and bone to transporting nutrients. Protein is found in a variety of foods, including both animals and plants. The amount of protein your body needs depends on age, gender, activity level and health. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults 19 and older consume 10% to 35% of their daily calories from protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For frame of reference, that’s about 200 to 700 calories from protein for a 2,000-calorie diet.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-something-a-good-high-protein-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes Something a Good High-Protein Snack? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are plenty of ways to build a high-protein snack. Fortunately many of them are nourishing and delicious. Direct food sources of protein are easy and straight-forward. You can start with thinking of the food groups. Dairy, eggs, meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, tofu, beans and lentils are all sources of protein. If your diet allows it, choose something from those categories, since a serving provides anywhere from 7 grams to upward of 25 grams of protein, with meat and seafood supplying the most for a 3-ounce portion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If a bar or other prepared snack is your preference, you’ll have to do a bit of reading before you buy. Many snacks, especially protein bars and granola bars, are high in added sugar and refined grains. To find a good snack, start with the Nutrition Facts panel, and look at the protein and added sugar. Go for a snack or bar with at least 7 grams of protein and less than 8 grams of added sugar. Next, review the ingredient list and opt for something made with whole grains versus refined grains—you’ll get more nutrients like fiber and B vitamins. And if you’re sensitive to artificial sweeteners, artificial flavors and preservatives, review the ingredient list for those and choose accordingly.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to enjoy a high-protein snack is between meals, before you get too ravenous. Usually a few hours after a meal is a good rule of thumb, but also listen to your body. If your meal was small or maybe didn’t provide enough nutrition, you may need something earlier. Or if your meal was large or something high in fiber and protein, you can wait a bit longer. Remember that a snack is smaller than a meal and should be satisfying enough to help get you to your next meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many of us enjoy snacks between meals, they can also be a crucial step in recovery after exercise, says cookbook author and sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://danawhitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dana Angelo White, M.S., RDN, ATC&lt;/a&gt;. She adds that a “balanced snack always benefits from some protein to help keep you feeling satisfied and energized.” Hummus, like my favorite from Trader Joe’s, is a great option, but White also recommends snacks like smoothies, yogurt bowls made with plain Greek yogurt, or a meat or peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which “are easy and effective foods that offer up protein and deliciousness—both are important!” But remember, says White,“It’s best to spread out protein intake throughout the day. Making sure most meals and snacks have a sensible amount of protein makes the task a lot easier.”  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to a snack that satisfies, choose something with a bit of protein. Keep things easy and try a handful of nuts or some cheese and whole-grain crackers. And if you happen to be at Trader Joe’s, grab their Mediterranean Style Hummus Snack Pack with Pita Chips!&lt;br&gt;

In the rest of the body, it stimulates muscle contractions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alongside antihistamines, other anticholinergics include tricyclic antidepressants, medications to control overactive bladder, and drugs to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December, a study of almost 1million British patients suggested some types of these medications can increase the risk of dementia by about third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;British experts analysed the health records of just over 170,000 patients in England over the age of 55 with dementia and compared them to 800,000 patients without the memory robbing disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the authors found taking an anticholinergic was linked to an 18 per cent increased risk of dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they found the elevated risk to be slightly higher in men — 22 per cent, compared to women at 16 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are thought to have dementia, but University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above symptoms are less well known signs of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly one million Britons and seven million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some specific types of the drugs often given to incontinence patients also carried a much higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those prescribed one, oxybutynin hydrochloride, had a 31 per cent higher risk of dementia, and those on another type, tolterodine tartrate, had a 27 per cent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts said their findings emphasised the need for medics to consider alternative treatments for overactive bladder in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside widespread over-the-counter use in sleep aids, NHS data suggests hundreds of thousands of prescriptions for anticholinergic are doled out on the NHS each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors, who published their research in the British Medical Journal, found that some types of anticholinergics weren't linked to an increased chance of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These were darifenacin, fesoterodine fumarate, flavoxate hydrochloride, propiverine hydrochloride, and trospium chloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also analysed a non-anticholinergic drug called mirabegron, which is also prescribed to patients with overactive bladders, but works using a different mechanism than anticholinergics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the scientists did find some evidence of dementia links to this drug, they noted the data wasn't clear, and further research is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The makers of Nytol, Panadol Night, Benylin and also Boots were approached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the rest of the body, it stimulates muscle contractions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alongside antihistamines, other anticholinergics include tricyclic antidepressants, medications to control overactive bladder, and drugs to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December, a study of almost 1million British patients suggested some types of these medications can increase the risk of dementia by about third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;British experts analysed the health records of just over 170,000 patients in England over the age of 55 with dementia and compared them to 800,000 patients without the memory robbing disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the authors found taking an anticholinergic was linked to an 18 per cent increased risk of dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they found the elevated risk to be slightly higher in men — 22 per cent, compared to women at 16 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are thought to have dementia, but University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above symptoms are less well known signs of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly one million Britons and seven million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some specific types of the drugs often given to incontinence patients also carried a much higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those prescribed one, oxybutynin hydrochloride, had a 31 per cent higher risk of dementia, and those on another type, tolterodine tartrate, had a 27 per cent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts said their findings emphasised the need for medics to consider alternative treatments for overactive bladder in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside widespread over-the-counter use in sleep aids, NHS data suggests hundreds of thousands of prescriptions for anticholinergic are doled out on the NHS each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors, who published their research in the British Medical Journal, found that some types of anticholinergics weren't linked to an increased chance of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These were darifenacin, fesoterodine fumarate, flavoxate hydrochloride, propiverine hydrochloride, and trospium chloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also analysed a non-anticholinergic drug called mirabegron, which is also prescribed to patients with overactive bladders, but works using a different mechanism than anticholinergics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the scientists did find some evidence of dementia links to this drug, they noted the data wasn't clear, and further research is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The makers of Nytol, Panadol Night, Benylin and also Boots were approached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-know-about-top-fda-vaccine-official-s-ouster"&gt;What to know about top FDA vaccine official’s ouster &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peter Marks resigned from his post as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator Friday after Trump administration officials told him it was that or be fired. Public health experts, former FDA commissioners, and biotech executives alike &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/fda-peter-marks-cber-director-resigns-rfk-jr/" rel=""&gt;are alarmed by Marks’ ouster and what it portends&lt;/a&gt; about containing infectious disease given health secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine agenda. “[I]t has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks wrote in his resignation letter, saying Kennedy has undermined confidence in vaccines at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-400-cases-five-states/" rel=""&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; are growing across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/fda-peter-marks-cber-director-resigns-rfk-jr/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; from a deep bench of STAT reporters on Marks’ resignation and reactions across the health and life sciences communities, including the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/29/fda-peter-marks-ouster-alarms-biopharma-that-saw-him-as-ally/" rel=""&gt;pharma and biotech execs&lt;/a&gt; who had mostly stayed quiet about the new administration till now. From the CEO of Ovid Therapeutics: Marks’ letter “signals that the very infrastructure we rely on to evaluate, approve, and monitor life-saving medicines — and to protect patients from harm — is at risk of collapse.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-texas-measles-cases-jump-20"&gt;Texas measles cases jump 20%&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking of measles, the outbreak in Texas is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-400-cases-five-states/" rel=""&gt;getting worse&lt;/a&gt;. Officials said they had identified 400 cases as of Friday, primarily in the western part of the state, a 20% jump from 327 cases just a few days prior on March 25. Outbreaks are also underway in New Mexico (44 cases), Kansas (23 cases), Oklahoma (9 cases), and Ohio (10 cases). The CDC defines outbreaks as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news comes as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/rfk-jr-hhs-measles-outbreak-infant-formula-plan-criticism-fda-scott-gottlieb/?utm_campaign=rss" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/rfk-jr-hhs-measles-outbreak-infant-formula-plan-criticism-fda-scott-gottlieb/?utm_campaign=rss" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;alarm grows among public health experts&lt;/a&gt; over HHS secretary Kennedy’s response to the outbreak, including his suggestion that things like vitamin A and cod liver oil could be effective treatments for measles. Recent federal cuts have impacted people who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/trump-cuts-local-public-health-departments/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/trump-cuts-local-public-health-departments/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;track the spread&lt;/a&gt; of measles and other infectious diseases, and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/vaccine-hestitancy-research-nih-canceled-mental-illness/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/vaccine-hestitancy-research-nih-canceled-mental-illness/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;canceled grants&lt;/a&gt; include research on vaccine hesitancy. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-400-cases-five-states/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fda-clears-at-home-test-for-three-stis"&gt;FDA clears at-home test for three STIs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/prevalence-incidence-and-cost-estimates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/prevalence-incidence-and-cost-estimates.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;one in five people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. have a sexually transmitted infection on any given day. But people may put off going to the doctor’s office to get checked out, whether because of the anxiety and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/30/syphilis-rates-climbing-stigma/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/30/syphilis-rates-climbing-stigma/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;stigma&lt;/a&gt; that’s still associated with STIs or other barriers to care. Many public health experts see at-home tests as a promising way to curb the spread of infections and help people get the treatment they need — an alternative that’s made further gains with the FDA authorization on Friday of an at-home test for chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis from Visby Medical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kit, which is meant for women, includes a vaginal swab for collecting a sample as well as a testing device that provides results within 30 minutes, and can be purchased without a prescription. The FDA authorization follows its 2023 clearance of an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/15/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-home-test-fda-approval/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/15/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-home-test-fda-approval/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;at-home test&lt;/a&gt; for chlamydia and gonorrhea, although that test required people to send their samples to a laboratory in order to get results. The agency also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/08/16/syphilis-test-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/08/16/syphilis-test-at-home/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; an at-home test for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/12/std-rates-syphilis-and-gonorrhea-cases-fall-in-u-s/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/12/std-rates-syphilis-and-gonorrhea-cases-fall-in-u-s/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-differences-between-men-s-and-women-s-hearts"&gt;The differences between men’s and women’s hearts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459463/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459463/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;look different in women&lt;/a&gt; — rather than clutching their chests, as men stereotypically do, they may experience more diffuse pain shooting through their jaw, neck, arm, back, and stomach. That’s just one of the myriad sex and gender differences in cardiovascular disease that researchers have discovered, from risk factors to the number and function of muscle cells in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a moment when research into women’s health is under threat in the United States as a casualty of the Trump administration’s attack on diversity efforts, researchers are worried that this kind of potentially lifesaving progress may be stymied. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/heart-disease-women-dei-bans-threaten-research-sex-differences-in-cardiovascular-disease/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/heart-disease-women-dei-bans-threaten-research-sex-differences-in-cardiovascular-disease/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Read more from Liz Cooney&lt;/a&gt; on what we’ve learned about women and heart disease in recent years, and where experts say we should focus next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-end-of-cadavers-in-medical-school-training"&gt;The end of cadavers in medical school training&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More medical schools are phasing out the use of cadavers in favor of virtual reality and other 3-D visualization tools. That means future doctors will lose out on a valuable education about being comfortable in the presence of death, according to First Opinion writer and medical student Nadir Al-Saidi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Coming face-to-face with a body in that raw state was one of the most powerful moments of my first year in medical school,” Al-Saidi writes of an early encounter with a cadaver. “It taught me reverence and the gravity of what it means to choose this path in health care.” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/medical-school-cadaver-lab-body-donation-technology-substitute/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/medical-school-cadaver-lab-body-donation-technology-substitute/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; — and if you want to learn more about the long and ethically complicated history of cadavers in medical training as well as in uses like crash testing, check out Mary Roach’s 2006 book “&lt;a href="https://maryroach.net/stiff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://maryroach.net/stiff.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Stiff&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-already-rare-cardiac-deaths-during-marathons-have-fallen"&gt;Already rare, cardiac deaths during marathons have fallen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just in time for spring marathons, we have a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.3026?guestAccessKey=1590ae63-6f44-4e97-8268-ca336f122100&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.3026?guestAccessKey=1590ae63-6f44-4e97-8268-ca336f122100&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033025" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;study published Sunday in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; updating the infrequent but alarming incidence of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/14/sudden-cardiac-arrest-research-cardiovascular-risk-factors-improve-survival-rate/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/14/sudden-cardiac-arrest-research-cardiovascular-risk-factors-improve-survival-rate/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; among runners. It’s quite rare that someone’s heart will stop beating on the race course, and even rarer that they will die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news: The death rate fell by nearly half in a recent case series from 2010 through 2023 compared to rates gleaned in an initial study conducted the decade before. There were 59 deaths and 117 survivors for a case fatality rate of 34%, down from 71%&lt;strong data-stringify-type="bold"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the earlier timeframe. Incidence was stable, which means among more than 29 million competitors in full and half-marathons — triple the participants reported in the initial &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1106468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1106468" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;RACER study&lt;/a&gt; — there were 176 cardiac arrests, most among men, most during a marathon and most after the 20-mile point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why the change? The authors point to CPR and AEDs on the course. Every runner in cardiac arrest got resuscitation and most had access to a defibrillator to shock their hearts back into rhythm. That puts race routes on a par with airports and casinos for AED availability. &lt;em&gt;— Liz Cooney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that older adults with mild cognitive issues performed worse on odor identification and memory tasks than cognitively normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, administered in English and Spanish, was equally effective across language groups and whether or not participants were supervised. These findings support the use of smell tests as a noninvasive screening tool to identify people at risk for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases before memory symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At-Home Feasibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants successfully completed the smell test at home without supervision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olfactory-Cognition Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with mild cognitive impairment showed reduced odor memory and identification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Inclusivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Test results were consistent across English- and Spanish-speaking participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to early detection of cognitive impairment, a new study suggests that the nose knows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham developed olfactory tests — in which participants sniff odor labels that have been placed on a card — to assess people’s ability to discriminate, identify, and remember odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108288"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a nose." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/olfaction-test-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team found that odor identification, memory, and discrimination declined with age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that participants could successfully take the test at home and that older adults with cognitive impairment scored lower on the test than cognitively normal adults. Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early detection of cognitive impairment could help us identify people who are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease and intervene years before memory symptoms begin,” said senior author Mark Albers of the Laboratory of Olfactory Neurotranslation, the McCance Center for Brain Health, Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, and an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our goal has been to develop and validate a cost-effective, noninvasive test that can be performed at home, helping to set the stage for advancing research and treatment for Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albers and colleagues are interested in whether olfactory dysfunction — the sometimes-subtle loss of sense of smell — can serve as an early warning sign for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albers helped found a company that makes the Aromha Brain Health Test, which is the test used by the research team to conduct the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the olfactory test, the team recruited English- and Spanish-speaking participants with subjective cognitive complaints (those with self-reported concerns about memory) and participants with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared these participants’ test results with those from people who had no sense of smell and with cognitively normal individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that odor identification, memory, and discrimination declined with age. They also found that older adults with mild cognitive impairment had lower scores for odor discrimination and identification compared with older adults who were cognitively normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that test results were similar across English- and Spanish-speakers, and participants performed the test equally successfully regardless of whether they were observed by a research assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that future studies could incorporate neuropsychological testing and could follow patients over time to see if the tool can predict cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that olfactory testing could be used in clinical research settings in different languages and among older adults to predict neurodegenerative disease and development of clinical symptoms,” said Albers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General Brigham Communications – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92826-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;” by Mark Albers et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost-effective, noninvasive screening methods for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders remain an unmet need. The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABHT was self-administered among cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 127), participants with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 34), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:54:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE0tTDVrYUNsQUR5SGg2c3BFRVBjOTJkV3hlWDB5UTgzbGxoOVFHczNiT1dYQ2lVTlZiY2pNeFFQWlhEc0RkVG5oOVdjaWVaclVLUDhGUGl0VV9iS2xfVE9jRnJTQTExQ1ox</guid></item><item><title>Highly contagious airborne disease outbreak in US sparks travel warning - Daily Express US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBnSWtIZU8yUVFvdV8wTVdPckFrTTNVZ3RfRmNjZlNzeWxPSVdmLVY2ZDN2dFd4QjFmUTZlZ01NQU1vb0ZoNGVfSFZ3cHRsbGFmTXhjVjlXZVM4ZHNkR0JxSVZyc0swcXJwNWtGY09PZEFoU2xQdHfSAXtBVV95cUxNQnh5RUZfNHhLVF9NQWtMNFRuR3IyVFhQWXBJakhfVVFERzMyTWtvdTFzVV9kUTNTbXFFLW45ZlhDRUZYbF93cTYyc0ZJREtDeWhtQ3ZFUXM2R2FMbnhBOXZYckg2VFpBOWhKejRVT1NlMk1DRE81cHFHWVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has sounded the alarm with travel advisories due to &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/167284/washington-DC-measles-case-amtrak"&gt;a surge in cases&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/166912/texas-mom-stands-decision-vaccinate-after-daughter-dies-from-measles"&gt;an airborne virus&lt;/a&gt; across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly contagious disease and &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/164436/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico"&gt;a significant killer of young children worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, is on the rise. The WHO highlighted that the virus spreads through droplets from infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already surpassing last year's figures, the US has confirmed 420 measles cases this year, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/166422/texas-measles-outbreak-reaches-259-unvaccinated"&gt;with a concentration in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; and now seeping into adjacent states, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/highly-contagious-air-borne-disease-34949272"&gt;reports the Daily Star. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston's computational epidemiologist, Benjamin Rader, expressed his concern about the prevalence of measles among those unvaccinated or with uncertain vaccination histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "We are experiencing an extremely concerning decline in measles vaccination in the very group most vulnerable to the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to watch for include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and white spots inside the mouth. A rash typically follows these symptoms, appearing 10-14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe cases of measles can result in pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infections, brain inflammation (encephalitis), blindness, and even death. While there's no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most patients recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radar explained: "The worry is that once measles gains a foothold in the community, it'll transition from isolated outbreaks to an endemic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON'T MISS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/politics/167411/trump-administration-halts-billion-health-funding" target="_blank" data-name="Trump cuts $12 billion in pandemic funding amid bird flu and measles crisis"&gt;Trump cuts $12 billion in pandemic funding amid bird flu and measles crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/167284/washington-DC-measles-case-amtrak" target="_blank" data-name="DC on alert as highly contagious disease detected in Amtrak passenger"&gt;DC on alert as highly contagious disease detected in Amtrak passenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/166912/texas-mom-stands-decision-vaccinate-after-daughter-dies-from-measles" target="_blank" data-name="Mom of girl who died of measles says 'disease wasn't that bad' as cases rise"&gt;Mom of girl who died of measles says 'disease wasn't that bad' as cases rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO is advising international travelers to ensure their vaccinations against measles are current before traveling, with a particular emphasis on those heading to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization also recommends that residents in U.S. outbreak areas adhere to local health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has issued a statement emphasizing the importance of widespread access to the &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Measles" href="/latest/measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to keep general population vaccination rates high and protect individuals at increased risk of exposure, such as healthcare workers and international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization said: "Unvaccinated individuals from areas in the United States experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: "At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has been clear in its stance on vaccination against the virus to halt its spread, stating: "Immunization against measles prevents measles and its complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:35:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBnSWtIZU8yUVFvdV8wTVdPckFrTTNVZ3RfRmNjZlNzeWxPSVdmLVY2ZDN2dFd4QjFmUTZlZ01NQU1vb0ZoNGVfSFZ3cHRsbGFmTXhjVjlXZVM4ZHNkR0JxSVZyc0swcXJwNWtGY09PZEFoU2xQdHfSAXtBVV95cUxNQnh5RUZfNHhLVF9NQWtMNFRuR3IyVFhQWXBJakhfVVFERzMyTWtvdTFzVV9kUTNTbXFFLW45ZlhDRUZYbF93cTYyc0ZJREtDeWhtQ3ZFUXM2R2FMbnhBOXZYckg2VFpBOWhKejRVT1NlMk1DRE81cHFHWVE</guid></item><item><title>Neurologist wins Dystel Prize for research on immune cells in MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNMWVpTUY5R2pZNUFvMGg0bEFzYWtRY1J1Uzl6eEVCRURMODd6cmJ1WnZZTjVCcVJyUTNVdEtMYXpnZDNHQlN5MS00di1BN3lqVGZRQ3N6LXNmb2ViZ2VtcFBpVWtDcUQxaE1ZMzRWMmNUX3I3Zm1XZkhZTVhjdHFDbXZUaF9rM0JuVVl4a00yeGxHdkt3M09ma3U3bTMxZXZtWTdDcGtGdHVzT0NyX1FMUlBwcGZKYUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher and neurologist at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia has won the 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/research/john-dystel-prize-for-multiple-sclerosis-research"&gt;John Dystel Prize&lt;/a&gt; for Multiple Sclerosis Research for his work in uncovering immune mechanisms of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), identifying disease biomarkers, and finding new avenues toward tailored medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize comes with a sculpture and $40,000, “to be used at the recipient’s discretion,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077660"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which jointly awarded the honor with the &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/"&gt;American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt; (AAN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be awarded April 8, at the AAN 2025 annual meeting in San Diego, the prize this year goes to Amit Bar-Or, MD, a professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania and chief of the division of MS and related disorders. He’ll deliver his &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/msa/Public/Events/Details/18449"&gt;Dystel Prize lecture&lt;/a&gt; on the same day, per the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Bar-Or has been a key player in shaping the evolving conceptual framework of MS, including how the field thinks about early diagnosis, disease mechanisms, effective treatment, and stopping disease progression,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National MS Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bar-Or said he is “deeply [honored]” to be awarded the Dystel Prize this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing more gratifying than being recognized by one’s peers — which at least suggests our work is on the right track, as part of international efforts by multiple groups aimed at further elucidating MS disease mechanisms and optimizing care for individuals living with MS,” Bar-Or said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Scientist’s research into MS has contributed to new treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his research journey, Bar-Or has advanced the understanding of how B-cells — the immune cells responsible for producing antibodies — drive other immune cells to damage the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt; that covers nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. That damage ultimately results in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on B-cells paved the way for many of the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; used today to reduce disease activity and slow the accumulation of disability in MS. Bar-Or also helped determine the mechanism of action for approved medications and experimental ones, like Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, now in Phase 3 clinical testing, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Hafler, MD, a professor at Yale School of Medicine and winner of the 2010 John Dystel Prize, said Bar-Or “has made seminal discoveries.” Hafler, who nominated Bar-Or for the award, added that “his involvement in clinical trial programs and translational work has led to B-cell therapies that have been transformative in the treatment of MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;[Bar-Or’s] contributions to neuroimmunology, precision medicine, and biomarker studies have a direct impact on the treatment of people with MS, and I am excited to see his research continue to inform how to stop disease progression and ultimately end MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to his work on B-cells, Bar-Or has developed a precision neuroimmunology platform to group patients based on their immune cell responses. This work could help doctors decide on the best course of treatment — for instance, selecting the best approach for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/next-steps-after-ms-diagnosis/"&gt;newly diagnosed patients&lt;/a&gt; or determining whether or not to stop treatment for individuals experiencing stable disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bar-Or’s research also resulted in the identification of biomarkers of MS in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which is the liquid flowing around the brain and spinal cord. Biomarkers can be used for more accurate diagnosis or to predict how quickly the disease will progress or how patients will respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bebo, the researcher’s “contributions to neuroimmunology, precision medicine, and biomarker studies have a direct impact on the treatment of people with MS, and I am excited to see his research continue to inform how to stop disease progression and ultimately end MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Disease forecasts are like weather forecasts: We cannot predict the finer details of a particular outbreak or a particular storm, but we can often identify when these threats are emerging and prepare accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viruses that cause avian influenza are potential threats to global health. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-joint-fao-who-woah-assessment-of-recent-influenza-a(h5n1)-virus-events-in-animals-and-people_dec2024"&gt;Recent animal outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; from a subtype called H5N1 have been especially troubling to scientists. Although human infections from H5N1 have been relatively rare, there have been a &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2021-dha-docs/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025.pdf"&gt;little more than 900 known cases globally&lt;/a&gt; since 2003 – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMe2416323"&gt;nearly 50% of these cases have been fatal&lt;/a&gt; – a mortality rate about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030"&gt;20 times higher&lt;/a&gt; than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. If the worst of these rare infections ever became common among people, the results could be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching potential disease threats from an anthropological perspective, my colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ron-Barrett-2"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; recently published a book called “&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/emerging-infections-9780192843135"&gt;Emerging Infections: Three Epidemiological Transitions from Prehistory to the Present&lt;/a&gt;” to examine the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/future-pandemics-will-have-the-same-human-causes-as-ancient-outbreaks-lessons-from-anthropology-can-help-prevent-them-224622"&gt;ways human behaviors have shaped&lt;/a&gt; the evolution of infectious diseases, beginning with their first major emergence in the Neolithic period and continuing for 10,000 years to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from this deep time perspective, it becomes evident that H5N1 is displaying a common pattern of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05775"&gt;stepwise invasion&lt;/a&gt; from animal to human populations. Like many emerging viruses, H5N1 is making incremental evolutionary changes that could allow it to transmit between people. The periods between these evolutionary steps present opportunities to slow this process and possibly avert a global disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spillover and viral chatter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a disease-causing pathogen such as a flu virus is already adapted to infect a particular animal species, it may eventually evolve the ability to infect a new species, such as humans, through a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-spillover-bird-flu-outbreak-underscores-need-for-early-detection-to-prevent-the-next-big-pandemic-200494"&gt;process called spillover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spillover is a tricky enterprise. To be successful, the pathogen must have the right set of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004129"&gt;molecular “keys”&lt;/a&gt; compatible with the host’s molecular “locks” so it can break in and out of host cells and hijack their replication machinery. Because these locks often vary between species, the pathogen may have to try many different keys before it can infect an entirely new host species. For instance, the keys a virus successfully uses to infect chickens and ducks may not work on cattle and humans. And because new keys can be made only through random mutation, the odds of obtaining all the right ones are very slim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these evolutionary challenges, it is not surprising that pathogens &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05775"&gt;often get stuck&lt;/a&gt; partway into the spillover process. A new variant of the pathogen might be transmissible from an animal only to a person who is either &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.45"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; due to preexisting illness or more likely to be infected because of extended exposure to the pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, the pathogen might not be able to break out of its human host and transmit to another person. This is the current situation with H5N1. For the past year, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;many animal outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of wild and domestic animals, especially among birds and cattle. But there have also been a small number of human cases, most of which have occurred among &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2414610"&gt;poultry and dairy workers&lt;/a&gt; who worked closely with large numbers of infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/654010/original/file-20250309-56-8c7d2b.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Pathogen transmission can be modeled in three stages. In Stage 1, the pathogen can be transmitted only between nonhuman animals. In stage 2, the pathogen can also be transmitted to humans, but it is not yet adapted for human-to-human transmission. In Stage 3, the pathogen is fully capable of human-to-human transmission.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists call this situation &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250012210/theviralstorm/"&gt;viral chatter&lt;/a&gt;: when human infections occur only in small, sporadic outbreaks that appear like the chattering signals of coded radio communications – tiny bursts of unclear information that may add up to a very ominous message. In the case of viral chatter, the message would be a human pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sporadic, individual cases of H5N1 among people suggest that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2024.101416"&gt;human-to-human transmission&lt;/a&gt; may likely occur at some point. But even so, no one knows how long or how many steps it would take for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses evolve rapidly. This is partly because two or more flu varieties can infect the same host simultaneously, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0141"&gt;reshuffle their genetic material with one another&lt;/a&gt; to produce entirely new varieties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/654237/original/file-20250310-56-167183.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Genetic reshuffling – aka antigenic shift – between a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza and a strain of human influenza could create a new strain that’s even more infectious among people.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.4062/biomolther.2014.005"&gt;Eunsun Yoo/Biomolecules &amp;amp; Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-NC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reshuffling events are more likely to occur when there is a diverse range of host species. So it is particularly concerning that H5N1 is known to have infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44358-024-00008-7"&gt;at least 450 different animal species&lt;/a&gt;. It may not be long before the viral chatter gives way to larger human epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reshaping the trajectory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that people can take basic measures to slow down the evolution of H5N1 and potentially reduce the lethality of avian influenza should it ever become a common human infection. But governments and businesses will need to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can start by taking better care of food animals. The &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass"&gt;total weight of the world’s poultry&lt;/a&gt; is greater than all wild bird species combined. So it is not surprising that the geography of most &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00699.x"&gt;H5N1 outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; track more closely with large-scale housing and international transfers of live poultry than with the nesting and migration patterns of wild aquatic birds. Reducing these agricultural practices could help curb the evolution and spread of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/654011/original/file-20250309-62-t0uaeu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Large-scale commercial transport of domesticated animals is associated with the evolution and spread of new influenza varieties.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/b3nscott/2512789670"&gt;ben/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can also take better care of themselves. At the individual level, most people can vaccinate against the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03721-24"&gt;common, seasonal influenza viruses&lt;/a&gt; that circulate every year. At first glance this practice may not seem connected to the emergence of avian influenza. But in addition to preventing seasonal illness, vaccination against common human varieties of the virus will reduce the odds of it mixing with avian varieties and giving them the traits they need for human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the population level, societies can work together to &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/emerging-infections-9780192843135"&gt;improve nutrition and sanitation&lt;/a&gt; in the world’s poorest populations. History has shown that better nutrition increases overall resistance to new infections, and better sanitation reduces how much and how often people are exposed to new pathogens. And in today’s interconnected world, the disease problems of any society &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126795"&gt;will eventually spread&lt;/a&gt; to every society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than 10,000 years, human behaviors have shaped the evolutionary trajectories of infectious diseases. Knowing this, people can reshape these trajectories for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Each individual’s microbial mix affects digestion, immunity, and many other human processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six years, scientists tracked the microbiomes of people ranging from 29 to 75 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They collected samples from the gut, mouth, nose, and skin, observing how these organisms changed during short-term illnesses, chronic conditions, and daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Snyder, Ph.D., from &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; and director of the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, led this wide-ranging effort with the late George Weinstock at &lt;a href="https://www.jax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trillions-of-microbes-shape-who-we-are"&gt;Trillions of microbes shape who we are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers confirm that the human microbiome contains about 39 trillion microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results underscore the idea that we each have individualized microbiomes in our bodies that are special to us,” Snyder states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes, diet, and the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-may-be-the-best-strategy-to-boost-your-immune-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; all shape these communities, which vary greatly between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diversity matters for health. Each person’s bacteria respond to internal factors, refuting any notion that everyone shares identical microbial residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators suggest that understanding these differences could open new possibilities for personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-temporary-microbial-changes-observed"&gt;Temporary microbial changes observed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,432 biological samples produced more than 118 million measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists used genetic sequencing to identify microbial populations during routine checkups or unusual events, such as vaccinations or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-increasing-enterococci-looming-global-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xin Zhou, Ph.D., notes, “People with Type 2 diabetes showed a less stable and less diverse microbiome,” hinting that limited variety may connect with certain illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-term infections caused temporary disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that when you get sick with something like a cold, you have this temporary change in the microbiome; it becomes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-could-cause-a-health-crisis-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;very dysregulated&lt;/a&gt;,” Zhou explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With diabetes, that signature is the same in many ways except that it is long-term rather than temporary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personal-microbes-are-the-most-stable"&gt;Personal microbes are the most stable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another finding challenged expectations about which bacteria remain most consistent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people would suspect that the bacteria shared among us would be the most important and thus the most stable. We found the complete opposite – the personal microbiome is the most stable,” Snyder expounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that unique &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/household-plumbing-is-full-of-microbial-communities-that-might-be-a-health-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbial communities&lt;/a&gt; within each person often stay steady despite environmental influences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight highlights how individual baselines shape resilience during illness or dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interconnection-across-human-microbiomes"&gt;Interconnection across human microbiomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifts in the nose, mouth, or skin coincided with changes in the gut, suggesting that these microbes behave like “a single, fluid system,” according to Snyder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain immune proteins in the blood moved in sync with these shifts, indicating strong ties between microbial balance and immune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors, including humidity and seasonal effects, influenced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/warming-waters-are-dramatically-changing-microbial-life-in-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbial composition&lt;/a&gt; but could not explain the large differences seen across participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underscores that each person’s body creates a unique habitat for bacteria, making it hard to define a universal standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-the-human-microbiome-matter"&gt;Why does the human microbiome matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists propose that the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-meditation-transforms-gut-microbes-for-optimal-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;composition and stability&lt;/a&gt; of a person’s microbiome may help predict how they respond to illnesses or treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The microbiome varies enormously between people. How you feed it and what it’s exposed to probably makes a big impact on your health, and we still have to work that out in many ways,” Snyder concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights from this work point to individualized strategies that account for specific microbial features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on personal baselines, future research may offer medical guidance tailored to each individual’s microbes, potentially improving &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;long-term wellness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolution-of-scientific-understanding"&gt;Evolution of scientific understanding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in microbes dates back to the late 1600s, when early microscopes revealed tiny organisms in water droplets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, scientists concentrated on harmful bacteria, overlooking beneficial ones. Over time, researchers uncovered the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nasa-says-the-international-space-station-is-too-clean-add-microbes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;importance of friendly bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that assist with immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “microbiome” gained traction in the early 2000s, accompanied by growing awareness that these microbial residents are not merely passengers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing projects, including broad genetic investigations, have shown that microbial diversity can shift with diet, medications, and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evolution in understanding has prompted deeper studies into how each person’s bacterial signature may influence everything from metabolism to mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts see ways to use microbiome knowledge in personalized medical plans, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;designing probiotics&lt;/a&gt; or targeted therapies for each person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers suggest that small changes, like altering meal routines, might strengthen bacterial communities that enhance metabolic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others propose monitoring microbial markers to identify subtle shifts before chronic conditions take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to probe how gut microbes connect to the brain through chemical signals, raising questions about links to mental well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators are also examining &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/secrets-of-aging-have-been-found-in-the-skin-microbiome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skin microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; to see if they affect issues like dryness or irritation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As methods for genetic analysis improve, more precise mapping of these bacterial populations may offer fresh approaches for supporting long-term health without a one-size-fits-all framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-microbiome-and-future-health"&gt;Human microbiome and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing interest in this field suggests that bacteria can influence nutrient processing. Studies look beyond the gut, revealing microbial identities in body areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variety appears vital, prompting further work on how personal bacterial communities support resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple lifestyle shifts may nurture helpful microbes, guiding approaches that honor each person’s unique health profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these microbial mysteries continue to unfold, it’s clear that our personal armies of bacteria deserve more attention in the pursuit of better, individualized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(24)00056-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell Host &amp;amp;

More than four out of 10 people diagnosed are over 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main forms of the disease — non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former accounts for eight in ten cases and is a less aggressive form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whereas the latter, small-cell lung cancer, is very aggressive and usually spreads faster. The survival rate tends to be lower for SCLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hong arrived in the US while seven months pregnant in 1965 and set up a new life for herself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lung cancer kills more than 127,000 in the US each year, figures show&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main warning signs of lung cancer can include having a persistent cough, such as one that doesn't go away after three weeks, or a long-standing cough which gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breathlessness is another common sign, as well as recurrent or lingering chest infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aches and pains when breathing or coughing, pain in your shoulder, or coughing up blood are also signs to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:03:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQNUdvU1JfQ2RXY1dGR0V1WDljODNyMVVpdkdhSDFKS3dRVkFweFF3X0RocWJoVElCcHpXckpTZHNxTkpBM1AtNkJ6N01fbXJrMVBtQk1HNHVWZVp4Ykw0VVZwSjBKeXlIUWhOelE3dGNSMnBtelExTndzTGpLQkVTcmU1TlZtTEFrQ2F0cE96MUZNeDZvbEZlZWtuWVIxQlg2WkJ5NWJmOWt0eWZoR0JWbNIBtgFBVV95cUxQdklWZHcwVWJVYXB3RWRqZnpuWnRnclByWEJadUxJOGZOM3U2NHlheXUxV2VwYXhld0xLeUU4R3liZnNSTW5LTjVQSjJ2cEl3YVllTDlZZUpkUThrdHhUYU1TR1JWekNmd1dZWmdkNC1sbDFGYkxyZDZ0Q0MtU3ZBYzEtTUZEdm9OcnRtTVQ5YW80MktBcFFiMDJCbGRIclJNMG1YZUZuQ1h3UmV5ZzBIMVQzdEdtZw</guid></item><item><title>If Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does? - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQLWlCaXdhSU5aYXM2RnlfXy1lMnRQTllVYWdqb1dJYWx4YnU1enJRVHVISGRzRkNnaUlyd0NiV214aHVXZUMzX3Z2Z200dk56dmJwdnBjdjdfVFliX1FINWNlLUtMSEp5c241NlpMTC1JWEF1OW5teTd1QTlTVklnX2lqREQ4UGJrMENKRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQLWlCaXdhSU5aYXM2RnlfXy1lMnRQTllVYWdqb1dJYWx4YnU1enJRVHVISGRzRkNnaUlyd0NiV214aHVXZUMzX3Z2Z200dk56dmJwdnBjdjdfVFliX1FINWNlLUtMSEp5c241NlpMTC1JWEF1OW5teTd1QTlTVklnX2lqREQ4UGJrMENKRQ</guid></item><item><title>Get ahead of allergy season this year - Vox</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNSExjaFlPeTVCWXM3U29CSlhtUUZVWGlUcDEyc1NoVGJ4M1pza2M3M3l6TEhpc1NUUXZGeTUxZFRVTURKUDlmbjFURHV3OFZtc3lWNG5VSFNwZDB1NTJ1a2o5OG55YlBRTFBPYXZwY3BQMnZFdUpTX21pUFF2TlUwSE5SVkppS1dtclZKTkpubzV0dHZha0JCTEZ6ZWgyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrixz"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That sneezy, itchy, watery-eyed time of year has yet again returned: it’s allergy season. Seasonal allergies are the body’s response to pollen from trees and grass; &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/seasonal-allergies"&gt;the immune system releases chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, like histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which cause all those uncomfortable, familiar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The best way to combat the unpleasant barrage is to get ahead of them, says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/person/russ-leftwich-md"&gt;Russell Leftwich&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at the &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/"&gt;American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology&lt;/a&gt; and an adjunct assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Since allergy season arrives at roughly the same time every year, Leftwich recommends starting your allergy relief of choice for a few days before pollen levels get too high. (The Weather Channel, AccuWeather, and IQAir provide local pollen monitoring.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If the dizzying variety of drugs at the pharmacy has you confused, here are a few things to know about the most effective types of over-the-counter allergy medications as well as non-pharmaceutical ways to keep your allergies in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="before-heading-to-the-drugstore" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Before heading to the drugstore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the best ways to alleviate allergy symptoms is to prevent pollen from getting into your body in the first place. This means keeping windows closed and wearing a mask while doing yard work, Leftwich says. If you’ve been outdoors for a while, &lt;a href="/even-better/24139229/allergies-seasonal-runny-nose-sneezing-eyes-itchy-watery-snot-relief"&gt;change your clothes and wash your face&lt;/a&gt; when you get home, says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/rita-kachru"&gt;Rita Kachru&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of allergy and immunology in the department of medicine at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another prevention method includes rinsing your nose with a saline solution: a mixture of baking soda, salt, and distilled or boiled water, Kachru says. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology recommends &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/saline-sinus-rinse-recipe"&gt;mixing three tablespoons of iodide-free salt&lt;/a&gt; with one teaspoon of baking soda in a small container. Then add one teaspoon of the salt/baking soda mixture to eight ounces of lukewarm distilled or boiled water. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/saline-spray"&gt;buy nasal saline sprays&lt;/a&gt; at the drugstore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="when-to-take-antihistamines" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;When to take antihistamines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When avoidance strategies aren’t totally effective, you can treat your symptoms with over-the-counter allergy medications. One of the major categories of these treatments are antihistamines, which are available in &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/antihistamines"&gt;pill, tablet, eye drop, or nasal spray forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antihistamines help reduce itchiness and sneezing and are your first line of defense, Kachru says. “The reason I always start with an antihistamine is because you may just have a day of a high pollen count,” she says, “and you just need a one-time antihistamine because you’re sneezing and you’re itchy and you’re a little congested.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kachru and Leftwich suggest opting for long-acting antihistamines — like loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or fexofenadine (Allegra) — over short-acting ones. People can develop a resistance to short-acting antihistamines, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), very quickly. Plus, Benadryl often makes people sleepy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Both short- and long-acting antihistamines provide relief within 15 to 30 minutes, Kachru says. Take them at the start of the day before you are exposed to pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For mild nose itchiness and sneezing, an antihistamine nasal spray, like azelastine (Astepro), might work for you. A common side effect is a metallic taste in the back of the throat, Kachru says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="when-to-try-nasal-steroid-sprays" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;When to try nasal steroid sprays&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you’re reaching for an antihistamine three to four times a week, Kachru suggests adding a nasal steroid into the mix. Not only do nasal steroids reduce sneezing and itchiness, but they’ll help with congestion, too. These include fluticasone (Flonase), budesonide (Benacort), triamcinolone (Nasacort), and mometasone (Nasonex). Nasal steroids do take a few days until you feel the full effects, Kachru says, so don’t give up if you don’t feel better right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To properly administer nasal sprays, insert the tip in your nostril and point it toward your ear. A common mistake when using a nasal spray is pointing it straight up your nose. “It goes up their nose, down their throat and does nothing for them,” Kachru says. “Or they stick it inwards into their nose, and then they get nosebleeds. … So you want to always make sure that when you put it in, you point it out towards your ear, spray, sniff in, and then do the alternate nostril.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While not a nasal steroid, Kachru advises against using &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18562-oxymetazoline-nasal-spray"&gt;oxymetazoline (Afrin)&lt;/a&gt;, a nasal spray decongestant. “Patients who use Afrin regularly end up having really, really severe rebound nasal congestion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After a few weeks of daily nasal spray use, you may consider stopping an antihistamine, if you’re taking both. “That’s usually what I tell people to do,” Kachru says. “Eventually just use that antihistamine as needed” because the nasal spray is more effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The protocol Kachru recommends to her patients include a daily nasal rinse and nasal steroid with an antihistamine as needed.

Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in slow-wave and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and Alzheimer’s disease, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep,” Cho said. “That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer’s supports the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Lack of deep sleep, where the brain cleans out toxins and sorts memories, can raise the risk of Alzheimer's diseasem according to a new study. - cyano66/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it’s real,” said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happens in the brain during deep sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-deprivation/how-much-sleep" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about seven to eight hours of sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about seven to eight hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt; to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults don’t get enough sleep, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cdi/indicator-definitions/sleep.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say most adults should spend &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between 20% and 25%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;between 20% and 25%&lt;/a&gt; of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/baby-sleep/baby-sleep-cycle#:~:text=Newborn%20babies%20spend%20roughly%2050,cycle%20that%20changes%20over%20time." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 50%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about 50%&lt;/a&gt; of their sleep in REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can you get more deep sleep?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get,” Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you have to do more than just lay in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there’s an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/health/sleep-longevity-study-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nearly five years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nearly five years&lt;/a&gt; to a man’s life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, however, you can’t wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can’t be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t lose hope. The good news is that you can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:easily train your brain to better sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;easily train your brain to better sleep&lt;/a&gt; by following what is called “sleep hygiene.” It’s important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you’re falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep,” Cho said. “There’s no one medicine that improves overall sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 11:10:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1QS0s5Zmh1Q2RPTzFVSEg5R21UUjdoaHdFT0lSY3I1c0thTXhONjEyRExZYUhrRlhqVnFQMU83RnlrWDhDVlFBYXhRTDlpVUVwX0dHLVF6aXJ0QS16Wm1uUXAyc0ZIaEJ5X3k1R2toZERNQQ</guid></item><item><title>The 4 Shortfall Nutrients Experts Worry Most About - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNRlhFQWVwOU1fNElobnVKZE9uZUhuSkt0bml2ck5PTXlvMm1YdF9pcnFjQTEtR3V2Nl9aZDFncjMzckJqVGlKRnhLNUE2czE5Q3RKTTBsUVVwRGZ0Qm0ta0h3b01nWEdPMEthNnlFak1HUVVROGlIM2ZfNmpVY0NrcGR5WdIBiAFBVV95cUxNbXpjODRNN3U5a3dvNUlYa295ZGV0Sl85VngxSktqSjA3dkFGSHlmMGVCY2NMd3o1N3JDT0NGQm02YjY1VVpiS2wxZlF4QnpVbEE4UXB0VXNjMXlXRGpBenRMQS0yQ2JvMGNyek5YYWZaY3hNLXU3ZFZtZEdiN2dHVW13SzNpcnVP?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re eating the way most people in America do these days, you’re probably falling short of the vital nutrients you need.

For adolescent and premenopausal females, iron is also a shortfall nutrient. Of these, four have been classified as “nutrients of public health concern” because their underconsumption has been linked in scientific literature to adverse health outcomes.

People aren’t cooking as much as they used to, and they’re snacking more instead of sitting down to meals. That adds up to more refined foods, and fewer nutrients, on the plate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The situation, for Palmer, has less to do with the sludge we’re currently consuming than with all the important things we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;aren’t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; eating: “We’re missing out on nutritious foods that are so rich in these nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We asked nutrition experts to tell us more about these “public health concern” nutrients — to find out why they’re so important and how to eat enough of them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Concern No. 1: Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nearly every nutritionist interviewed for this story led off with a plea for us to eat &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-not-enough-fiber-digestions_l_66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="more fiber" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66ba37afe4b0eabd2393b96d" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;more fiber&lt;/a&gt;, right now.

One of the reasons it’s important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. “But the foods richest in potassium — fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes — aren’t eaten enough as part of the standard American diet,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is the high sodium content in our diets. “Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren’t getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been “demonized” in some circles, Hernandez said, but they’re great sources of a vital nutrient: “A medium baked potato has 164 calories and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="952 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170030/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;&lt;span&gt;952 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 milligrams of potassium" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;422 milligrams of potassium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods, Not Pills, Will Make A Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days.

            Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00073b6mzer0z4i6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8w98h8r001b3b6ms543q2a1@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00083b6mwi0jvi4d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00093b6m5fbj68o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000a3b6m99umk2r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000b3b6m72h8dovv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000c3b6mddad3wwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000d3b6mgyhnzwiu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000e3b6m6x0p8ae0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000f3b6mad8c1rzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000g3b6m9856546b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000h3b6mngdfwh2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000i3b6m4albktm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000j3b6mam4ruvvf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000k3b6mo60xaua8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000l3b6m1pwrxjs8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html" target="_blank"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000m3b6mcalm0irp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000n3b6mfpsj9c0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000o3b6mzyzns02f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000p3b6mvaa12lo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000q3b6mwd9oz3p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000r3b6m3y7jqizm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000s3b6mpt6lxnjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000t3b6m12hta2mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" target="_blank"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000u3b6mwhpkavzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000v3b6majninky5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/" target="_blank"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn000w3b6m34wu54tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00103b6mvczsn4g3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/" target="_blank"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00113b6mzq7hx24m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8w93awn00123b6mmvew12fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/" target="_blank"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, D.C.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Since getting COVID at the end of 2020, she has been dogged by chronic fatigue and other long-term symptoms that prevent her from working or even walking to the end of her block on most days. Many of her outings involve commuting to doctors’ appointments like this one via Uber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are out, people are excited,” Alisha said. “It's like the whole world is moving and I'm not moving like them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after the pandemic first struck New York and the nation, Alisha is one of potentially hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers — researchers are unclear exactly how many there are — who are still slowed down by long COVID. Their condition is defined by symptoms that come on after an acute COVID infection and last for at least three months, and sometimes years. Although long COVID is a well-documented phenomenon, there’s still no diagnostic test to confirm its presence, meaning that symptoms are generally self-reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39693079/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; reported symptoms is chronic, debilitating fatigue. That’s often paired with a punishing condition known as post-exertional malaise — a crash that comes after too much mental or physical activity. While the risks of severe disease often fall on the very young or very old, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db480.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;people in their 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; are at highest risk for long COVID, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ We have, unfortunately, a large number of patients that cannot work,” and others who are only able to work part-time, said Dr. Fernando Carnavali, medical director of the long COVID clinic at Mount Sinai West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Summers gives Alisha a dose of NAD, a supplement that's supposed to increase her energy. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Caroline Lewis/Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians at Mount Sinai, NYU Langone and other major medical centers in the city are helping to lead the way in better understanding how long COVID works and which treatments might alleviate symptoms. Hospital-based long COVID centers direct patients to specialists and offer them ways to better manage their symptoms, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39693079/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which can include&lt;/a&gt; brain fog, shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations and a range of other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even as research advances, there are still competing theories as to the underlying causes, and no federally approved treatments are available. Some patients worry progress will falter under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/trump-administration-shuttering-office-of-long-covid-research-and-practice-00246836" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly eliminating&lt;/a&gt; a federal office dedicated to long COVID and &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/policy/research-funding/NIH-cancels-RECOVER-grants-long/103/web/2025/03" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;abruptly terminating&lt;/a&gt; some long COVID research grants, amid broader &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cuts to COVID-related funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ People are desperate for solutions,” Carnavali said, adding that patients often do their own research and experiment with remedies recommended by others online. Carnavali said his role is to help them be more strategic, and to rule out anything that might be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gothamist spoke with 10 New Yorkers with long COVID, all in their late 20s to early 40s. They said they were forced to drastically change their expectations for their careers and lives in New York City, while spending much of their time and money searching for remedies that might offer some relief. Some said they have seen improvements in their symptoms over time and have regained their previous capacity to varying degrees. Others said they are still largely bedbound and need help from spouses or other caregivers to get through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘I was hoping to progress further in my career’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Alisha can’t help but reminisce about what her life was like before long COVID. She pulls up pictures on her phone of her celebrating her 30th birthday with friends, cooking with her mom and hiking with her husband outside the city early in the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ When I think about five years, I just think about how different things would've been if I wasn't sick,” she said. “We planned to have a family. I was hoping to progress further in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Alisha takes 10 to 15 supplements daily — although she’s tried many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Caroline Lewis/Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While estimates on the number of people with long COVID vary, one &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7350a2.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;large survey&lt;/a&gt; recently published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 6% of adults in New York state were living with long COVID in 2023, similar to the national rate. That amounts to about 500,000 people with long COVID in the five boroughs alone. Of those with long COVID, about 1 in 5 reported that it limited their activities significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha said she initially kept working after getting long COVID — typically, from bed because her fatigue was so bad. But at a certain point, she said she had to give it up and go on long-term disability. Now, much of her life is dedicated to managing her health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alisha, the worst part of long COVID is the post-exertional malaise, or crash, that can come after extending herself even slightly beyond her limits. Alisha says even something simple, like watching an extra hour of TV, can set her back — a kind of “payback” for having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnavali said one of the most beneficial things he can do for patients with post-exertional malaise is teach them “structured pacing,” a practice of conserving their energy so they don’t crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha said learning to pace herself has helped make her days more predictable and improved her quality of life. But, she added, it also meant “shrinking my world really small.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Alisha reclining on her couch at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Caroline Lewis/Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She can now sometimes manage to go to a coffee shop with her husband on the weekend, or visit with family, but she said she has to save up her energy ahead of time and they always have to drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some New Yorkers with long COVID say they’ve lost friends as they’ve become more limited in what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many physical symptoms associated with long COVID, many patients are also struggling with their mental health and adjusting to having a disability, said Dr. Amanda Johnson, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/after-care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AfterCare program&lt;/a&gt; serving long COVID patients at NYC Health and Hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By and large, these are patients whose identities were not previously based around being sick, Johnson said, “so this is really challenging for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The search for relief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients who spoke to Gothamist said they’ve tried a wide range of experimental treatments and therapies to find relief, some of which are covered by insurance, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drawer in Alisha’s bedroom is packed full of dietary supplements. She takes 10 to 15 daily — although she’s tried many more. She has also been prescribed some “off-label” medications that are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but were approved for a different medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those medications is naltrexone, an injectable drug that’s approved for the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction, but which has been shown to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38267326/#full-view-affiliation-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;help relieve&lt;/a&gt; fatigue and pain for some long COVID patients when prescribed at low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rebecca Summers, Alisha’s primary care doctor, explained that to get a low dose of naltrexone, she has to go to a special compounding pharmacy that makes customized drugs, and it isn’t covered by Alisha’s insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha has also tried alternative therapies, and said she has found the most success with &lt;a href="https://traumahealing.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;somatic experiencing&lt;/a&gt;, a practice Summers offers that seeks to help people identify and relieve the effects of psychological stress and trauma on their bodies. That’s not covered by insurance, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ Nobody really knows how to treat this thing, so you're just trying different healing modalities,” Alisha said. “In the last four years, we've probably spent at least $30,000 to $40,000, if not more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha said she has help from her husband, in addition to savings and the income from her long-term disability benefits. But not everyone is in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="streamfield-pull-quote pt-4 pb-3 streamfield-pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="h3"&gt;Nobody really knows how to treat this thing, so you're just trying different healing modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="streamfield-pull-quote-author pb-4 mb-5"&gt;Alisha, long COVID patient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Fioravante, a so-called “long-hauler” in Ridgewood, Queens, is a musician and sex worker. She said some of her care is covered by her Medicaid plan, but she has also turned to GoFundMe and her mom’s church to raise money for testing and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All my extra money goes to medical care,” said Fioravante, 40, adding that she works much less than she did before developing long COVID in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients get better over time — but life might not look exactly like it did before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist Erin Durkin stopped working after getting sick in 2022, but said her symptoms have since improved enough to freelance part time. Often, she works lying down because she suffers from heart palpitations when she’s upright, but she said she’s far from bedbound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ I can go out. I can do things. I can walk around. I can take care of myself,” said Durkin, who lives in Jackson Heights, acknowledging that not all long COVID patients can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Durkin is now much more cautious than most New Yorkers when it comes to COVID, out of fear of getting reinfected and making her symptoms worse. She always masks in public and will only eat at a restaurant if there’s outdoor seating, which is becoming harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is help on the way?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are no FDA-approved treatments for long COVID yet, Brooklynite Hannah Davis said she is encouraged by the fact that there is now widespread recognition of long COVID within the medical community and a rapidly growing body of research on how it affects the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said she worries about the potential impact of Trump’s cuts to scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis, 37, first developed symptoms of long COVID after catching the virus in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic in New York. She is one of the cofounders of Patient-Led Research Collaborative, which published early findings on the symptoms associated with long COVID after surveying hundreds of people online. The group has since advocated to advance research and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ The thing we really need to be doing now is increasing clinical trials,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RECOVER Initiative, a $1.6 billion long COVID research effort funded by the National Institutes of Health, has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5199994/long-covid-patients-nih-research-treatments" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;faced criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some patients for being slow to enroll people in clinical trials. But according to the RECOVER website, &lt;a href="https://trials.recovercovid.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight trials&lt;/a&gt; are now being funded that examine 13 possible treatments and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many long COVID patients also receive other diagnoses that align with their particular symptoms, and some researchers say ongoing studies on those medical conditions could also benefit long COVID patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on Friday on which long COVID-related studies have been affected by recent cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago," HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; to NBC last week on the administration's decision to deprioritize COVID generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration is also eliminating the federal Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, which coordinates efforts across federal agencies, according to Politico. And last month, HHS was ordered to dismantle its Advisory Committee on Long COVID, made up of volunteer scientists, advocates and health practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, patients like Alisha say they are doing whatever they can to find some peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha and her husband moved to their current apartment, just a couple of blocks from Prospect Park, in 2023 in hopes the urban oasis would be accessible to her — but she’s yet to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one of her goals this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 10:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOX3BMRXFaQzdxemlFZTVyNGRzamZQVHgxNkN5Yk5tcnhfY0d3WDZWc3lhdDg3U0xJN2EwTDQxZ0tWaXRJSEJnOWRfY0ttU3pybGdxTDVzUHR5aVFQU3Q4RkZuNnE4Y1JlbFdremFzSF9QeUxhQ1hnVzJEenhvM2szRTd5R0JTMGozWWRWTUU0ZXZKdERXUHVtR25WUUduMDJ2N2JZ</guid></item><item><title>Two spice rack herbs could reverse Alzheimer's Disease and might help diabetes and heart disease - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQZUNqM0Y0SXlLTmJhWUE0cUdSam45V2k3alV6cFpyVXFXSkRPS0VDVWV6OTAwLW5xUkNoRFh1X0ZKd0xIVENBQm85T01iZExwNzVKS0dGRmhLX1FBaXRhWXN6OXlXWVg5cEZHc3FKSzZyLVVaUFdlc0dGcU9MdUIzQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The herb rosemary has long been linked with memory. Going back as far as Shakespeare's Hamlet Ophelia says.: “There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now researchers have discovered a compound found in rosemary - and in its fellow herb sage - could hold the key to reversing Alzheimer's Disease. Carnosic acid is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound that works by activating enzymes that make up the body’s natural defence system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pure carnosic acid however is too unstable to be used as a drug. But now a team of scientists from Scripps Research Institute in Calafornia have now synthesised a stable form - diAcCA - which is fully converted to carnosic acid in the gut before being absorbed into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The research, published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; showed that when diAcCA was used to treat mice, it achieved therapeutic doses of carnosic acid in the brain and led to enhanced memory. It also restored nerve connections which could help counteract the progression of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Scripps team concluded: "Collectively, these findings underscore the promise of diAcCA as a potential therapeutic for human Alzheimer's Disease." While the trials have been done in mice the compound is considered safe for humans which means the team is calling for testing on people to be "expedited".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; there are more than 944,000 people in the UK who have some form of dementia. One in 11 people over the age of 65 have dementia in the UK. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people with dementia in the UK will be more than 1 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show "dementia and Alzheimer’s disease" were the leading cause of death in the UK in 2022. Collectively they accounted for 65,967 deaths (11.4% of the total), up from 61,250 (10.4%) in 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously found brain inflammation us linked with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2012, a study funded by Alzheimer’s Research UK found a mutation in a gene called TREM2 could increase the risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the TREM2 gene makes a protein heavily involved in regulating the brain’s inflammatory response, scientists suggested that inflammation might in fact play a role in the very initial stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the Scripps team is hopeful their new drug will not only save lives but improve them. And it is hoped the drug will not have any major side-effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The study explained it had previously been difficult to use carsonic acid as a drug or supplement because of the instability of the compound. However the team had created a derivative of it which could reach the gut before breaking down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said this meant the mice absorbed 20% more carsonic acid that they would have done by trying to ingest it in it pure form. It also meant more of the compound was able to pass through the blood-brain barrier and treat the brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysis of tissue samples showed the drug also markedly decreased inflammation in the brain. The unique drug is activated by the very inflammation that it then combats and thus is only active in areas of the brain undergoing inflammatory damage and limiting the potential side effects of carnosic acid, which is on the US Food and Drug Administration’s “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) list, easing the way for clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Senior author and professor &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/lipton/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Stuart Lipton&lt;/a&gt; said the team treated the mice with the compound over the course of three months. The group examined the mice by testing their spatial learning and memory in behavioural tests and then analyzing brain tissue under the microscope. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: "We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug. And it didn’t just slow down the decline; it improved virtually back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to reducing inflammation in the brain, the scientists found it even "soothed baseline inflammation in the oesophagus and stomach as it was converted to carnosic acid". Prof Lipton sees a potential for diAcCA to work in tandem with Alzheimer’s treatments currently on the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also hoped diAcCA can be fast-tracked through clinical trials because of its safety profile.

While the drug has been a powerful tool to contain the virus, inequities remain in accessing those drugs and sustaining a daily treatment. Despite major progress, there are still 30,000 new infections each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many of the terminated HIV-related studies focused on improving access to drugs like PrEP in communities that have higher rates of infections – including trans women and Black men. One of Marcus’s projects was examining whether making PrEP available over the counter would increase the use of the drug in vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The research has to focus on the populations that are most affected in order to have an impact and be relevant,” said Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yet, this may be the justification for defunding so many HIV-related studies. A termination letter reviewed by the Guardian dated 20 March cited that “so-called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) studies are often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Scrapping an entire category of disease from research will have innumerable downstream effects on the rest of healthcare&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Erin Kahle, University of Michigan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; did not expand on why the grants were terminated in response to questions from the Guardian.

We remain dedicated to restoring our agency to its tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many researchers were left stunned by the scale of the cancellations since in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-state-union-address-2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in his State of the Union address a commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the country over the next 10 years. As part of this initiative, his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt; negotiated a deal with drug companies to provide free PrEP for 200,000 low-income patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach,” said Trump in his address. “Together we will defeat Aids in America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8ca2f65f-63f0-4233-916e-329e08f8075f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Aid cuts predicted to cause 2.9 million more HIV-related deaths by 2030 – study","elementId":"8ca2f65f-63f0-4233-916e-329e08f8075f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/26/aid-cuts-pepfar-epidemic-prediction-cause-29-million-more-hiv-related-deaths-by-2030-lancet-study"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Amy Nunn, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said she had even tailored grant proposals to fit the policy goals of the initiative, which included geographically targeting HIV prevention efforts. One of her studies that was terminated last week focused on closing disparities of PrEP use among African American men in Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“They finally adopted those policies at the federal level,” Nunn said, noting that Trump was the first president to make ending the epidemic a priority. “Now they’re undercutting their own successes. It’s so strange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The total amount of NIH funds allocated to supporting the 65 grants was $35m. Canceling the grants will not recoup all of that money for the administration, since many are years into their work. Some are even already finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nathaniel Albright learned last Tuesday that an NIH grant supporting his doctoral research was cancelled even though his project had already been completed. A PhD candidate at Ohio State University, Albright is defending his dissertation at the end of the month. Still, Albright is concerned how the cuts impact the future of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s created an environment in academia where my research trajectory is now considered high risk to institutions,” said Albright, who is currently struggling to find postdoctorate positions at universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Pamina Gorbach, an epidemiologist who teaches at University of California, Los Angeles, had been following hundreds of men living with HIV in Los Angeles for 10 years to learn their needs. She had been awarded an NIH grant to better facilitate their treatment through a local clinic. Her funding was cancelled last week as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s really devastating,” said Gorbach. “If you’re living with HIV and you’re not on meds, you know what happens?

Others agreed one immediate concern was how to pay their research staff, since the funds from a grant are immediately frozen once it is terminated.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihs001t3b73vo8tqzuo@published"&gt;Before we begin my suggestions, let me say this: This stinks—for you and them. There are all sorts of unwinnable scenarios here on both sides, but you sound like you’re the only one willing to admit there is a problem. I recognize by some of the language you’re using here that you’re probably fully fluent in the Alcoholics Anonymous program, so I won’t belabor your “not your job to fix this” realization, but let’s have those good Al-Anon vibes thrumming in the background throughout this column, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihs001u3b73bw76z3lf@published"&gt;Here’s my personal experience: My parents don’t qualify as alcoholics but do qualify as untreated Al-Anons (both of their families had a long history of drug and alcohol problems, especially on my mother’s side, which they haven’t worked through). As such, they’re masters of both denial and gaslighting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihs001v3b7321u7y10y@published"&gt;Navigating their lies, evasion, and obstinance were major obstacles for my sister and me growing up and into adulthood. They were at their worst in the past decade as my father’s cognitive decline due to dementia intersected with my mother’s cancer treatments. He insisted he was her best caregiver even though it was clear that it was a disastrous decision for him to be in charge of things. He had trouble making her appointments on time, keeping up with her meds, and communicating with her medical team. Even her oncologist was fed up and angrily called me to suggest that hospice would be the only option if someone didn’t stop my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001w3b732cdkf2mc@published"&gt;We wanted to help and do what was best, but they simply would not let us in in any meaningful way. My mother insisted that my father was doing a great job. She said that the oncologist was “crazy” and that I was out of line for discussing her private medical issues. Their short-term solution was to find a new oncologist so they could continue to avoid any disruptions to their lives, or have to think about pursuing uncomfortable solutions (even if continuing to avoid those solutions could result in one or both of their deaths). I could go into so much detail about how bad it got—we’re talking lawyers and cops and periods of estrangement—but that would only cause me agitation and result in an &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest–&lt;/em&gt;ian&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;word count.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001x3b73y9z1nqqy@published"&gt;The hardest part about having parents who are unwilling to accept help is that it felt like a cruel rejection. I’ve gone through many rejections in my life —professional, romantic, as a prospective rescue pet owner—but the yearslong saga of my mother and father being openly hostile and unwilling to accept my help cut differently. It wasn’t just about the help. All sorts of emotional baggage bubbled to the surface—I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; they didn’t love me!&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001y3b734s7ewutn@published"&gt;It is a great injustice that no one tells us when we are young: When our parents grow old, they will sometimes cause us more distress than we have ever caused them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht001z3b73zzrp2fvj@published"&gt;Fast forward to now. My father died a couple years ago. Due to my father’s erratic spending during the period when she was sick and he was cognitively declining, their once-comfortable financial situation is now severely depleted. Still, my mother resides in a pricey assisted living facility where she’s lived for years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht00203b73frqu14f0@published"&gt;According to their money manager, her savings can cover three more years of living there. Given her track record of remarkable resilience, she has the potential to live another 15. If she does live that long, I don’t think she’s up for driving for Uber between naps to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9ciht00213b73ryiytj6w@published"&gt;When I first heard about her finances, I immediately went to the emotional place where you are. First stop: Angry Town. Then, Sad City. That’s when I knew that I needed help. Before I brought it up to her, I consulted my therapist, my sister, my aunt, my wife, and my Al-Anon fellowship about how I should proceed. Through all those conversations, I finally landed on the best approach: wait until the moment is right. I knew it would come eventually, but it couldn’t begin with me inviting her into a hard conversation. She’d recognize the tone, get annoyed, and then I’d get mad. Then we’d have the same conversation again next year and probably have the same result. The best thing for me to do was keep my contact to a minimum, be there when something big and dramatic happens, and then go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihu00223b73myfpzajc@published"&gt;Finally, a few days ago, it came up. She called to speak to her grandchildren and after that was over we began to talk about her health and some of the costs associated with her next cancer screening—the copays were expensive and hinted that she may not be able to afford another bout with cancer. Then I gave her the news about how much longer she could afford to live at her facility, and I calmly relayed to my mother that she was running out of money. I added that whatever she wanted to do, I’d be happy to help her work through it. I can’t afford to pay her rent, but I offered to let her live with us or help her find a cheaper place. I told her I preferred we start planning before she gets evicted.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihu00233b73m9wzlkmm@published"&gt;The one thing I avoided was berating her about the past. I know you want to talk to your parents about how their denial has affected you over the years, but maybe I’d avoid it. I remember how it felt when my parents would try to urge me to get some help with drugs and alcohol by explaining how much it hurt them—or worse, how they were ashamed of me—and that approach never worked. I certainly wasn’t going to stop my drinking and drug use because it made them feel bad. I mean—it made &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; feel good. It made me feel normal. I knew no other way.&lt;/p&gt;

Time to accept that.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihu00253b73uakxop16@published"&gt;But on that note, it’s entirely reasonable that you ask them to not be drunk and disruptive while they’re visiting you and your kids. (I addressed a similar situation about setting these types of boundaries with a reader about&lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/12/parenting-advice-my-daughters-auntie-makes-poor-choices.html"&gt; their friend’s drug use around their child&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

But in the meantime, let’s find a more peaceful way to exist with them. Line up a solid group of sponsors, friends, and relatives who can listen and guide you through your emotional responses. Before your parents come over to your house—call one of them. Before you decide on a dramatic course of action—call one of them. Write dozens of emails to your parents—but never send them. Then call one of them. Ask them how they’re doing. On your boundaries, be clear, firm, and kind—let them know you are truly happy to have them over and serve them seltzers with lime.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t9cihv00273b73u7mnvjik@published"&gt;Maybe your parents will come around. Maybe my mom will come around. We’ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From differences at the cellular level of the heart to circulatory structure to symptoms of distress and treatment, researchers are finding new manifestations of gender differences in cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459463/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;look different in women&lt;/a&gt; than in stereotypically chest-clutching men, sending more diffuse pain shooting through the jaw, neck, arm, back, stomach, and more, all in ways that don’t scream “call 911.” Even where in the body a heart attack blocks blood flow is different: Microvessels in women get jammed, but it’s the larger arteries in men that starve the heart of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number and function of muscle cells in the heart differ, too. Women’s hearts have more cardiomyocytes than men, and their fuel tends to be more fatty acids as opposed to the sugars that male muscle cells prefer to burn, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071973" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; reveals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All these differences have implications for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet it is not lost on researchers that the nuances of women’s physiology have taken decades to be uncovered, and that now, any research on gender differences faces &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/nih-puts-former-sexual-and-gender-minority-office-employees-on-administrative-leave/"&gt;special scrutiny or roadblocks by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I think part of the reason, perhaps, that we don’t have the studies in sex differences or cardiovascular disease in women is because there aren’t enough women researchers and women in leadership,” said Esther Kim, director of the Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Health, Atrium Health, and professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. She was chair of an American Heart Association writing group that earlier this month issued a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001310" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scientific statement&lt;/a&gt; on sex differences in peripheral vascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That statement has long been in the works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was not some sort of rush job in response to the current administration at all. It’s unfortunate that we have to think about things like that even when this goes out,” she said. “But, you know, it’s science. Women deserve better and women deserve more.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a moment when research into women’s health is under threat in the United States as a casualty of outlawed diversity efforts, learning more about the basic biology and the clinical outcomes of disease takes on more urgency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sex and gender should not just be a niche specialist area of science, but something that all scientists who study animals or humans or cells have to consider,” Madeline Wood Alexander, a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Research Institute whose &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/05/alzheimers-dementia-in-women-explored-special-edition-health-journal-science/"&gt;paper was recently published in a special issue of Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; exploring women’s health. “In the current political climate, we need to be doing better, and to be a good scientist is to consider all of the factors that contribute to health and disease outcomes. And really, the bare minimum is considering sex differences in 50% of the population that has been historically understudied.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying that half of the population means unraveling societal influences as well as more basic variations under the microscope that may exist along with broader influences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we think about male-female differences in, for example, heart disease, we can quite rightly focus on things like access to care and differences in symptoms and issues of health equity,” said David Page, member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT professor of biology. “I don’t mean to deny the relevance of any of those. I mean to add another consideration: There can exist fundamental biochemical or molecular differences between male and female cells of the same type and tissues of the same type prior to any disease process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vascular-variance"&gt;Vascular variance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence has built in recent years of significant gender differences in how vascular diseases strike the blood vessels, from risk factors to diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The need to better recognize those variations led to the new American Heart Association guidelines delineating what is and isn’t the same in diseases cropping up in the peripheral arteries, including the aorta and its branch vessels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TV commercials hammer us about heart attacks and strokes, said Kim, who is also director of the Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in Charlotte, N.C. But few ads talk about aneurysm rupture (when a weakened blood vessel bursts open) or claudication (the cramping leg pain caused by narrowed arteries). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worse for women looking for a solution to their vascular pain. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peripheral vascular disease: &lt;/strong&gt;“Patients may present in a, quote, atypical manner, compared to the man,” said Kim. “It’s not the classic leg pain when you walk that goes away with rest that we learn in medical school. It could be pain at rest. It could be pain that occurs with exertion, but we can work through it. And that may be different than in men.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If their subtle or “atypical” symptoms are missed or diagnosed only after a delay, women can miss out on treatment and fare worse, only able to walk more slowly and for shorter distances. In another disparity, a Black woman’s lifetime risk of 27.6% is higher than a white woman’s risk of 19%, yet chances are lower for a Black woman to receive recommended treatment, the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001251" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AHA determined in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diseases affecting the aorta&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s the largest artery in the body and the one that delivers blood from the heart to the body. For aortic diseases, women are diagnosed later in life and at a more severe stage of disease. While estrogen protects the aorta from aneurysms, when one occurs it’s more severe than in men. Ruptures are three times more likely in women with an aneurysm the same size as a man’s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a woman is treated with a minimally invasive procedure, her chances of dying or having a stroke are higher. Screening guidelines for aortic aneurysms recommend lower repair thresholds for women than for men, but these thresholds may not fully reflect women’s unique risk factors, the AHA statement says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carotid artery disease:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the blood vessel snaking up your neck to the brain. When its walls are blocked by fatty plaque, it can lead to a stroke, but treatment options and outcomes are different for men and women. Preeclampsia, which is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy, as well as older age at menopause and estrogen therapy are risk factors for women. But studies have shown that men have bleeding with these fatty deposits at higher rates than women, elevating the stroke risk for men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vasculitis:&lt;/strong&gt; An autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the blood vessels, vasculitis has different types with different effects at different ages. Like other autoimmune diseases, it occurs more frequently in women. Some types have higher mortality rates in women as well as more treatment challenges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zooming-in-on-chromosomes"&gt;Zooming in on chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page’s research goes right to the heart of sex differences: our X and Y chromosomes, plus their underappreciated “inactive” versions. Some sex differences are biologically hard-wired, and Page would argue that male-female differences in health and disease will ultimately find their origins in the sex chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While X and Y chromosomes may matter the most in the reproductive organs, their activity diverges elsewhere in the body. We all learned in science class that males have one X and one Y chromosome while females have two X chromosomes. It’s been assumed that the Y is less important and the second X, called Xi, is inactive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not so. That Xi has to be prepared to support pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And both X chromosomes matter in the heart. For starters, there are proportionally more cardiomyocytes — what Page calls the hardest-working cells in the body — in the female heart compared to male hearts. During pregnancy, the heart works 50% harder to keep blood circulating. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Pumping is important not only in pregnancy but also in end-stage heart disease. Page calls heart failure an energy crisis: The heart is pumping inefficiently and can’t generate enough energy to meet the body’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart failure plays out differently, too. Men are diagnosed with the disorder much more frequently and die more often and earlier than women. Page led a team that discovered male and female hearts have a basic biochemical difference in their power source. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re essentially reporting that in the central engine room, the female cardiomyocytes prefer to burn fatty acids a bit more than do male cardiomyocytes, which might be a little more inclined to burning sugar,” he said about a research paper &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071973" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in February in Circulation&lt;/a&gt;. “So it’s as if we’re pointing to a difference in the fuel mix.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That difference could potentially lead to better prevention and treatment for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zooming-out-to-post-operative-care"&gt;Zooming out to post-operative care&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, researchers reported on a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/16/women-survival-cardiovascular-surgery-complications/"&gt;“failure to rescue,”&lt;/a&gt; when a patient dies from complications after surgery that might have been averted if recognized and treated. Differences between male and female patients may explain why women are less likely to survive high-risk cardiovascular surgery than men, the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2024.4574?guestAccessKey=cfdcf654-1f12-478b-87e6-7928faf2dc83&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=101624" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Surgery&lt;/a&gt; paper concluded.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After four common but serious procedures —  abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass surgery, or aortic or mitral valve replacements — female patients later developed complications at the same rate as men. But these women were more likely to die within 30 days than men with the same serious post-op problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do suspect that one of the key reasons is that the diagnostic algorithms in the treatment for their complications are the same for men and women, but they should not be the same,” said Mario Gaudino, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who studies cardiac surgery outcomes and who was not involved in the study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts traced the disparate outcomes back to whether a woman was diagnosed late in her disease. Being smaller with smaller blood vessels could make surgery take more time and recovery more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-now"&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association’s Kim takes the long view as she calls for more attention to the women-aren’t-just-small-men conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Before you fix something, you have to figure out what the problem is and the scope of the problem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, she zeroed in on three areas of need in her field. One is medical education. In cardiology training, new M.D.s don’t learn as much about vascular disease as cardiac disease. “We’ll know how to order stress tests, echos, EKGs, etc., but we’re also supposed to know how to interpret an ankle brachial index,” which compares blood pressure in the ankle to blood pressure in the arm in order to detect blockages in the legs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another gap is inclusion of women in clinical trials testing devices designed to repair vascular problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We definitely have different anatomy. Our vessels are smaller. Women tend to present with more severe disease,” Kim said. “In these device trials, including in aneurysm trials, we’ve shown that compared to the prevalence, women are underrepresented.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s screening of patients to spot trouble early enough to treat it — and determining if that’s the best course.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For aneurysmal disease in particular, there’s still a little bit of clarification that needs to come in regards to when should a woman get an aneurysm fixed,” she said about the size of the aneurysm. “Because we tend to be shorter, our aortas are smaller. Should we really wait until 5 and a half centimeters? You know, my aorta is a lot smaller than Shaquille O’Neal’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

This means that hospitals can use the technology to input information about their patient’s symptoms without exposing private data to a wider network for the first time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Thomas A. Buckley, a student in Harvard’s AI in Medicine Ph.D. program and first author of the study, “open-source models unlock new scientific research because they can be deployed in a hospital’s own network”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One major implication of the study is that researchers “can now use state-of-the-art clinical AI directly with patient data,” wrote Buckley. “Hospitals can use patient data to develop custom models (for example, to align with their own patient population).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arjun K. Manrai ’08, a professor at HMS who supervised the study, called the fact that open source models could perform on par with GPT-4 “pretty remarkable.” But he noted that medical researchers previously struggled to use the model “in the real world” because of concerns about patient privacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Buckley said he was drawn to the topic by a 2023 paper that highlighted GPT’s performance on some of the most difficult cases from the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This paper got a ton of attention and basically showed that this large language model, ChatGPT, could somehow solve these incredibly challenging clinical cases, which kind of shocked people,” said Buckley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These cases are notoriously difficult,” he added. “They’re some of the most challenging cases seen at the Mass General Hospital, so they’re scary to physicians, and it’s equally scary when an AI model could do the same thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Buckley said that when Llama 3.1 405B was released last year, the sheer magnitude of its 405 billion parameters — or values the model uses to make predictions — seemed to have a lot of potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It was kind of the first time where we considered, oh, maybe there’s something really different happening in open-source models,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manrai said the research “unlocks and opens up a lot of new studies and trials,” since it allows hospitals to safely use patient data in real time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“With these open source models, you can bring the model to the data, as opposed to sending your data to the model,” Manrai said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Manrai and Buckley said that while the AI diagnostic process is promising, humans are still needed to verify the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our clinical collaborators have been really important, because they can read what the model generates and assess it qualitatively,” Buckley said. “These results are only trustworthy when you can have them assessed by physicians.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manrai said in a March 14 press release that AI tools “could be invaluable copilots for busy clinicians” when “used wisely and incorporated responsibly in current health infrastructure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But it remains crucial that physicians help drive these efforts to make sure AI works for them,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;—Staff writer Kaitlyn Y.

Bush, PEPFAR is credited with drastically reducing global deaths from HIV/AIDS. The bipartisan initiative has provided antiretroviral medications to more than 20 million people globally, making it one of the most successful U.S. foreign aid programs in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But with recent political shifts, the future of PEPFAR’s funding hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If Congress decides to cut funding for PEPFAR, people will not receive their medication. The virus will rebound. Infections will multiply. Millions will die,” the artists write. “And, the epidemic will grow exponentially worldwide — including a potential explosion in our own backyards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The letter emphasizes both the humanitarian and strategic importance of continued investment in the program: “This isn’t just the smart thing to do — for national security, economic, and public health reasons — this is the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Also lending support is Dr. Bill Frist, the former U.S. Senate Majority Leader and a Middle Tennessee resident who played a key role in passing PEPFAR legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“PEPFAR is the ultimate example of American exceptionalism and compassion,” he said in a statement. “If we back away from this historic, bipartisan commitment to those less fortunate, we are ceding ground to China… and we are turning our back on a successful diplomatic strategy that has fostered unlikely allies, stabilized nations, and strengthened our place in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fans and advocates are encouraged to visit &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.one.org" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ONE.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;ONE.org&lt;/a&gt; to send letters of their own to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other artists who signed the letter include Brandy Clark, Brittney Spencer, Cam, Cassadee Pope, Drew and Ellie Holcomb, Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush of Sugarland, Kix Brooks of Brooks &amp;amp; Dunn, and Mickey Guyton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best of Billboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://cloud.email.billboard.com/signup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Billboard's Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Billboard's Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.
