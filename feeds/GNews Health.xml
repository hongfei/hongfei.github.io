While most can control their asthma with inhalers to treat immediate symptoms and preventive ones to reduce inflammation, those with the most severe asthma often take daily doses of oral corticosteroids as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But long-term use is associated with serious health conditions, including osteoporosis, diabetes and increased vulnerability to infections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Now an &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(25)00359-5/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;international clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; has found that participants who received injections of &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta880" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tezepelumab&lt;/a&gt; every four weeks were able to reduce or even stop taking their steroids entirely with no ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Tezepelumab, also known as Tezspire and made by AstraZeneca, binds to and blocks a protein associated with airway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="353334d6-5a0c-4059-850a-712c0a8a34b0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Antibiotic resistance: how a pioneering trial is using old drugs to save babies from sepsis","elementId":"353334d6-5a0c-4059-850a-712c0a8a34b0","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/25/antibiotic-resistance-trial-kemri-old-drugs-babies-newborn-sepsis"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The National Institute for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Care Excellence approved the drug in 2023 as an additional maintenance treatment for patients over 12 whose usual medication does not control their asthma well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Wayfinder trial, led by Kings College London, involved just under 300 adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were taking 5mg-40mg of steroid tablets daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patients, from 11 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, were given tezepelumab every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After one year of treatment, more than half of the participants had stopped taking their steroid medication altogether without their asthma flaring up, while nearly 90% had reduced their steroid use to a low dose. A third had stopped taking steroids after six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness. Up to 10% of asthmatics have severe disease and, in the most extreme cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial findings, published in the the Lancet Respiratory Medicine and presented at the British Thoracic Society winter meeting, also showed that tezepelumab significantly improved asthma symptoms, lung function and overall quality of life. During the study, two-thirds of patients did not have any asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, prof David Jackson, who is a respiratory medicine expert at King’s College London and asthma services clinical lead at Guy’s and Royal Brompton hospitals, said: “As tezepelumab also suppresses allergy-related symptoms and improves chronic rhinosinusitis as well, the results are particularly exciting for patients with severe asthma who suffer with both upper and lower airway symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/asthma" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Asthma&lt;/a&gt; + Lung UK, said: “This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s vital that research into new types of treatment continues, but we know current funding for lung health research is on life support, despite lung conditions remaining the third biggest cause of death in the UK. Studies like this show the positive impact that research can make on providing potentially life-changing treatment for people with asthma and other lung conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Any new interventions that may help patients manage their symptoms more easily and in a safe and effective way would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The prospect of a monthly injection, rather than daily tablets, may also be a more manageable treatment option for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As with any emerging research, it’s important the findings are carefully assessed and considered as clinical guidelines, which GPs use in their daily practice, are developed and updated, based on the latest evidence to ensure safety and benefit for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 23:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNeTRhZ1hmV3JCNzIyQThoM0FYeTQ4eDN0cDNOeUFqYmhqU29KenljeXM2aGdEVUJocmxZN2pjWHJ4VVp4TDczM1VCMldZbVdVanBUX2I2QmZxMlRHT2NGcjBTbGw5UVFlYW5TU19xa2Eyc0s0T0l3c3JfbHU5b0R4Q1ZhZjUzQ1lUUnhiSk0yd3lzMV9PREo4eS1lbGFyUU9LSHdaVU85SjZIT3VPT2l2NTJVWVo</guid></item><item><title>国际传播的突变型流感病毒株可能在加利福尼亚州起飞- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/california/article/mutated-influenza-may-take-off-california-21208372.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Utah experts advise a radon test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think about family history, genetics, or age when they think about Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those factors are well known, researchers are now studying whether long-term exposure to certain environmental conditions may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those conditions is radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas found throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah health and environmental experts encourage residents to pay attention to radon levels in their homes, especially because radon exposure builds slowly over time and can go unnoticed for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test kit at &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_top" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon forms naturally as uranium in soil and rock breaks down. It moves upward and can enter homes through small openings in foundations, basements, crawl spaces and utility gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon has no color, taste, or odor, so homeowners cannot detect it without a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the [Envionmental Protection Agency](Envionmental Protection Agency), long-term radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has a higher radon potential than many other states due to its unique geology. Recent data shows that almost half of all Utah homes have elevated radon levels, underscoring the importance of routine testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do we know about Alzheimer's risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients are 65 and older, and the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. Genetics, family history and certain heart and blood vessel conditions may also contribute to increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Beaunitta Van Wyk/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say about radon and cognitive health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to study whether long-term exposure to radon may affect neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671130/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Environmental Health Perspectives found evidence that ionizing radiation may contribute to cellular changes associated with Alzheimer's. The authors noted that these effects may accumulate over many years of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more studies are needed before drawing firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because radon exposure is preventable, Utah residents have an opportunity to reduce one potential environmental risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is simple. Families can order a free test kit from &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_mid" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why radon testing matters for Utah families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Utah homeowners who test their homes are surprised by their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon has no symptoms and no noticeable signs, homes with elevated levels often appear completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is straightforward. UtahRadon.org provides free test kits to all Utah residents. The test only takes a few minutes to place in the home and is then mailed to a certified third-party laboratory for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If your home tests high&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels can be reduced by installing a mitigation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are installed by certified professionals and are designed to continuously vent radon from beneath the home to the outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most installations are completed in a single visit and begin lowering radon levels immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is invisible and odorless, but it is measurable, and homeowners have control over their exposure. Testing allows families to understand their risk and take action if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test by visiting &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_bottom" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it.

New research suggests simpler physical therapies can give stronger relief with fewer risks for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study of thousands of patients points to knee braces, warm water therapy, and structured exercise as top options for knee arthritis. These approaches work without adding new drugs and help people climb and walk with less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-osteoarthritis-and-pills"&gt;Osteoarthritis and pills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with osteoarthritis, a joint disease that slowly damages cartilage and limits movement, are told to manage pain with pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, about 528 million people live with osteoarthritis and roughly 365 million have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oregano-herb-helps-reduce-and-prevent-joint-pain-from-arthritis/"&gt;knee involvement&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Yuan Luo, a rehabilitation specialist at the First People’s Hospital of Neijiang in southwest China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo’s research focuses on comparing non drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis to help patients avoid unnecessary medication side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with knee arthritis rely on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547742/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NSAIDs&lt;/a&gt;), medicines that reduce inflammation but can harm the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs also raise concerns about kidney stress and heart problems when used for long periods, particularly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5772852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of NSAID use in people over 60 found higher rates of serious gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney injury among regular users. That work also tied long term NSAID exposure to more cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-study-did-differently"&gt;What this study did differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of testing one treatment at a time, Luo’s team compared many therapies at once. They used a network meta-analysis, a method that combines results from many trials, so treatments can be ranked together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the comparison, researchers pooled 139 trials that tested 12 non-drug options for knee osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those trials examined laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, taping, ultrasound, hydrotherapy, and several exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined standard rating scales that scored pain, stiffness, and day to day function. Those scores let them estimate which options worked best overall without letting any single small study dominate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions,” said Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-braces-shift-the-load"&gt;How braces shift the load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A knee brace for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; is usually a rigid or semi rigid device that wraps around the joint. By changing how body weight passes through the knee, the brace can take pressure off the worn compartment and reduce irritation of sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical research on unloader braces, rigid supports that relieve pressure from one side of the knee, shows clear short term pain relief. Several trials also report better function and longer walking distance when people use these braces consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overview of 14 brace studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6028281/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that many users experienced better overall quality of life while they wore the device. The authors also found early signs that bracing could delay knee replacement for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braces have drawbacks, including bulk, skin irritation, and the hassle of wearing them for hours per day. Real world studies suggest many people stop using their brace or wear it only briefly, so comfort and fit can influence success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-water-and-exercise-matter"&gt;Why water and exercise matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrotherapy involves guided exercise in warm water that supports body weight and lets joints move with less impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955208/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of aquatic exercise programs found that water based sessions reduce pain and joint dysfunction for people with osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those benefits were especially clear for participants who struggled to tolerate land based workouts because of pain or poor balance. In Luo’s ranking, hydrotherapy rose to the top when a combined arthritis score was used, capturing gains in pain, stiffness, and daily function together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits reports from pool programs that work with older adults who have knee arthritis. In warm water, they can practice balance, strength, and walking drills without the sharp jolts they feel on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land based exercise also remains a central part of care for people with knee osteoarthritis. Walking, strengthening, simple balance drills, supervised sessions, and support for weight and self management are all strongly recommended in major clinical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-treatment"&gt;What this means for treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ranking supports a model where braces, exercise, and hydrotherapy sit at the center of long term care. In that approach, medications are used carefully as add ons, not the automatic first line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these physical treatments shift load, strengthen muscles, and retrain movement patterns, they aim at causes of pain rather than only numbing signals. That focus on mechanics and strength can matter more than short courses of pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International bodies now encourage combinations of non drug and drug therapies tailored to each person with knee symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibiofemoral bracing and structured exercise sit among the most strongly endorsed options for painful knee osteoarthritis. Practical care plans often layer a brace for high demand activities with regular supervised exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pool time when available and short courses of medication during symptom flares are added instead of escalating straight to injections or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-to-learn-about-osteoarthritis"&gt;More to learn about osteoarthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/womans-knee-pain-caused-by-the-presence-of-gold-threads-in-her-joints/"&gt;knee arthritis&lt;/a&gt; can ask their clinician whether an unloading brace or a supervised exercise program is appropriate for their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also ask about referral to aquatic therapy when their balance, weight, or other conditions make land exercise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about brace fit, how many hours to wear it, and which exercises are safe help tailor treatment and may improve comfort and adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific goals, such as hiking, kneeling, or climbing stairs for work, can guide which therapies deserve the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still need longer studies that follow brace users and exercise participants over several years. Those trials could reveal whether these approaches delay joint replacement and remain cost effective as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo and colleagues also note that combinations of therapies, such as bracing plus hydrotherapy, could prove more powerful than any single option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust trials of those treatment packages are still rare, so the best mix and timing remain open questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0324864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

Between August and November 2024, there were 235 reported norovirus outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96bef7" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been 153 outbreaks during the same time period this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ec07" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the same level of illnesses will continue into 2026, but outbreaks are expected to keep rising, Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-182ed6" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have three years of data to kind of show that we have this strong seasonal pattern,” she said. “But I can’t say right now how big of a peak it will be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2b81" class="body-graf"&gt;A CDC spokesperson said the agency is closely monitoring the norovirus season, which is most common from November to April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aef629" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC tracks norovirus through voluntary reporting from clinical laboratories and health departments, but doesn’t currently monitor for norovirus through wastewater, which may be a reason its tracking doesn’t match the WastewaterScan data. People may be sick, but not go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2725b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bidwell said wastewater is an “unbiased way of looking at what is happening in a community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a409e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s what to know about norovirus and its spread this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d5e34" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus variant becoming more dominant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aabe29" class="body-graf"&gt;For over 30 years, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" target="_blank"&gt;norovirus outbreaks have been dominated by one strain&lt;/a&gt;, GII.4. Last year’s outbreaks were &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank"&gt;overwhelmingly caused&lt;/a&gt; by the variant GII.17, making up around 75% of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c987" class="body-graf"&gt;The GII.17 strain has become more prevalent in several countries, including the United States, through the 2020s. The rise of GII.17 may explain why the 2024 spikes and this year’s spread started earlier in October, instead of winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b60133" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said a combination of factors may have led to GII.17’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-033782" class="body-graf"&gt;“The two possibilities is that something in the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or there were changes in the population that a larger proportion were susceptible,” he said. “And probably it’s a combination of both. But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ea117" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Craig Wilen, associate professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology at Yale University, said GII.17 may not actually be more transmissible, but many people probably have less immunity to the new variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-463d92" class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably the GII.17 last year was so effective at infecting so many people because we had significantly less immunity to that virus, since it was different enough from viruses that we’ve previously been infected with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fa9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s difficult to say how this year’s norovirus season will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28da7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Atmar said either variant has a “50/50 chance” of dominating this year, but doesn’t expect the same level of illnesses as last year because of “increased immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-82a035" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus symptoms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1eb627" class="body-graf"&gt;Norovirus is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious&lt;/a&gt;, human-only disease. Norovirus outbreaks can happen anywhere and cause around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;20 million infections&lt;/a&gt; a year. It’s responsible for over half of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-089da0" class="body-graf"&gt;It spreads from person to person through vomit or feces drops that end up in peoples’ mouths. It can also spread through coming in contact with contaminated food, water or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419a39" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;main symptoms &lt;/a&gt;are diarrhea and vomiting, earning it the name “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-treatment-guide-effective-methods-protection-rcna185872" target="_blank"&gt;two-bucket disease&lt;/a&gt;.” Other symptoms include fever, stomach pain and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac533" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea may require medical attention for older adults, young children and people with weakened immune systems, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4a90c" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually start within 12 to 48 hours after exposure and last for a few days. Someone can still spread the virus for more than two weeks, even after symptoms are gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-687185" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect against norovirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54d0d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Norovirus is notoriously difficult to kill. &lt;/a&gt;It’s difficult to wash away and can survive temperatures up to 145°F. Many scientists call it the “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/205/11/1622/844989?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank"&gt;perfect pathogen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-771edb" class="body-graf"&gt;Wilen said norovirus is “highly stable in the environment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-781fa2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s highly infectious. Traditional ethanol-based hand sanitizers don’t work as well for this virus as they do for other viruses,” the Yale associate professor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-718222" class="body-graf"&gt;In order to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;kill norovirus&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC recommends washing your hands vigorously with soap, cleaning infected areas with diluted bleach and washing infected clothes with hot water and detergent. Wearing gloves and throwing them out after cleaning adds protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea55ee" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruits and vegetables should be properly cleaned, and oysters and shellfish are properly cooked can also reduce infection risk, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-384c28" class="body-graf"&gt;There isn’t a specific treatment for norovirus, but &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355302" target="_blank"&gt;rehydration is key to replace lost fluids&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f6aa3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Though there’s currently no vaccine for norovirus, a &lt;a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-1403-P301" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 3 Moderna trial is in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:02:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNS0VTZF9xeFVJaVR3NHJIdEdvazNIbDRNLU5DVGtyLUNzTFNFZW4weE1SS1JGekRadVJUb25ZejJrZFh1Q2tCemp6RjhmZ3BWMlAzck9JUHphSng5OEZqNzNaTXJzemNyV3NRaVVQbUd0ZlZmYmttOWpUUHFZZHhIQk5RM1FvbmVleFdjOTltR2w3VFJtVkc0VHM4ZFBHUnE0Wk1RT2dnZ2dmdFZkd25pMGN0OVhORjZxc3fSAVZBVV95cUxPeHVYOUdNcjF3U183dW92THZaVVNsaWxDYUJrQkxqdWRDT3piZEd5Y1Bic1ZEeTlCRzZVNnpPZnJROU5zQmxHMGl4d1JFSUxQaUNzMWFTdw</guid></item><item><title>早期发现癌症的新方法带来了希望和问题—《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/26/metro/cancer-detection-early-dana-farber/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many cancer doctors hope that tests like Galleri, which are sometimes called &lt;a href="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;“liquid biopsies,”&lt;/a&gt; will transform cancer care by detecting the earliest signs of malignancy, enabling treatment before the disease becomes deadly. They are part of an accelerating effort to find cancer earlier and earlier, through blood tests as well as new techniques and artificial intelligence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The goal is to take the same energy and skill that has been deployed to develop treatments for cancer, and put it to work at finding cancer early enough to stop it in its tracks, said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Clinic at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“How do we move from a reactive model where we are only picking up cancers when they declare themselves?” she said. O’Donnell is leading &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/clinical-trials/24-070" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of the Galleri test, recruiting 1,000 people at high risk for cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today, 70 percent of cancers have no screening test. People can be screened for cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, and, for heavy smokers, lung. Other tumors often grow without symptoms and are discovered when it’s too late to effectively treat them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The path to catching more cancers early is fraught with challenges. To be most effective, screening has to do more than just detect cancer: It has to find the right cancer at the right moment. When a test turns up cancer so indolent it was never going to harm the patient, it only sows fear and can lead to needless procedures. When it finds a cancer that is so aggressive there’s no stopping it, its value can be limited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You really want a screening test that finds the cancer and leads to the patient not dying,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, a noted expert in cancer prevention and control at Johns Hopkins University, who has consulted for GRAIL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When Burns White, 66, of Randolph, returned from the jazz festival, she was not immediately concerned. She’d been told that more often than not, a positive result from Galleri proves to be a false alarm. Her primary care doctor told her not to worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the result was pretty specific: It said cancer might be lurking in her breast, esophagus, and stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So Burns White consulted with doctors from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she works in community outreach and engagement. Two years ago, the hospital launched its &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/early-detection-interception" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Early Detection and Interception&lt;/a&gt;, which works with patients at high risk of cancer, those who receive troubling results from liquid biopsies, and others who learn of hard-to-interpret abnormalities from tests done for another purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White endured an endoscopy, an uncomfortable procedure involving threading a tube with a camera down her throat. The result was good news: no cancer of the esophagus or stomach. It would be a different story for breast cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A mammogram she had taken a few months before had detected masses — but they looked benign. The results of the GRAIL test “pushed us to look closer,” said O’Donnell, of Dana-Farber. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White underwent another set of mammograms, followed by MRIs and biopsies of both breasts. Doctors told her she had triple-negative breast cancer, a form that can be difficult to treat but that was still at an early stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Multicancer blood tests eventually will “change the face of early detection for cancer,” said Timothy R. Rebbeck, professor of cancer prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But they still need more work because, while they catch some cancers at an early stage, others are missed, he said. And even a screening tool that saves lives can have costs: follow-up testing and sometimes needless treatment, as well as “the psychosocial costs of having to go through all of this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Recent preliminary &lt;a href="https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2025/attendee/confcal/presentation/list?q=Galleri" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;results from the largest study of GRAIL’s Galleri test&lt;/a&gt; showed its promise and limitations. Galleri found many types of cancer for which there is no screening test, and 92 percent of the time it correctly identified where in the body the cancer originated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test was administered to 36,000 people aged 50 and older. Among the first 25,000 analyzed, Galleri&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found a “cancer signal” in 216 cases — and cancer was confirmed in 133, about 60 percent. That compares favorably with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq#_80_toc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mammography&lt;/a&gt;, said Megan P. Hall, vice president of medical and corporate affairs at GRAIL; she cited data showing that when a woman is called back for a follow-up mammogram, only 4 to 5 percent turn out to have cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were more false negatives than true positives — 196 people were told the test found no cancer but went on to develop it within the next year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, even though its purpose is early detection, nearly half the cancer cases the test found were already advanced. That’s because advanced cancers shed more DNA and are easier to pick up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The endgame in early detection may come down to better defining who is most at risk and thus most likely to benefit from screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, pancreatic cancer is almost always detected at an advanced stage. But it’s so rare that it would make no sense to screen everybody. Researchers are looking for ways to identify a subset of high-risk people who would benefit from screening,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Limor Appelbaum, a staff scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/24/metro/ai-predict-pancreatic-cancer/?p1" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;deploying AI&lt;/a&gt; to comb through the medical records of millions of patients, looking for patterns common among those who went on to develop pancreatic cancers, such as changes in blood chemistry or more frequent doctor’s visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Dana-Farber, researchers have identified one possible warning sign of pancreatic cancer: muscle loss. By studying blood samples from people who developed pancreatic cancer going back years before their diagnosis, and also looking at CT scans, researchers led by Dr. Brian Wolpin and Dr. Michael H. Rosenthal found evidence that the pancreas starts to falter, performing its key functions less well, long before any tumor forms. This weakens the body’s ability to absorb proteins in the diet, causing it to break down muscle. But many factors can cause muscle loss, so further study is needed before these measures can be put to use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors are working on a warning system for lung cancer. An AI program called Sybil scanned thousands of chest X-rays of people who were later diagnosed with the disease and learned the patterns seen before someone develops cancer in the lung, said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director of the &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/treatments-and-services/cancer-early-detection" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic&lt;/a&gt; at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“My vision for 25 years from now,” said Dana-Farber’s O’Donnell, “is that when you go to your primary care physician’s appointment, they say, ‘This is your risk score, and here are the screening tests you need.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who calls himself a “healthy skeptic” of cancer screening, would like to see the opposite: “If you want to lower the burden on patients,” he said, “develop the test that tells people they’re at low risk for cancer and [can] stop worrying about it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for Burns White, she’s happy with how the Galleri test played out for her. Once her breast cancer was diagnosed, she underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Today, a little over a year since her diagnosis, she continues to take a medication aimed at eradicating the remaining cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through it all, Burns White continued to work, taking off only a few days for the surgery. She expects her treatment to end in mid-December. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I remain strong and optimistic,” she said, “and grateful to have had access to treatment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

The researchers found that, in 28 days, people in the urolithin A group had changes in biomarkers associated with age-related immune decline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A leads to better cell function, but it also has a positive impact on muscle,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://georg-speyer-haus.de/en/forschung/forschungsgruppen/prof-dr-florian-greten" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Florian Greten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Florian Greten&lt;/a&gt;, MD, researcher and director of the Georg-Speyer-Haus Institut für Tumorbiologie. (Separate early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests urolithin A has the potential to enhance muscle health and performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greten says it’s “exciting” that he and other researchers were able to detect these positive changes within a month. “We don’t know yet if you can take a lower amount and get a similar impact, but we are studying that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urolithin A is a bioactive compound that’s produced in the gut when certain compounds (mostly ellagitannins and ellagic acid) are broken down by specific gut bacteria, explains Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: Not everyone produces urolithin A efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that only about 40 percent of people have the right gut microbiome for this,” Dr. Greten says. If you don’t have the "right" microbiome, meaning you're missing certain necessary bacteria, your gut won’t produce this compound efficiently through foods, he says, adding that there’s no publicly available test to see if you have these bacteria or not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, urolithin A supplements can theoretically work despite missing certain bacteria since it doesn't need to be converted, Dr. Greten says. Remember: Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement, including urolithin A, especially if you have preexisting medical conditions or are taking any medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Dr. Greten's study, here’s some additional preliminary research swirling around urolithin A. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Early research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Early research&lt;/a&gt; indicates urolithin A may support healthy aging by enhancing how your cells produce and recycle energy,” says Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Some small human &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788244" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest it could improve muscle endurance and aspects of immune function, but the research is still preliminary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the research surrounding urolithin A involves supplements, but certain foods may spark a process in your body that &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; urolithin A. “It’s not found in large amounts in food, but your body creates it after you eat foods that are rich in these precursor compounds,” Cording says. (But Cording stresses that your individual microbiome plays a big role in whether or not your body can do this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those foods include &lt;strong&gt;pomegranate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;raspberries&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;blackberries&lt;/strong&gt;. “Eating these foods regularly may help, but the amount of urolithin A you generate varies from person to person,” she says, even if you do have the "right" bacteria to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have the right microbiome, eating and drinking these foods can lead to the production of urolithin A,” Dr. Greten says. But even then, you’d need to have a lot of these foods—Dr. Greten says you’d need to have 1.5 liters of pomegranate juice a day to mimic the effects of the supplement used in his study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately experts say that more research is needed around urolithin A. In the meantime, there are other things you can do to support longevity. “Don’t overlook lifestyle approaches to supporting healthy mitochondrial function, such as eating a well-balanced diet rich in &lt;a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyphenols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, exercising, prioritizing restful sleep, and managing stress,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 17:39:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNdnJWZG5zMnNNQkhhdWRBdncyNENjNUY2T2NNN3pNS0w2VF9JU0VxLUI4aV9YTTRGNDI4Ql9oV1gwSFBsd210X1JpX1dfUXY3QkpkMUhCS2lBOTZOU1VsaFFCdmFUWmxoNnNFT3ZfUEo1N0VvRm1zLXpYRlVXWHp1U0pvQzRrSTdW</guid></item><item><title>无耻的ROBOCALL ：罗克兰县发送未经授权的麻疹警报滥用Hatzoloh的名字- Monsey Scoop</title><link>https://monseyscoop.com/outrageous-robocall-rockland-county-sends-unauthorized-measles-alert-misusing-hatzolohs-name/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tdb-block-inner td-fix-index"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramapo residents woke up Wednesday morning to a shocking and unauthorized robocall blasted to thousands of homes in the Town of Ramapo, a call falsely presented as an “urgent notification from Hatzoloh of Rockland County,” warning of a community measles outbreak and urging residents to call Hatzoloh’s emergency hotline with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prerecorded message stated that “a measles outbreak has occurred in our community,” instructing residents to get vaccinated, avoid public places if symptomatic, and to call Hatzoloh at 845-425-1600 for guidance, overwhelming the volunteer EMS organization with a sudden influx of non-emergency calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh of Rockland County confirmed to Monsey Scoop that the robocall was completely unauthorized, not coordinated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While measles is indeed a concern in various parts of the region, Hatzoloh emphasized that medical guidance, including vaccination questions, should be directed to personal physicians, not emergency hotlines intended for life-saving situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh further noted that their hotline was “bombarded with unnecessary calls” following the county-issued robocall, potentially delaying response to genuine emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders and residents alike expressed outrage that Rockland County disseminated a medical advisory using Hatzoloh’s name without permission, creating confusion and placing undue burden on a volunteer emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health concerns must always be taken seriously, and residents are urged to &lt;strong&gt;consult their doctors regarding vaccination, symptoms, and medical guidance&lt;/strong&gt;. But the county’s decision to issue a robocall in Hatzoloh’s name, without authorization, has raised significant questions about procedure, communication, and respect for community partners.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago we looked at &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/11/6/2351534/-Diabetes-News-Miracle-Fruit-Synsepalum-Dulcificum" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Miracle Fruit (Synsepalum Dulcificum)&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have a different fruit, also from China, of similar appearance, showing similar benefits in research on diabetic mice—Nitraria roborowskii Kom. The active chemical is NRK-C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting I read recently…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Science Daily]: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251107010302.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Rare desert berry could transform diabetes treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Desert Berry Restores Metabolic Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed analysis revealed the extract's impressive range of benefits. Over the course of seven weeks, NRK-C reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 30-40% in diabetic mice, with stronger results at higher doses. It also improved insulin sensitivity by roughly 50% compared with untreated animals. In addition to these improvements, the extract balanced cholesterol and lowered oxidative stress markers by as much as 60%, a rare feat for any single therapeutic compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fruit of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, long used in traditional medicine, showed strong potential to fight insulin resistance and restore healthy metabolism in diabetic mice. The plant extract not only helped stabilize blood sugar but also corrected several related issues, including abnormal fat metabolism and oxidative stress. These results were linked to the activation of a key cellular signaling system that regulates how the body processes glucose and energy. The discovery points to the possibility of safer, naturally derived treatments for one of the world's most widespread chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIH: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37801345/" target="_blank"&gt;Chemical Profiling of Nitraria roborowskii Kom. by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS and Their Hypolipidemic Effects in Vivo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nitraria tangutorum improves pancreatic resistance in type 2 diabetic mice via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway” by Wu Di, Xu Jiyu, Wang Luya, Wu Li, Li Jiaxin, Banma Cailang, Zhao Xiaohui, Zhang Dejun and Yue Huilan, 14 April 2025, &lt;em&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.chinjmap.com/article/doi/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613" target="_blank"&gt;DOI: 10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chinjmap.com/article/doi/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613" target="_blank"&gt;Improvement Effect of Insulin Resistance of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria Roborowskii&lt;/em&gt; Kom in Type 2 Diabetic Mice via PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;To explore hypoglycemic effect of 95% ethanol fraction of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii &lt;/em&gt;Kom(NRK-C) and its possible mechanism evaluated in the type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METHODS&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The body weight, organ indices, blood glucose levels, serum biochemical indexes, as well as HE/PAS histopathological section were all analyzed to assess the hypoglycemic effect of NRK-C in T2DM mice induced by a high-fat diet(HFD) combined with six intraperitoneal injections of 35 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of streptozotocin(STZ). The Western blotting and immunofluorescence were further applied to determine the regulatory effect of NRK-C on key signaling proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESULTS&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The fasting blood glucose levels were significantly reduced after 7 weeks of administration of NRK-C. In addition, NRK-C could also significantly improve glucose tolerance, hepatic glycogen levels, and lipid levels(total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein), and significantly reduced insulin resistance of diabetic mice, which played an important role in the antidiabetic effects. Further mechanism research demonstrated that phosphorylated PI3K expression was up-regulated and p-GSK3β expression was up-regulated after NRK-C intervention, indicating that NRK-C might exert a potential antidiabetic effect by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;All these results suggested that NRK-C might improve T2DM and had the potential to be used as an adjunctive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="sp0015"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kom (NRK), with high economic and ecological value, is mainly distributed in the Qaidam Basin, China. However, research on its chemical components and bioactivities is still rare. In this study, its chemical constituents (52) including 10 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;-carboline alkaloids, nine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/cyclopeptide" target="_blank"&gt;cyclic peptides&lt;/a&gt;, three indole alkaloids, five pyrrole alkaloids, eight phenolic acids and 17 flavonoids were identified tentatively using UPLC-triple-TOF-MS/MS. Notablely, one new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;-carboline alkaloid and five new &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cyclic-peptide" target="_blank"&gt;cyclic peptides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; were confirmed using MS/MS fragmentation pathways. In addition, experiments in vitro indicated that NRK-C had strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/maltase" target="_blank"&gt;maltase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sucrase" target="_blank"&gt;sucrase&lt;/a&gt; inhibitory activities (IC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt; of 0.202 and 0.103 mg/mL, respectively). Polysaccharide tolerance experiments confirmed NRK-C (400 mg/kg) was associated with decreased postprandial blood glucose (PBG) in diabetic mice. These results suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nitraria" target="_blank"&gt;NRK&lt;/a&gt; fruit might be used as a functional ingredient in food products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases have risen in the United States in recent weeks, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 14% of tests for the illness came back positive during the week that ended on Nov. 15, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. Over 2,700 tests were conducted that week, according to the CDC, meaning that about 380 cases of norovirus were diagnosed in that period.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's more than double the percentage of positive tests recorded about three months ago, when test positivity in the U.S. this year was at its lowest. The week that ended on Aug. 9 saw a 6.53% positivity rate of more than 4,240 tests conducted during that period, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test positivity is an imperfect metric because it can vary based on the number of tests conducted. The CDC's data is based on reports from participating laboratories, hospitals and health departments. Test positivity rates can help provide general data about what diseases are circulating and when, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus, sometimes known as the stomach bug or stomach flu, is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the leading cause of foodborne illness, the agency says on its website. Norovirus is extremely contagious and causes symptoms including nausea, belly pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Most people experience symptoms for one to three days. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people are sickened with norovirus every year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;, and about 2,500 outbreaks of norovirus are reported in the U.S. each year. The illness results in over 100,000 hospitalizations and about 900 deaths per year. Adults 65 and older are the most likely to die from norovirus, the CDC said. Young children and those with compromised immune systems are also at a higher risk for severe illness or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of norovirus are most common between November and April, the CDC says. Last winter, the U.S. saw a major surge of norovirus, with a more than 25% test positivity rate &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-wave-twice-last-year-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recorded in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, earlier this month, a potential outbreak prompted a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/wilson-middle-school-closed-potential-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Michigan middle school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to close for a day for deep cleaning after dozens of students &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/norovirus-cases-on-the-rise-what-to-know-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reported feeling ill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Nearly 100 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/norovirus-outbreak-on-cruise-ship-sickens-nearly-100-people/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cruise ship passengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were sickened by norovirus in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing hands frequently, safely handling and preparing food, and regularly cleaning surfaces can help prevent norovirus from spreading, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is also contagious after symptoms end, so people should continue these precautions for at least two days after they begin to feel better, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

The benefits of lemon water go beyond just detoxing. “It amplifies the benefits of water, adding both mental and physical virtues,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2"}' href="https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kylie Bensley&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sulinu.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sulinu.com/"}' href="https://www.sulinu.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sulinu&lt;/a&gt;. “While drinking water can help us hit our hydration goals, infusing water with lemon is a very simple, quick task that boosts the function of water itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits of lemon water are many and worth diving into. Below, Bensley and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/"}' href="https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Parada&lt;/a&gt;, director of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://slowlifehouse.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://slowlifehouse.com/"}' href="https://slowlifehouse.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Slow Life House&lt;/a&gt;, break down everything we need to know about lemon water and how to drink it the right way (because yes, there is a wrong way to do it). Read on to see what they had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water supports our overall health and helps keep us hydrated. Adding this citrus fruit to it is a nice bonus for even more health benefits. A glass of lemon water has six main ones, according to Bensley and Parada. These benefits include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Supports the Gut Microbiome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps kick-start the digestion process in the morning,” says Parada, adding that it also helps fight indigestion, heartburn, and bloating. Additionally, lemon is known to stimulate bile and gastric-juice production, which can help prevent gas formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Lemon water] improves gut transit and hydrates the colon,” says Parada, which is why it can help with constipation, especially on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. In addition, lemon, rich in fiber, supports &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gut-digestive-health-best-expert-tips-nutritious-life-diet-sleep-stress-exercise-cleanse"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Strengthens the Immune System&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It strengthens the immune system,” says Parada, referring to the high vitamin C content of lemon juice. Additionally, it is also rich in vitamin B, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and enzymes. Studies show that lemon contains minerals that help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003767/" target="_blank"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, supporting our overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Provides Antiaging Skin Benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is good for the skin because of its &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/anti-aging-antioxidant-skin-care-night-vitamin-c-resveratrol"&gt;high content of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that “prevent damage from free radicals,” says Parada. Bensley agrees and says that lemon peels have been found to have antiaging benefits, reduce &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;oxidative stress in skin cells&lt;/a&gt;, and boost collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Hydrates the Body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You always need to make sure you’re drinking enough water. Lemon water hydrates the body and, especially first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, is an effective way to stimulate the metabolism. Another benefit of upgrading a glass of water with lemon juice? It can help you reach your water-intake goals. “[It] can give it a pleasant taste that makes [drinking plenty of water] easier,” says Parada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Reduces Anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lemon’s scent is more than just pleasant. Bensley points to a study where orthopedic surgery patients who used lemons as a form of aromatherapy experienced &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10290404/"&gt;lowered pre-procedure anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Though more studies need to be done to definitively prove its effect on anxiety and stress, wanting to take a whiff of lemon water before you drink it isn’t harmful if this has piqued your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Possibly Helps Maintain (or Lose) Weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary research suggests that lemon water is associated with weight loss. Bensley points to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581754/"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that showed lemon polyphenols can suppress diet-induced obesity. “So while it may not help lose weight through its chemical properties, it can suppress the risk of obesity,” she says. But more studies are needed on the relationship between lemon water and weight loss. As with anything health related, experts always advise seeking medical advice from your doctor or health care provider to develop a safe plan to incorporate lemon water into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;May Help With Kidney-Stone Prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is true for certain types of kidney stones. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola"}' href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Viola&lt;/a&gt;, DO, assistant professor of general internal medicine at Mount Sinai, explains that lemon water is high in citrate, a compound that binds to calcium in the urine and helps reduce the formation of crystals that can turn into stones. So drinking lemon water increases your urine volume and dilutes stone-forming substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Downsides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side effects of lemon water are few, but there are certain things to keep in mind. Among all the benefits this offers, alkalizing is not one of them, says Parada. “It is often heard that lemon water could modify the pH of the blood with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/acidity-diet-symptoms-foods-to-add-to-alkalise-body"&gt;an alkalizing effect&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “However, this is false since it’s the kidneys, liver, and lungs that are in charge of regulating blood acidity, keeping it in a range of 7.3 to 7.5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bensley advises against drinking water with lemon on an empty stomach, as it can be acidic and worsen already existing digestive problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux or frequent heartburn. She adds that the citric acid in lemons can worsen incontinence, as its acidity can irritate the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5rcE9TUmtzU1A4YzU1bHhqb01YdWV0TzRXa3FiN2dSYTNvR3cyeG9hUlotUC15UEdBQVI1aWpyOTNyTGc4dnRrWHd0UWowSzZfWWlYVENjSE9mR3M3ekk5ejFFSVVQZGc</guid></item><item><title>是感冒、流感还是新冠肺炎？关于症状和检测的注意事项-《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/is-it-cold-flu-or-covid-what-to-know-about-symptoms-and-testing/</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQNjNXNzNqbWdmdDJjZ3RZRG9QdHdDN21ib3JxUDlwRnpiTEZ5VVF5RVFERVo5ZTlkem1fUmx1S3BhNFVrbGhsTk81WE4tX1NHRTdzZUdKSG16U1R6bTJpR1ExN2tMRzBWV2NqTGpEQ1B3bl9NYWxQbnMxbHVJcEVFcjZYWkp0cmZrSV9oX3dTbzgzNGcwVVhXUFNjWjBpU3hGV3ltX0Z3VXdtUQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Is it cold, flu or COVID?

A study by Monash University in Australia now suggests that music can lighten the burden of this process, as the innate joy and comfort from it can also help retain functionality, which is a major win for those accustomed to soundtracking their lives; turns out songs have the power to preserve life and, to some extent, the hope for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in October 2025, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by honours student Emma Jaffa and Professor Joanne Ryan, who monitored more than 10,800 adults over the age of 70, drawing a stark parallel between listening to music regularly and a 39% reduction in the risk of dementia. More specifically, those who formed the habit of getting through each day in conjunction with their favourite tunes also produced “better global cognition and memory scores”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found significant benefits attached to playing an instrument, and although supplementing a love for music with the practice of playing did illustrate a 35% lower risk of dementia, there was no substantial evidence that it positively impacts cognitive test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, those who combined listening to music and playing it demonstrated the most promising results, as doing both was linked to a 33% reduced risk of dementia and a 22% decline in cognitive impairment that isn’t related to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that those who were actively learning as part of the education system for 16 years or more benefited from the above habits more than people who weren’t in school and college for that many years, while additionally showing that these patterns seem to have no bearing on how the subjects perceive themselves or their overall cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these findings aren’t definitive since they are essentially conclusions drawn from positioning a specific set of practices alongside a timeline of mental well-being; however, simultaneously, music does generate positive results regardless of its potential influence on dementia, so there’s a strong case to be made in favour of encouraging elderly people to listen to their favourite songs as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/soundtrack-superiority-should-we-be-doing-more-to-engage-with-the-music-we-listen-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;Music makes life worth living&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s no surprise that it might even help extend our time on this planet. We often tether our memories to the songs we love, and there’s something quite beautiful and poetic about the way the moments we cherish most can live on within the art we value deeply, and these moments keep the art alive even in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe title="Elliott Smith – Memory Lane (from From A Basement On The Hill)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-uDPv7iQEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="tags-title hf"&gt;Related Topics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/article&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Far Out Magazine</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSDYxWkhYTlg3T0pmLV9XTXA5Ujh3U3dRTHZGZnZqUm9vTFFDZjRzWG5rTjhCMHFpclR4ZThwQS1oMXYyWW8tYkxPcnZWWXA4V1lOLVAxNkN3TVJYZUV2MWZoQzdqSmZ0MHlCeGUycHQ4VllwRURTNUtaaER6akVYalRRYw</guid></item><item><title>5种不同寻常的健康习惯专家宣誓效忠，包括嗡嗡声-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/unusual-wellness-habits-from-experts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this age of booming social media, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wellness trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; are everywhere.

Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system’s T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body’s own healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured’. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don’t have any symptoms anymore,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn’t observe before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;several types of cancer&lt;/a&gt; since it was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;first approved&lt;/a&gt; to treat blood cancers in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new frontier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Last year, Du was also involved in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;world-first study&lt;/a&gt; of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body’s tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Childhood – from birth to age nine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adolescence – from nine to 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adulthood – from 32 to 66&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early ageing – from 66 to 83&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late ageing – from 83 onwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-does-the-brain-shift-from-one-phase-to-the-next"&gt;When does the brain shift from one phase to the next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the brain adapts to new surroundings and situations between birth and old age, researchers found that four ages – nine, 32, 66 and 83 – were the most pivotal in the brain’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifts are characterised by developments such as puberty, personality stabilisation, “reorganisation” and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In detail, these are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132402" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BRAIN-PHASES-NOV26-2025-1764155777.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - BRAIN PHASES - NOV26, 2025-1764155777" data-interactive="true" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Childhood – birth to nine years old&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, the grey and white matter of the brain rapidly grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information from United States-based Johns Hopkins Medicine, while grey matter primarily processes and interprets information, white matter transmits that information to other parts of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, grey matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath,” Johns Hopkins says. “In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: the white matter is on the outside, and the grey matter sits within.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the new study: “The first few years of life are marked by consolidation and competitive elimination of synapses [the junctions where neurons meet and communicate with each other] and rapid increases in grey and white matter volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This age also aligns with the onset of puberty, which begins between eight and 13 years old for females and nine and 14 years old for males, marking the initiation of significant alterations in hormone expression and robust neurological changes,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also found that the shift to adolescence introduced an “increased risk” of mental health, cognitive and behavioural disorders due to changes in hormones and a “neurobiological shift”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adolescence – 9 to 32&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was accepted that adolescence begins with puberty and ends before the age of 20. However, the study found that while adolescence certainly begins with puberty, its ending point is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The transition to adulthood is influenced by cultural, historical and social factors, making it context-dependent rather than a purely biological shift,” the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that in Western countries (ie, the United Kingdom and United States of America), adolescent topological development extends to around 32 years old, before brain networks begin a new trajectory of topological development,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that by age 32 in Western countries, the brain experiences the “most directional changes and a large shift in trajectory” compared with other turning points in life, as this is when white matter integrity and volume in the brain are increasing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not suggest a reason for this being the case in Western countries, and did not elaborate on how adolescence continues in people in other regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adulthood – 32 to 66&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that while brain development rapidly accelerates during the first two phases of life, in adulthood – the longest phase – there are no major turning points until the 60s, as the brain develops more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This period of network stability also corresponds with a plateau in intelligence and personality,” it found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early ageing – 66 to 83&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the brain does not show any abrupt signs of decline during this phase, shifts in the patterns of connection in the brain do occur due to a decrease in white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain now works more independently in separate regions, coordinating less as a single whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s mark an important shift in health and cognition, with the onset of dementia and elevated blood pressure for many, both of which can accelerate brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Late ageing – 83 onwards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is less data on this era of the brain’s progression than the other phases due to a low sample size, the study’s findings correlated with a declining trend in brain connectivity, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, this could reflect a true weakening relationship between age and structural brain topology in late life,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-significant"&gt;Why is this significant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research into the period of adolescence is the most significant finding from the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, adolescence ranges from 10 to 19 years of age. In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:33:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNR0lXWW94U29PM0pjcUllbVJLaTNjeTZYMlpFRXhKR0l2NVZPRzdGUVpNRUlESU0tRFMweXF6alpIVy1rSDZyODRCUndaYXJocmk0M2d2QmhyQkhYNjRmN0dHUlFqY3c3Z1VXalJ2a0ltWEtOMDJaOU1VT21oZ1JDbXBLTnV2Zkt6VG5Qbm9rSVRIekktUUZmaG5QS0g3cy1mc0VVa1R4ZUVFN0U</guid></item><item><title>青春期会持续到32岁吗？科学家解锁大脑的五个时代-半岛电视台</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/26/does-adolescence-last-until-32-scientists-unlock-brains-five-eras</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that adolescence can continue until the age of 32, as humans hit four major “turning points” in brain development at the ages of about nine, 32, 66 and 83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published on Tuesday in the journal, Nature Communications, the study examined nearly 4,000 scans of the brains of participants ranging in age up to 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers mapped out the brain’s development using this data and discovered that humans go through five “brain phases” – and within them, four significant life turning points as they grow, mature and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, they discovered, it is not until age 32 that human personality and intelligence “plateau” and stabilise following changes in early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-five-phases"&gt;What are the five phases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, brain development and ageing undergo five separate phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="spaced-bullet-spacing"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-does-the-brain-shift-from-one-phase-to-the-next"&gt;When does the brain shift from one phase to the next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the brain adapts to new surroundings and situations between birth and old age, researchers found that four ages – nine, 32, 66 and 83 – were the most pivotal in the brain’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifts are characterised by developments such as puberty, personality stabilisation, “reorganisation” and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In detail, these are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132402" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BRAIN-PHASES-NOV26-2025-1764155777.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - BRAIN PHASES - NOV26, 2025-1764155777" data-interactive="true" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Childhood – birth to nine years old&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, the grey and white matter of the brain rapidly grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information from United States-based Johns Hopkins Medicine, while grey matter primarily processes and interprets information, white matter transmits that information to other parts of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, grey matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath,” Johns Hopkins says. “In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: the white matter is on the outside, and the grey matter sits within.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the new study: “The first few years of life are marked by consolidation and competitive elimination of synapses [the junctions where neurons meet and communicate with each other] and rapid increases in grey and white matter volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This age also aligns with the onset of puberty, which begins between eight and 13 years old for females and nine and 14 years old for males, marking the initiation of significant alterations in hormone expression and robust neurological changes,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also found that the shift to adolescence introduced an “increased risk” of mental health, cognitive and behavioural disorders due to changes in hormones and a “neurobiological shift”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adolescence – 9 to 32&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was accepted that adolescence begins with puberty and ends before the age of 20. However, the study found that while adolescence certainly begins with puberty, its ending point is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The transition to adulthood is influenced by cultural, historical and social factors, making it context-dependent rather than a purely biological shift,” the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that in Western countries (ie, the United Kingdom and United States of America), adolescent topological development extends to around 32 years old, before brain networks begin a new trajectory of topological development,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that by age 32 in Western countries, the brain experiences the “most directional changes and a large shift in trajectory” compared with other turning points in life, as this is when white matter integrity and volume in the brain are increasing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not suggest a reason for this being the case in Western countries, and did not elaborate on how adolescence continues in people in other regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adulthood – 32 to 66&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that while brain development rapidly accelerates during the first two phases of life, in adulthood – the longest phase – there are no major turning points until the 60s, as the brain develops more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This period of network stability also corresponds with a plateau in intelligence and personality,” it found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early ageing – 66 to 83&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the brain does not show any abrupt signs of decline during this phase, shifts in the patterns of connection in the brain do occur due to a decrease in white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain now works more independently in separate regions, coordinating less as a single whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s mark an important shift in health and cognition, with the onset of dementia and elevated blood pressure for many, both of which can accelerate brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Late ageing – 83 onwards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is less data on this era of the brain’s progression than the other phases due to a low sample size, the study’s findings correlated with a declining trend in brain connectivity, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, this could reflect a true weakening relationship between age and structural brain topology in late life,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-significant"&gt;Why is this significant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research into the period of adolescence is the most significant finding from the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, adolescence ranges from 10 to 19 years of age. In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:33:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNR0lXWW94U29PM0pjcUllbVJLaTNjeTZYMlpFRXhKR0l2NVZPRzdGUVpNRUlESU0tRFMweXF6alpIVy1rSDZyODRCUndaYXJocmk0M2d2QmhyQkhYNjRmN0dHUlFqY3c3Z1VXalJ2a0ltWEtOMDJaOU1VT21oZ1JDbXBLTnV2Zkt6VG5Qbm9rSVRIekktUUZmaG5QS0g3cy1mc0VVa1R4ZUVFN0XSAbABQVVfeXFMTU5GaFZmODZBSDR0TDNWNWV5S1FzdzVOQ3hDeWEwT3ZqMU5JeUp1M3dKc0llRHlCX2MzUXp3dVBzVjJ5YUZHcEVQSC1pT1ZVSXAzeVdkMXEzSGhGeVc0X1JJYXVFUUw4bnoycW9FNHdXS1RjLVR1RVpnREFvdzJMM2FIdElUM2xPT1Zrd0ZzMTNZeHU5MzlZOFBUVmdrRG9nLVZ5NlVqZEZrcno2c0w5ZFE</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：一个男人的肌肉看起来奇怪地变形。医生发现他们正在将钙泄漏到他的血液中。- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-mans-muscles-looked-strangely-deformed-doctors-found-they-were-leaking-calcium-into-his-blood</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

Additionally, over the year prior, he had developed weakness and lost 40 pounds (18 kilograms) without trying to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="6f3395aa-26bf-4439-8ad9-2f123f61e9d6-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; Blood tests revealed that the man had elevated creatine and urea levels, indicating his kidneys were failing. His blood calcium levels were also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypercalcemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355523" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypercalcemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355523" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dangerously high&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. CT scans then showed calcium deposits in his kidneys, pancreas and stomach, as well as scar-like areas in the back and lower parts of his lungs. These scans also showed unusual changes in his chest muscles; they appeared densely calcified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5a4e5b66-ef2d-4da7-ae12-e80764f62f5f"&gt;Doctors treated the patient with a diuretic to help remove excess calcium, as well as intravenous fluids, a steroid, and a calcium-lowering drug. His calcium levels briefly dropped, and he was discharged with a couple prescriptions. However, three weeks later during a follow-up, doctors found his blood-calcium levels had risen again, and he was admitted to a nephrology ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was generally stable, but a physical exam showed noticeable changes in his upper-arm and chest muscles, matching the irregularities seen on the scans. The doctors then revisited the patient's medical history, and he shared a crucial detail: starting about 30 years earlier, he had started receiving "unknown intramuscular injections (probably containing testosterone)" into his chest and upper-arm muscles to enlarge them, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1357071345580968393&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12882-025-04397-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-mans-muscles-looked-strangely-deformed-doctors-found-they-were-leaking-calcium-into-his-blood" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12882-025-04397-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12882-025-04397-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-mans-muscles-looked-strangely-deformed-doctors-found-they-were-leaking-calcium-into-his-blood" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of his case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He stressed that the last dose of these injections was received 2 years ago," the report authors noted. The exact frequency at which he'd historically gotten the injections is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests showed that the man's calcium-controlling &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58980-parathyroid-glands.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58980-parathyroid-glands.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;parathyroid hormone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was markedly low, ruling out a common hormonal cause of high calcium. The man also had no signs of hidden cancers in his digestive tract, no abnormalities on a urology evaluation, and no signs of an autoimmune condition. With other causes excluded, the medical team biopsied one of the abnormal muscle regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6yXby3vwcvYQpF9q9HWoi3" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6yXby3vwcvYQpF9q9HWoi3 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="490cab3a-3cfd-4787-83cf-cd0ece20b0b6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Under the microscope, the muscle was filled with a silicone-like, oil-based substance and surrounded by dense calcium deposits. The team deduced that the man's past muscular injections probably contained &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-synthol-and-why-are-bodybuilders-injecting-it-into-their-muscles-237528" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-synthol-and-why-are-bodybuilders-injecting-it-into-their-muscles-237528" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;synthol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a substance made primarily of oil that visually "plumps" up muscles, essentially inflating them like water balloons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the synthol had triggered a persistent foreign-body reaction — the body essentially responding to material it could not break down. Over time, this reaction produced scarring and calcification, storing large amounts of calcium inside the muscle. And eventually, that calcium made its way into his bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;A couple &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2021/09000/synthol_systemic_complications__hypercalcemia_and.92.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2021/09000/synthol_systemic_complications__hypercalcemia_and.92.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of similar cases suggested that surgically removing the calcified muscle would be the only reliable long-term treatment for the man's persistently high calcium. In one previous patient, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl_3/iii434/3853797" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl_3/iii434/3853797" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;calcium levels returned to normal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three months after the tissue was removed. However, in the man's case, the authors did not state whether the patient ultimately underwent surgery, nor did they describe his long-term outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Synthol injections typically contain 85% medium-chain triglycerides, 7.5% of a local anesthetic like lidocaine, and 7.5% alcohol, purportedly for sterility. The oils act as the muscle-bulking agent, as the body does not easily process them, and the effects of these injections can linger for years. Even though it comes with serious risks, such as muscle deformity, chronic wounds and scarring, synthol is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/synthol-injections" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.healthline.com/health/synthol-injections" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;relatively easy to buy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b248fb1f-d151-44c0-98ca-382ecbb58551"&gt;Only two other cases of high blood calcium linked to synthol injections had been reported, the case report authors noted, and both were from Lebanon. The underlying mechanism driving the effect remains unclear. Synthol's better-known complications usually appear soon after an injection, but in this patient, the effects apparently emerged years later, which made the cause unusually difficult to identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this case adds further evidence that "synthol intramuscular injections are among the causes of elevated serum calcium levels," despite its rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="3a39cab6-ece3-4403-a54c-d26c5ffdab48"&gt;

Yet, &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. rectale&lt;/i&gt; were protected against BPAF in the community (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig2"&gt;2g&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-level effects, such as cross-protection, have been described in gut bacterial communities exposed to therapeutic drugs and could partly be attributed to compound bioaccumulation&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Klünemann, M. et al.

Although a model trained and tested on the combined pesticide–drug dataset showed similar performance, cross-predictions from one dataset to another showed poorer performance (approximate balanced accuracy = 0.7; average precision = 0.2). This indicates that pesticides and drugs are overall different in both chemical and activity space (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig3"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;).

Therefore, resistance to closantel and TBBPA can lead to cross-resistance to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differential enrichment of &lt;i&gt;acrR&lt;/i&gt; Tn mutants suggests a degree of specificity in the efflux of chemicals and/or that efflux alone is insufficient in tackling the other chemicals. However, some transporter Tn mutants showed broad pollutant sensitivity, indicating common pollutant tolerance mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;P. merdae&lt;/i&gt;.

Besides TBBPA, &lt;i&gt;NQ542_03725&lt;/i&gt; mutants also show enrichment under 500 μM PFNA, 20 μM BPAF and 20 μM fluazinam, and the &lt;i&gt;porA&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster is also selected under 500 μM PFNA and 20 μM BPAF (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;). If these xenobiotics select for the loss of bacterial biosynthesis of BCAA-derived beneficial metabolites such as branched short-chain fatty acids and α-galactosylceramides in vivo, they could further impact human health via gut–heart or gut–immune axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss-of-function Tn insertion mutants of the secondary metabolism genes &lt;i&gt;NQ542_07535–55&lt;/i&gt; were positively selected under 500 μM PFNA challenge (~16-fold enrichment), but were negative fitness hits under 20 μM TBBPA (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;).

To validate the phenotype, we isolated two &lt;i&gt;P. merdae&lt;/i&gt; mutants (with transposon insertions at two locations of the gene &lt;i&gt;NQ542_07540&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes putative phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase) after enrichment in 500 μM PFNA. These strains showed increased resistance to PFNA and hypersensitivity to TBBPA at a range of concentrations, in agreement with pooled fitness (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig4"&gt;4h&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig9"&gt;5d,e&lt;/a&gt;). To evaluate whether the increased resistance to PFNA was due to differences in compound uptake, we tested PFNA bioaccumulation, but no growth-independent differences were seen (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig9"&gt;5f&lt;/a&gt;), indicating the accumulation-independent function of inositol lipid metabolism in PFNA resistance. In summary, our genetic screen suggests that loss-of-function mutations affecting accessory metabolic pathways might be selected for under xenobiotic exposure, potentially altering the metabolic output of the gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 10:45:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1vNXFiSzhmZ3ZCaVdpdjdEYjNBNFg1VzBjcFI5RzlyM0JDdng2bk0tYXF6T0ZKdFpBTmpEaUZ2Q2tQNVdqbTZmV0xBVVoybTY3TGJTU2tHekhTTUtlRTlJ</guid></item><item><title>警报！无声的塑料化学品可能会使您的心脏处于严重危险之中，并伤害数百万人； scienti -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/alert-silent-plastic-chemicals-could-be-putting-your-heart-at-serious-risk-and-harming-millions-scientists-warn/articleshow/125581834.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major global study has issued a strong warning about the hidden dangers that everyday plastics may pose to heart health. Researchers found that phthalates, toxic chemicals commonly used to make plastics flexible, could be quietly harming the heart over time. These chemicals are present in items that many people use daily, from food containers to toys and personal care products. As plastic consumption continues to rise rapidly across India, experts say the findings highlight an urgent need for greater awareness. Simple steps such as reducing plastic use, choosing safer alternatives, and avoiding storing hot food in plastic containers may help lower exposure. The study suggests that small lifestyle changes could protect millions from long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden dangers of household plastics: How phthalates are fueling heart disease in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease in India is often linked to poor diet, stress, pollution, or sedentary lifestyles. However, scientists now argue that the danger may also lie in ordinary plastic products found in almost every home. Bottles, food containers, toys, cosmetics, shampoo bottles, and even kitchen supplies may release phthalates that accumulate in the body over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40307157/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, these chemicals are linked to more than one lakh heart-related deaths in India in a single year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This figure highlights an invisible threat that most people have never heard of, despite using items containing phthalates daily. Phthalates are chemical additives that make plastics flexible, soft, and durable. Their usefulness is also the reason for their risk. They do not stay locked inside the plastic material. Instead, they slowly migrate into the environment. They leach into food when plastic containers are heated, seep into stored water when kept in plastic bottles for long periods, and are released into the air inside our homes. They also enter the body through cosmetics, perfumes, and personal care items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once phthalates enter the bloodstream, their effect becomes more concerning. They behave as hormone disruptors and interfere with the endocrine system, which is responsible for regulating many essential body functions. Researchers note that they can weaken metabolic health, influence reproductive function, impair respiratory processes, and most importantly, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A global analysis revealed that more than 3.5 lakh people worldwide died in 2018 due to phthalate exposure, with India alone accounting for over one lakh of these deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How everyday plastics can raise heart risks worldwide&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer examination of the global data shows how significant the risk truly is. Scientists studied information from 66 countries and found that exposure to di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, commonly known as DEHP, contributed to an estimated 13 per cent of cardiovascular deaths among individuals aged 55 to 64 in 2018. Regions with high population density, rapid industrial growth and heavy plastic usage, including South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia, carried the greatest share of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study noted that even low but continuous exposure was enough to increase heart disease risk, because the chemicals slowly accumulate in fat tissues and remain in the body for long periods. This global trend closely matches India’s situation, showing how widespread and persistent the threat is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why phthalates damage the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that the most harmful phthalate, DEHP, affects the heart primarily by causing inflammation. When these chemicals circulate in the bloodstream, they can irritate the inner lining of arteries. Over time, this leads to arterial stiffness, plaque buildup and narrowing of the vessels. Such conditions increase the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes, especially when exposure continues over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts, when absorbed daily, can create long-term damage because the inflammatory process becomes continuous. This makes the danger far more serious than many other environmental toxins, which leave the body more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How phthalates pose a bigger heart risk in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India faces a greater risk from phthalate-related heart disease for several structural and lifestyle reasons. The country depends heavily on plastic in packaging, food storage, medical supplies, and everyday household use. Regulations surrounding the use of harmful chemical additives remain limited, which allows unsafe plastics to circulate widely. Public knowledge about phthalate risks is also low, particularly in rural and low-income communities where plastic products are used without caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children, pregnant women, and elderly individuals are at the highest risk. Their bodies either absorb more chemicals or are more sensitive to hormonal disruption, which makes the long-term health impact even more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to reduce exposure at home&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While completely eliminating phthalates from the environment is impossible, reducing exposure is both achievable and effective. Avoid heating or microwaving food in plastic containers, as this accelerates chemical leakage. Use stainless steel or glass bottles and containers for storage. Choose cosmetics and personal care products that clearly state that they are phthalate free. These simple adjustments can gradually reduce the amount of toxic chemicals entering the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing health threat posed by phthalates demands a combination of personal responsibility and government intervention. Safe alternatives to harmful plastics already exist, but widespread adoption will require clear regulations and stronger enforcement. Until such policy changes occur, public awareness remains the most powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/worlds-first-lung-cancer-prevention-vaccine-trial-funded-with-2-06-million-to-stop-cancer-before-it-starts/articleshow/125560666.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World’s first lung cancer prevention vaccine trial funded with £2.06 million to stop cancer before it starts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgJBVV95cUxObjl5ekp6Si11VTloLThMVTI1XzY3OVZWUFpnSUoyZmYyd2htYk9jNElvVmFHbXJMejdRZVNSYXFQcXFWY05xTF9JVE1TdjBCak9qV0x6cm5WUElKU3JYM2sxV1E5aWZ1VWhlTUZ2UFZHX2VMSGpidW9oTk5rQU4wNDNoMzZHM3BnaGhxcTJ5SU8wTUFrWEM5R1Z0ci1zSWRGbl9Yb2Q4bU92UlVkc2ZVVTZCbUNhQWJrZ0pYUEo2Vk1Bc2JyZm1lTmFpMWV6RlB1Y0VjcnRjT3EzUFZ3ekw5Z2xmSmFiMFBwZDZsdWdNRXFkeG5xQ04wU3NrcnhhQkdFbVJVUEp4eHZjM0ZkSG0yWVZGazJ5c2p0UUxBSW8wbGZDWG9BZGdSYjlZTk54Zlczd3h2bGZB</guid></item><item><title>Golden Retriever的“Morning Shenanigans”包括抓住好友的尾巴-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-morning-shenanigans-holding-101740951.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With two dogs at home, life can be sometimes chaotic but entertaining.

Named Cali, the fur baby does not leave her friend’s tail while roaming in her house. This clip has attracted many viewers, who have found the pooch’s antics hilarious. While one user quipped, “Emotional support tail,” another wrote, “Dog leading a dog.” Most comments featured laughing emoticons, while one individual referred to them as “mama elephants and her baby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever follows German Shepherd while holding onto the tail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a recent &lt;span&gt;Instagram video&lt;/span&gt;, a Golden Retriever named Cali has found the best buddy to have fun at home. The clip shows how the fluffy dog holds onto her German Shepherd friend’s tail while running around the house. According to the caption, owners witness this often in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It begins with the German Shepherd climbing down the stairs in a rush. Within seconds, viewers can see Cali the Golden Retriever clutching onto her buddy’s tail in her mouth and following him at the same speed. After the stairs, they cross the kitchen and are later seen in the living room. There, Cali is still holding onto the tail, while the Shepherd supposedly tries to release it from her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, viewers have found the video of the Golden Retriever and German Shepherd amusing. At the time of writing, the Instagram Reel has received over 7K likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the Golden Retriever German Shepherd video hinted that the two belong to the same house, another post proved otherwise. The owner posted a clip in which Cali and her buddy are lying on the floor with almost no space in between them. Before looking at the camera, Cali keeps her face on her friend’s back, seeking comfort.

In the United States, for example, government researchers last year reported that more than 11% of children had received an ADHD diagnosis at some point in their lives&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — a sharp increase from 2003, when around 8% of children had (see ‘ADHD among US boys and girls’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03143-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51483336.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why is autism really on the rise? What the science says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, top US health officials argue that diagnoses have spiralled out of control. In May, the Make America Healthy Again Commission — led by US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — said ADHD was part of a “crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment” and suggested that ADHD medications did not help children in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what, exactly, is going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s clear is that several factors — including improved detection and greater awareness of ADHD — are causing people with symptoms to receive a diagnosis and treatment, whereas they wouldn’t have years earlier. Clinicians say this is especially true for women and girls, whose pattern of symptoms was often missed in the past. Although some specialists are concerned about the risks of overdiagnosis, many are more worried that too many people go undiagnosed and untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the rise in awareness and diagnoses of ADHD has fuelled a public debate about how it should be viewed and how best to provide support, including when medication is required. The emergence of the neurodiversity movement is challenging the view of ADHD as a disorder that should be ‘treated’, and instead proposes that it’s a difference that should be better understood and supported — with more focus on adapting schools and workplaces, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741560.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741560.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ADHD among US boys and girls.

It’s not the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many clinicians and people with ADHD argue that it is associated with difficulties — ranging from academic struggles to an increased chance of injuries and substance misuse — that justify its label as a medical condition, and say that medication is an important and effective part of therapy for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hear a lot of people talking about ADHD being a gift and a superpower, and I do applaud that,” says Jeremy Didier, a clinician specializing in ADHD who is president of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit–Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a non-profit US group based in Lanham, Maryland, and who has ADHD herself. “But I do not want to downplay the impact that ADHD can have on someone’s life when it’s either undiagnosed or poorly managed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and others say both models — neurodiversity and medical — have merit. “Bringing those two together in a meaningful and productive way, I think that’s maybe the biggest challenge” for the field, says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A real rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slew of studies suggests that diagnoses of ADHD have gone up in many high-income countries in the past two to three decades — similar to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rise in autism diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; (see ‘ADHD on the rise’). The rate of new ADHD diagnoses in the United Kingdom, for example, doubled in boys and quadrupled in girls between 2000 and 2018, according to one study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In adults, the rate shot up even more. “We have numbers suggesting that we’re seeing a rise,” says Max Wiznitzer, a paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741554.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741554.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ADHD on the rise.

It doesn’t seem to be a big rise in the prevalence of the symptoms and traits that characterize ADHD — namely hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, researchers say. When scientists use standard procedures to rigorously assess symptoms in representative samples of a population, they find that the ‘true’ prevalence of ADHD is fairly consistent in different parts of the world — estimated at around 5.4% in children&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and 2.6% in adults&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, according to two comprehensive global studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say there are several reasons these figures are much lower than the 11% diagnosis level in US children that the country’s health authorities reported last year&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That number comes from the US National Survey of Children’s Health conducted in 2022, in which parents were asked whether a doctor or other health-care provider had ever said their child has ADHD. But this method of assessing prevalence would lead to inflated counts, says Luis Rohde, a psychiatrist and ADHD specialist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Some children were probably misdiagnosed — perhaps by a physician without specialist training — and would not be classified as having ADHD in a thorough clinical evaluation. Some parents might have misremembered, perhaps if they were told that their child had symptoms without a formal diagnosis, he says. And some children who once had a diagnosis would no longer have received one at the time of the survey if their symptoms had waned and they were reassessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and specialists highlight other factors that are likely to be driving up the number of diagnoses. One is a change in diagnostic criteria in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;DSM&lt;/i&gt;). In the fourth edition of this widely used manual, introduced in 1994, a child or adult ADHD diagnosis required the presence of at least six of a list of nine inattention symptoms and/or six or more of nine hyperactivity symptoms, and stipulated that these had to be present before the age of seven. (This reflects the idea that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises during childhood brain development.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the fifth edition, &lt;i&gt;DSM-V,&lt;/i&gt; arrived in 2013, the criteria were slightly relaxed. Symptoms had to be present before age 12, and adult diagnosis required a minimum of five symptoms. (Children still had to have at least six.) “So when we expand the criteria, obviously you increase a little bit the prevalence,” says Rohde, who was involved in those revisions. It has also become more common for clinicians to diagnose ADHD along with other conditions, when in the past they tended to focus on one, says Bölte: “That fuels the figures.” ADHD commonly occurs with autism, as well as with anxiety, depression and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The impairment requirement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a thorough ADHD assessment involves collecting a detailed history and completing behaviour questionnaires, including input from family members and, for children, from schools. In the United States, the condition can be diagnosed by a range of health professionals, including psychiatrists, other mental-health specialists and primary-care physicians such as paediatricians, who might not have dedicated training in ADHD. But countries differ: in Brazil and many other low- and middle-income nations, people with ADHD symptoms tend to be sent to neurologists and psychiatrists for ADHD assessment and diagnoses, and there is a shortage of such specialists, Rohde says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;DSM-V&lt;/i&gt; defines three ‘presentations’ of ADHD. People with ‘predominantly inattentive’ ADHD show symptoms such as making careless mistakes, struggling to sustain attention, losing things and being easily distracted. Those with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD have traits such as fidgeting, restlessness, talking excessively and interrupting others. In a third, combined presentation, people show both sets of symptoms. A diagnosis requires that symptoms are present for at least six months and in two or more settings (such as school, home, work); are not explained by another condition such as anxiety; and cause an impairment, such as struggling with schoolwork, losing a job or having relationship problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51736478.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51736478.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Conceptual illustration showing an abstract human profile with a jumbled pink string inside." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51736478.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Illustration by Ada Zielińska&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impairment requirement is key, clinicians say. These traits vary across the population: some individuals are very hyperactive or inattentive, and some not at all. But people tend to be diagnosed with ADHD when their symptoms significantly interfere with their lives. “The medical part of ADHD comes in when your life is becoming derailed,” says Margaret Sibley, a specialist in psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bölte says that clinicians are interpreting the diagnostic criteria “far more liberally and openly” than in the past. This is another factor — aside from changes in the diagnostic criteria — that is driving the apparent surge in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But working out when someone crosses the impairment line involves a subjective and sometimes tricky judgement, say specialists. And there is an ongoing debate about whether a person’s level of impairment should be defined relative to their own potential or to a population average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that more parents as well as children are deemed as crossing that threshold. Wiznitzer says that when he diagnoses a child, “almost invariably [one of] the parents has it”, too. (That’s because genes are a major contributor to ADHD: the disorder has a heritability&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of roughly 70–80%.) Even though the parents were probably symptomatic as children, many were not identified as having the condition, he says. But now, they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;ADHD on TikTok&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason why diagnoses have surged is an increase in public awareness of ADHD — fuelled by an explosion of discussion on TikTok and other social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information online “connects with some people who have had these symptoms and impairments for a long time, but never understood what they were,” says Sibley. That leads them to seek information and professional help, pushing diagnoses up. And people might be eager to receive a diagnosis if it allows them to access help and services for themselves or a child, such as adaptations to support learning at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in ADHD has led to concerns, particularly in the United States, about questionable diagnoses being given without a thorough clinical evaluation — through online services, for example, or by medical professionals without ADHD training. “They’ve got a visit for 15 or 20 minutes, and the diagnosis is made,” says Stephen Hinshaw, a specialist in child and adolescent mental health and ADHD at the University of California, Berkeley. But Didier says that a bigger problem is the number of people with ADHD who are undiagnosed or untreated. She emphasizes how important it is for people to have access to a thorough, accurate assessment from a trained professional who specializes in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of recognition of ADHD is a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries, says Rohde. “The problem here is clearly underdiagnosis, stigma and undertreatment,” he says, which particularly affects “vulnerable people and communities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51426444.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Autism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many specialists say they’re observing a rapid rise of diagnoses in girls and women&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In part, that’s thought to be because women and girls are more likely to have symptoms of inattention — rather than more-noticeable hyperactivity — and to find organizational and other strategies that ‘mask’ those symptoms. Didier says that, despite being an ADHD specialist and diagnosing the condition in three of her sons, she and other ADHD practitioners missed the signs and symptoms in her daughter until she was a teenager. “It’s egregious that we don’t have more research on ADHD trajectories in women,” Sibley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the world itself are yet another possible contributor to increased diagnoses. Some researchers speculate that schools, work, technology and other aspects of modern lives have become so complex and taxing that they are pushing more people beyond the threshold of impairment. In Sweden, says Bölte, schools are sometimes chaotic, with complex schedules and grading systems. “Many students are very confused and fed up with school and do not understand it any more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published last year&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; revealed that parents think their children are struggling more. The research team examined how parents viewed the ADHD symptoms of more than 27,000 nine-year-old children born in Sweden. Parents consulted in 2016–18 tended to say that their children were more impaired than did parents consulted in 2004–06, even though their kids had the same number of symptoms. “Environment around the child is crucial,” says Samuele Cortese, who studies ADHD at the University of Southampton, UK, and was involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Context is key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karp describes ADHD as “context-dependent”. In a school where children are expected to sit still and be quiet, “it makes these traits seem like a problem”, he says. But when someone with ADHD is in an environment that nurtures and empowers them, they “can then channel their neurotype to do incredible things”. Karp is not against medication — and sometimes takes it himself — but would like more emphasis on institutions and society evolving so that people with ADHD can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, meanwhile, are finding evidence that the severity of symptoms can vary over time. In a 2021 study, Sibley and her colleagues analysed detailed records of more than 550 children who were diagnosed with ADHD and followed for up to 16 years&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The researchers found that 64% of young people had fluctuations in ADHD — times when their symptoms faded but then recurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibley and her team hypothesized that people’s symptoms might flare up when they were facing increased demands in their lives, such as when starting a new school or having a child. But in fact, the opposite seemed to be true, according to a later analysis by Sibley and her colleagues&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This could be because people are able to take on more responsibility when their symptoms abate. But the alternative explanation — one that has “really resonated”, Sibley says — is that people with ADHD need a degree of activity and accountability in their lives to perform and stay engaged. Sibley thinks there might be a U-shaped curve: too many or too few demands and obligations mean that people with ADHD don’t function at their best — but at a “sweet spot”, they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One study took vaginal swabs from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-471" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;20 smokers and non-smokers&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the smokers tested had &lt;i id="lactobacillus" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;-depleted microbiomes in comparison to just 15% of non-smokers.

&lt;p&gt;BOILING SPRINGS, S.C. — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;more than 1,700 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/#:~:text=Measles%20has%20been%20officially%20%E2%80%9Celiminated,in%20any%20year%20since%201992."&gt;elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schools and ‘Small Brush Fires’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to &lt;a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/features/your_health/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccine-requirements-worry-public-health-experts-in-south-carolina/article_86dc5de0-926f-11e7-93ba-47e9fd2cff5f.html"&gt;data published by The Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Health Freedom’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-autism-baseless-new-guidance-website/"&gt;have been ignored by health authorities&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, he has made other &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;misleading or unsupported statements&lt;/a&gt;. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s covid vaccine outreach efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a covid vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/families/schoolhealth/dashboard.php"&gt;MMR vaccine rates have declined&lt;/a&gt; among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2022-02-01/missouri-senate-rejects-governors-pick-for-health-director-over-support-for-covid-vaccines"&gt;rejected a public health director&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a raft of changes to how products containing vitamin B6 are packaged and sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA decision is based on an extensive review, prompted by &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-26/tga-confirms-removal-of-toxic-vitamin-b6-from-shelves/106052270"&gt;widespread concerns&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that high doses were causing toxicity and leading to lasting nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the tighter controls – which include restrictions on over-the-counter sales for higher doses – will strike a balance between the vitamin’s benefits and its potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may leave some people confused about whether vitamin B6 is safe to take. How much is too much? And can I still buy my supplement over-the-counter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin B6 do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B6 (also known as pyridoxine, pyridoxamine and pyridoxal) is an essential vitamin for good health, involved in more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.06.023"&gt;140 processes&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can’t produce it ourselves, so we need to get it elsewhere – mainly from our diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B6 can be found in a wide range of foods, including animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant-based sources include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legumes (such as chickpeas, lentils and beans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vegetables (including potatoes, spinach, carrots and kale)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fruits (such as avocado, bananas and oranges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grains (including corn, brown rice, oats and fortified cereals). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended dietary daily intake of B6 varies based on age. So wherever you get it – diet or supplements – this is the recommended amount per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-b6"&gt;upper recommended limit&lt;/a&gt; for healthy adults is 50mg/day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the recommended intake is lower for infants and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For detailed information, visit the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-b6"&gt;Eat for Health website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too much vs too little&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to diseases including some kinds of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djw230"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1569826"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; disorders, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2023.1237103"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (such as heart attacks or strokes). However, this kind of deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;is not common&lt;/a&gt; in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, some people choose to take vitamin B6 as a supplement. Or they may take other products and be unaware they contain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can increase the risk of having too much – which can be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/vitamin-b6-is-essential-but-too-much-can-be-toxic-heres-what-to-know-to-stay-safe-248443"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking high doses of vitamin B6 over a long time can lead to poisoning and &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/vitamin-b6-toxicity"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; peripheral neuropathy. This condition damages the nervous system and causes pain, weakness, numbness and tingling, mainly in the limbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toxicity from food sources is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554500/"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt;, including among individuals with enzyme deficiencies that slow B6 metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all documented vitamin B6 toxicity results from excessive supplement intake, as levels found in natural foods remain well below harmful thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:746sksvmlwppi6zda5c7rtzb/app.bsky.feed.post/3lgubaqofoj2l"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is changing? How much can I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA’s decision to tighten rules about vitamin B6 products responds to a worrying number of peripheral neuropathy cases in Australia, linked to various vitamin supplements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tighter measures will come into effect on June 1 2027. The changes &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  pharmacist supervision for purchase of products containing more than 50mg but less than 200mg of B6 per recommended daily dose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  prescriptions required for products with more than 200mg of B6 per recommended daily dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the products now requiring prescriptions or pharmacist supervision have around 19–117 times the recommended intake. Products with 50mg per recommended daily dose or less will still be available over-the-counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of B6 which might cause toxicity is not fully known, as it seems to vary across the population. Some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557436/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have identified nerve damage in people taking less than 500mg/day, but not below 200mg/day. So this is likely why the TGA chose these limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Combining products increases your risk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new regulations are likely to affect specific standalone B6 products, which tend to have the highest doses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But B6 is commonly also added to &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety-monitoring-and-information/safety-alerts/health-supplements-containing-vitamin-b6-can-cause-peripheral-neuropathy"&gt;multivitamins&lt;/a&gt;, “ageing support” supplements, skin and hair support products, and effervescent products &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1101296/vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation.pdf"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; Berocca. Most of these contain less than 50mg in the daily recommended dose, and so will continue to be available over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are unaware how much vitamin B6 they are consuming, often across multiple supplements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely the combination of these products that leads to people unknowingly consuming significant enough doses to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes to labelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA’s report &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-11/notice-final-decision-to-amend-current-poisons-standard-pyridoxine-pyridoxa-pyridoxamine-vitamin-b6.pdf"&gt;also acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; the need for clearer labelling, including mandatory front-of-pack statements that indicate when a product contains vitamin B6 – especially in combination products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the 125 medicines containing more than 50mg and less than 200mg per recommended daily dose of vitamin B6 are currently listed as complementary medicines. They will need to be registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and relabelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the report says the TGA may decide to introduce further packaging changes, including strengthening warning statements and change how vitamin B6 is labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take vitamin supplements of any kind, check the label to ensure you are not exceeding the recommendations (50mg/day is more than adequate) across all your supplements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, ask your pharmacist for advice. If you’re worried you’ve taken too much vitamin B6, see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        

        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Conversation</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 08:50:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPNmduZlg4R2I1RGVFRV9VOVZrdHVuR0xmMXBmMUxkWlI1dGI2SXhzbGZPNXZKMEY5VUUzT3NkU2IxbDRYUnN4MksyVGxTR0d6Q0dzdlRqQmJIb3ZjOHBwZVd4UTZ4WWtObExBRWR3ZXk3TmxpeXJnQ1ZLWmhqcUc3Z3VxQVlFdkxKLWk4OFFTOUR6bktlaW5iMlY4eXFTdjhhX3ZpZnZvMTQ1dzQ</guid></item><item><title>这款金毛猎犬是您需要的“机上娱乐” - DogTime</title><link>https://dogtime.com/news/197522-golden-retriever-flight-video-attention</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air travel can be a stressful experience for many passengers, whether due to long lines, tight spaces, or restless hours in the air. Yet very so often, something unexpected lightens the mood and brings a sense of joy to the cabin. On one recent flight, that moment came courtesy of a particularly charming &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; who stole the spotlight without even trying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-is-the-centre-of-attention-on-a-flight"&gt;Golden Retriever is the centre of attention on a flight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video opens with a shot down the aisle of a commercial flight. Standing calmly in the walkway is Bowie, a Golden Retriever on a leash who immediately captures the attention of everyone around him. As the camera slowly zooms in, the song “Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel” plays in the background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, text on the screen reads, “Heaven must be missing an angel… cuz he’s in seat 14B,” which only adds to the humor. Throughout the video, Bowie remains remarkably composed. He looks directly at the passenger filming him, giving soft, gentle glances as if he’s greeting each person individually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike most dogs who might be restless or overwhelmed on a plane, Bowie stands quietly and doesn’t fuss. His owner keeps a relaxed hold on the leash, clearly trusting Bowie to behave. The uploader captioned the video, “Your in-flight entertainment is just a golden retriever smiling at everyone,” and judging by the reaction online, viewers agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The comments poured in with both amusement and envy. One user wrote, “I’d pay double to sit next to him.” Another commented, “The best flight entertainment EVER,” insisting that Bowie outperformed any provided in-flight media. Someone else joked, “Is this what first class looks like?” while another viewer added, “I always pray to be on a flight with more cute dogs than angry people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are hoping to &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/reference/392-flying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fly with your&lt;/a&gt; own dog, experts recommend preparing well in advance. Airlines typically require pets to remain in carriers unless they are trained service animals, so checking each airline’s policy is crucial. It’s also vital to bring essentials like water, familiar blankets, and treats to help keep your dog comfortable. You’ll also want to check health documentation requirements and give your pup time to stretch and use the restroom before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So, by inhibiting PCSK9, these drugs increase the number of available receptors, improving the clearance of LDL cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike existing PCSK9 inhibitors, which are only available in an injectable form, the new drug, enlicitide, can be taken as a pill, making it more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/drmariaknobel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MBBS, a board certified lifestyle medicine doctor and medical director at Medical Cert UK, who was not involved in the research. She explained how important the pill format can be for some people:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals reluctant to have injections tend to be more consistent in taking a daily dose of pills. I tend to see an increase of adherence by approximately 20% amongst individuals who switch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the scientists recruited 303 people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. All participants were already taking statins, but their LDL cholesterol levels remained elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a multisite study, involving people from 59 sites in 17 countries. In total, 202 participants received enlicitide once per day for 52 weeks, and the remaining 101 received a placebo each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 24 weeks, 58.2% of those in the enlicitide group experienced an average drop in LDL cholesterol of 58.2%. In comparison, the average LDL cholesterol level increased by 2.6% in the placebo group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 52-week mark, the enlicitide group reduced their levels by an average of 55.3%, compared to an 8.7% rise in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also found that other lipid markers were improved to a similar degree:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non–high-density lipid (HDL) cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; (52.3% in the enlicitide group versus 2.1% in placebo): Non-HDL cholesterol is the total cholesterol level, minus HDL, or “good” cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apolipoprotein B (apo B)&lt;/strong&gt; (−48.2% versus 1.8%): Apo B helps carry LDL cholesterol around the body and is a marker for increased heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipoprotein(a)&lt;/strong&gt; (−24.7% versus −1.6%): A genetically determined risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; asked Knöbel about the significance of lowered lipoprotein(a). She explained that lipoprotein(a) is similar to LDL cholesterol, but it is even more difficult for the body to clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, she told us of patients who are regular exercisers with a healthy diet who still have stubbornly high levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to these dramatic improvements when compared with placebo, daily enlicitide resulted in almost identical changes in LDL, non-HDL, and ApoB to those achieved with the injectable antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab,” &lt;hl-trusted-source source="American Heart Associaiton" rationale="Highly respected national organization"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/investigational-daily-pill-lowered-bad-cholesterol-as-much-as-injectables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; lead author, Ann Marie Navar, MD, PhD, an associate professor of cardiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these results are impressive, longer and larger trials are needed to verify effectiveness in a broader group of participants. However, such a robust effect across all participants is heartening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, because the study focused on individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, it will be important to test the drug on people without the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/yu-ming-ni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Yu-Ming Ni&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board certified cardiologist and lipidologist, to ask whether enlicitide might work in other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This medication is in the same drug class as other established injectable PCSK9 inhibitors and appears to have a similar overall effect on cholesterol levels,” he explained. “Therefore, I do expect that it has similar efficacy on cholesterol in patients without genetically driven high cholesterol.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he also explained the importance of longer trials to see whether the reductions in LDL cholesterol are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ni is based at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA and was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also contacted &lt;a href="https://dietitianlive.com/team/trevor-coke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Trevor Coke II&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Dietician Live, who was not involved in the study. He was also upbeat about the results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a dietitian’s perspective, the possibility of an oral option that’s as effective as an injectable is exciting. It could make advanced cholesterol-lowering therapies more accessible, especially for people who are needle-averse or face barriers to injectable medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 07:56:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPeThmVmU1bzZUYlEyY0htdXluR3ptVFBvTllPYVVfNkdIOGpUSHRvTWN1STZNbnJIMjZEQjJBMENxbXJuUVZONnYwNEJDZERZek10LVhaWWpLWlJzQ3lQam4zWWQycXJoaEc3WEdPR1NDYWFoVGtURUVFQ1NEUTVCMVN4UWt6VjRsWlN1bzRQSkh1SVZ3a3BZanB5Y1Q1cXNMazJ3</guid></item><item><title>高血压补充剂清除小鼠阿尔茨海默氏症的迹象- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

(Fujii et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurochem. Int.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers bred male mice with Alzheimer's-like aggregations of amyloid-beta, then added arginine to the animals' drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arginine significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;reduced the protein build-up&lt;/a&gt; in the animals' brains and alleviated some of the related toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice given arginine also showed reduced behavioral abnormalities during tests and had less active neuroinflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the treatment may not be just scrubbing away the protein plaques; it could be reversing some of the harm being done to the brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments in fruit flies and test tubes added to the evidence that arginine could possibly clear out amyloid-beta clumps and stop them from forming in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already knew that arginine can act as a kind of chemical chaperone, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa115"&gt;preventing the abnormal misfolding&lt;/a&gt; and clumping of proteins, like those seen in Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies also show arginine can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305318"&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;, which is key for treating brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves here, it's important to note that the researchers used a relatively high dose of arginine in their animal tests, and more work needs to be done to figure out a safe treatment dose for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while mouse and fruit fly models are often good substitutes for human diseases, there's no guarantee that these findings are going to carry over. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73085" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;animal testing&lt;/a&gt; has produced encouraging results, and clinical trials can now be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;remains some uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; that clearing away amyloid-beta plaques can actually work as a way of treating Alzheimer's. These clumps are definitely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;harmful to neurons&lt;/a&gt;, but it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-alzheimers-years-ahead-of-first-symptoms"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; whether they're helping to drive Alzheimer's to begin with, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;signs of other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxic-tiny-rna-molecules-identified-as-culprit-in-alzheimers-neuron-death"&gt;at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats though, it's another encouraging step forward in our understanding of how Alzheimer's works and how we might be able to tackle it – another promising treatment option to add &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;to an ever-growing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2025.106082"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for millions of adults with age-related macular degeneration, that crucial, central field of sight is blurred beyond recognition. &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/promising-new-treatments-amd"&gt;Current treatments&lt;/a&gt; can only slow its progression or augment vision, but the blur will usually continue to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of a treatment based on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; transplants has found the procedure may be able to safely reverse the cumulative damage to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-fruit-could-reduce-chances-of-eye-disease-macular-degeneration"&gt;hard-working macula&lt;/a&gt; – that part of the retina &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;responsible for all you see directly in front of you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;Gold Injections in The Eye May Be The Future of Vision Preservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first time this particular stem cell treatment has been tested in humans, and as a phase 1/2a clinical trial, the main focus of the investigation was safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the treatment compared with existing therapies won't be known until at least the end of phase 3, but the preliminary results were positive enough that trials are proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier testing in the lab showed the transplant process was safe enough to proceed with in-human trials: the transplanted  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; retained their retinal identity, and no tumours or toxicity were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening 18 potentially eligible patients, the researchers enrolled six volunteers aged 71 to 86 who had been diagnosed with dry age-related macular degeneration (&lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;the most common type, making up around 80 percent of all macular degeneration cases&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the participants had worse vision in general, with visual acuity scores ranging from 20/200 to 20/800 (which means they could only see the first, biggest letter on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"&gt;Snellen chart&lt;/a&gt;, at best). The other three had scores between 20/70 and 20/200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the less common and more rapid 'wet' macular degeneration, the 'dry' form of the condition is a gradual loss of vision caused by tiny deposits of fats and proteins destroying the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"&gt;retinal pigment epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt; (RPEs) that support the eye's light-sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg" alt="diagram of macular degeneration" class="wp-image-183119 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram showing early stages of dry macular degeneration, caused by deposits of fats and proteins known as drusen beneath the RPE. (&lt;a href="https://www.mdfoundation.com.au/about-macular-disease/age-related-macular-degeneration/what-is-amd/"&gt;Macular Disease Foundation Australia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment involves surgically transplanting stem cells sourced from an eye bank that can produce new RPEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the trial's participants received a relatively low dose of 50,000 RPE stem cells through a single injection. The cells were inserted under the retina of the superior temporal macula in the patients' most-impaired eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the trial showed the treatment is safe, with no sign of the immune problems or tumors that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-stem-cell-test-may-reduce-tumour-risk-14932"&gt;can sometimes arise&lt;/a&gt; in stem cell transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adverse events were related to the stem cells themselves, though there were a few of the typical complications seen in this kind of eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, each patient experienced an improvement in vision in the eye that received the transplant that was not apparent in the other, suggesting the stem cells were doing exactly what scientists had hoped they would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after the treatment, the three participants who had the worst vision were able to see an average of 21 more letters on an eye chart than they had at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we were pleased with the safety data, the exciting part was that their vision was also improving," &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/adult-stem-cells-show-therapeutic-promise-treating-vision-loss-macular-degeneration"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rajesh Rao, a physician-scientist and ophthalmologist at Michigan Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised by the magnitude of vision gain in the most severely affected patients who received the adult stem cell-derived RPE transplants. This level of vision gain has not been seen in this group of patients with advanced dry AMD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is continuing to monitor patients who received higher doses (150,000 and 250,000 cells). If those doses are also deemed safe, it will help determine whether Rao and team can scale up human testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.08.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
