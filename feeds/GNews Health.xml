							&lt;p data-start="310" data-end="438"&gt;Staying mentally sharp isn’t just luck—it’s the byproduct of dozens of small choices that build on each other year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="440" data-end="771"&gt;I’ve met people in their 80s who can still debate politics with more clarity than people half their age, who remember old lyrics and recent headlines with equal sharpness, and who learn new apps faster than their grandkids. These aren’t outliers. They’ve cultivated habits that quietly protect their minds from dulling with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="773" data-end="917"&gt;The good news is that these habits aren’t exclusive to them. They’re accessible to anyone, and the earlier you start, the stronger the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="919" data-end="977"&gt;Here are nine of those habits worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="984" data-end="1021"&gt;1. They keep learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1088"&gt;Sharp older adults have one thing in common: they stay curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1090" data-end="1325"&gt;It doesn’t always mean going back to school. Sometimes it’s taking up watercolor painting, learning the basics of coding, or diving into podcasts on topics they know nothing about. The point is—they never stop being students of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1327" data-end="1538"&gt;As neuroscientist Dr. Michael Merzenich has said, “The brain is like a muscle. If you don’t give it a workout, it will weaken.” That workout doesn’t come from passive consumption—it comes from active learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1540" data-end="1919"&gt;When I was traveling through Portugal, I stayed with a couple in their 70s who had just started studying astronomy. Every evening, they’d set up a telescope and try to identify constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1540" data-end="1919"&gt;They weren’t doing it for recognition or to “stay young.” They were simply curious. And that curiosity made their conversations lively, their memory sharp, and their thinking flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1921" data-end="2006"&gt;The key takeaway? Never stop learning—even if you’re the oldest person in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2013" data-end="2059"&gt;2. They challenge their memory on purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2061" data-end="2178"&gt;The brain thrives on friction. Sharp-minded seniors understand this, so they give their memory deliberate exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2180" data-end="2467"&gt;Crosswords, Sudoku, memory games, even something as basic as recalling a shopping list without writing it down—all these small challenges add up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2180" data-end="2467"&gt;Researchers emphasize that &lt;a href="https://www.sherringford.org/post/boost-your-brainpower-the-science-of-active-recall-retrieval-practice?.com"&gt;active recall&lt;/a&gt;—retrieving information from memory—fortifies neural pathways far more effectively than passive review. This phenomenon, known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect?.com"&gt;testing effect&lt;/a&gt;, is well-supported by decades of cognitive research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2469" data-end="2706"&gt;A friend of mine has a quirky daily ritual: he memorizes three phone numbers every morning, just to see if he can recall them by evening. Sounds trivial, right? But those small sparks of effort build resilience into his memory network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2940"&gt;And here’s the secret—memory exercises don’t have to be boring. They can come through song lyrics, trivia nights, or even trying to remember recipes without checking the book. The point isn’t perfection—it’s the act of stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2947" data-end="2986"&gt;3. They nurture strong social ties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2988" data-end="3190"&gt;Loneliness is one of the most dangerous threats to mental health. Not just emotionally—but cognitively. Multiple studies link isolation with faster cognitive decline and even higher risks of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3192" data-end="3394"&gt;The people who stay sharp into their 80s are usually the ones who make time for connection. They grab coffee with friends, join local walking groups, or volunteer where conversation naturally happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3396" data-end="3801"&gt;I once met a retired teacher in San Francisco who told me, “I don’t miss the job. I miss the staffroom debates.” To fill that gap, he started a weekly discussion group at his library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3396" data-end="3801"&gt;Every Thursday, ten or so people show up to talk about current events, books, and sometimes even conspiracy theories. He laughed when he said, “The best part is, I have to stay on my toes. Someone always challenges me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3803" data-end="3884"&gt;That mental engagement—listening, arguing, adapting—acts as fuel for his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3891" data-end="3921"&gt;4. They move their bodies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3923" data-end="4210"&gt;It’s impossible to separate brain health from body health. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, improves mood, and supports memory. You don’t have to run marathons or deadlift huge weights to see the benefits. Even brisk walking, swimming, or yoga makes a measurable difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4212" data-end="4364"&gt;As noted in a landmark randomized controlled trial published in &lt;em data-start="64" data-end="70"&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, one year of &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1015950108?.com"&gt;moderate aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; increased the volume of the anterior hippocampus by around 2%, effectively reversing age-related loss by about 1–2 years—and significantly improved spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4366" data-end="4576"&gt;I’ve noticed it myself. If I fall out of my exercise routine, I get sluggish not just physically but mentally. Concentration feels harder. Ideas don’t flow as easily. Movement is brain fuel, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4578" data-end="4863"&gt;And some older adults make it fun. A woman I met in her 70s in Mexico City had joined a salsa dancing group. She admitted she wasn’t very good, but the combination of music, movement, and socializing lit her up. She said it made her feel “10 years younger.” Honestly, I believed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4870" data-end="4924"&gt;5. They embrace technology instead of avoiding it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4926" data-end="5124"&gt;Sharp older adults don’t hide from technology. They may not love every new gadget, but they lean in. Whether it’s texting, video calls, or exploring online forums, they adapt instead of resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5126" data-end="5405"&gt;I once helped my uncle set up a music streaming app. At first, he said, “This is too complicated.” But once he got the hang of it, he started curating playlists of his favorite 70s records and texting them to me. A month later, he was recommending bands I hadn’t even heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5407" data-end="5654"&gt;This openness doesn’t just keep older adults socially connected. It keeps their brains flexible. Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://psychology.tips/cognitive-flexibility/?.com"&gt;“cognitive flexibility”&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to switch between tasks and perspectives. And it’s a huge predictor of mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5656" data-end="5767"&gt;So while some shrug off new tech as unnecessary, the people who thrive embrace it as another chance to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5774" data-end="5807"&gt;6. They practice mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5809" data-end="5904"&gt;Mindfulness has gone from a trendy buzzword to a scientifically backed tool for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5906" data-end="6230"&gt;Meditation, mindful breathing, or simply slowing down to notice details in daily life helps reduce stress, sharpen attention, and improve memory. As Dr. Richard Davidson, founder of the Center for Healthy Minds, explains: “Attention is the building block of learning. If we strengthen attention, everything else improves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6469"&gt;Not every sharp older adult sits cross-legged chanting “om.” Some simply build small mindfulness rituals: writing down three things they’re grateful for, gardening slowly and attentively, or pausing for a few deep breaths before meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6471" data-end="6574"&gt;What matters is training the mind to focus. In a world of constant distraction, that ability is gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6581" data-end="6607"&gt;7. They stay creative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6609" data-end="6802"&gt;Creativity keeps the brain elastic. When you create—whether through painting, writing, carpentry, or playing music—you activate neural pathways that strengthen problem-solving and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6804" data-end="7040"&gt;When I visited Japan, I met an 80-something woman who wrote a haiku every morning. She didn’t call herself a poet. She just said, “It keeps my thoughts sharp.” And it showed—her mind was lively, her humor quick, her presence magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7042" data-end="7316"&gt;This is a pattern I’ve seen over and over again. The act of creating—not the quality of the output—is what matters. You don’t have to be Picasso. Doodling, journaling, even building a birdhouse counts. Creativity is less about talent and more about staying mentally agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7323" data-end="7357"&gt;8. They prioritize good sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7359" data-end="7430"&gt;Here’s a subtle truth: sharp older adults guard their sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7432" data-end="7630"&gt;Sleep isn’t wasted time. It’s when the brain consolidates memories and clears out toxins that build up during the day. Poor sleep is linked to worse focus, weaker memory, and higher dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7632" data-end="7830"&gt;The sharpest people I know in their 70s and 80s take sleep seriously. They keep regular schedules, avoid late caffeine, and often have wind-down rituals like reading or listening to calming music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7832" data-end="8019"&gt;One man told me he uses a simple rule: no screens after 9 p.m. “If I don’t see the news cycle,” he said, “my brain actually rests.” He swore it was his secret to waking up with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8026" data-end="8078"&gt;9. They stay curious about people and the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8080" data-end="8128"&gt;This might be the most important habit of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8130" data-end="8341"&gt;The people who stay sharp don’t shrink their world down to nostalgia or routine. They keep asking questions. They talk to younger people. They pay attention to culture, politics, technology, and human stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8343" data-end="8529"&gt;Curiosity fuels growth. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “At a child’s birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift should be curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8531" data-end="8753"&gt;Sharp older adults never stop exercising that gift. They don’t just tell stories from the past—they want to know what’s happening now, and what’s coming next. That openness keeps them alert, engaged, and mentally strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8760" data-end="8780"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8782" data-end="8909"&gt;Mental sharpness into old age isn’t an accident. It’s the result of deliberate choices—small habits that add up over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8911" data-end="9055"&gt;From learning new things and challenging their memory, to moving their bodies and staying curious, these practices are available to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9057" data-end="9271"&gt;The earlier you adopt them, the more they pay off. But it’s never too late to start. Even small changes—like memorizing a grocery list, joining a dance class, or cutting off screens before bed—can ripple forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9273" data-end="9342"&gt;The question is: which of these habits can you put into play today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;						&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;h1 class="article-page-headline"&gt;Gruesome simulation reveals what 'the black death' does to the body - as American patient tests positive for plague&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="author-section byline-plain"&gt;By &lt;a href="/profile-3963/elen-johnston.html" class="author"&gt;ELEN JOHNSTON, HEALTH REPORTER&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="byline-section"&gt;&lt;span class="article-timestamp article-timestamp-published"&gt; &lt;span class="article-timestamp-label"&gt;Published:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;time datetime="2025-08-26T17:13:48+0100"&gt; 12:13 EDT, 26 August 2025 &lt;/time&gt; &lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class="article-timestamp article-timestamp-updated"&gt; &lt;span class="article-timestamp-label"&gt;Updated:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;time datetime="2025-08-26T17:14:34+0100"&gt; 12:14 EDT, 26 August 2025 &lt;/time&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                  
    
                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     
          
          
          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An illuminating video has captured in alarming detail exactly what happens to the body after catching the plague. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medieval illness—one of the most deadly in history—ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1351 and killed tens of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of the condition, dubbed the black death, today are rare, with modern antibiotics drastically reducing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But officials were alarmed last week after an unidentified adult in the US tested positive for the plague and was recovering at home after receiving medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed an infected flea bit the patient, who was camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. No other information on their condition was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the minute-long &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BH8y7Pmq-g"&gt;YouTube video published&lt;/a&gt; by Zack D. Films—who boasts 23 million subscribers—has shown how the bacterial infection passes through the body and affects different limbs, without any treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you got bitten by a flea, a bacterium would enter your body and begin to multiply quickly,' it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They would head to your lymph nodes, causing them to swell up and forming painful bumps in your armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The video simulation shows in gruesome detail what happens to the body once it is infected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A person living near Lake Tahoe (pictured) tested positive for the plague (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is carried by fleas and transmitted between animals. The picture above is a 3D illustration of the bacterium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The bacteria can also get into your bloodstream, causing bleeding under your skin. This bleeding makes your skin turn dark and black in certain spots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simulation then shows the person's finger tips becoming black before spreading slowly across the limbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left untreated, the infection can ravage enters the bloodstream and travels to the lungs, causing deadly infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the disease enters cells, it kills them by releasing deadly toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reacting to the video, users expressed their shock at how quickly the infection spreads.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why I'm grateful to have been born in this era. Where medicine and science are advanced enough to handle situations like this,' one wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show there have been no cases of the plague found in the UK since 1918.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of an infected person returning to Britain from abroad is low, the agency says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It still occurs in several countries in Africa, Asia, South America and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the US &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;recorded their first plague death&lt;/a&gt; since 2007, in Arizona.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are three forms of the plague: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the most common is the bubonic plague, named after 'buboes', the painful swollen bumps the infection causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms that develop one to seven days after infection include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, fatigue, weakness, vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;As annoying as catching a cold may be, there could be a silver lining. New research suggests that it may temporarily protect you from getting covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers revealed that individuals, especially children, who had recently been infected by a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rhinoviruses/about/index.html"&gt;rhinovirus&lt;/a&gt;—the most frequent culprit behind the common cold—were remarkably less likely to get a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes covid-19, in the following weeks. These results might shed light onto why children have lower chances of developing covid symptoms than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An ‘early advantage’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold,” Max Seibold, Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health, said in a National Jewish Health &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/about-us/news/press-releases/2025-news/common-cold-may-protect-against-covid-19#:~:text=DENVER%20%2D%20A%20new%20study%20led,virus%20that%20causes%20COVID%2D19."&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seibold and his colleagues detailed their results in a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf374/8230147?login=true"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, after analyzing data that tracked over 4,100 people in 1,394 households from May 2020 to February 2021. They tested thousands of self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, such as rhinovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Built-in boost&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhinoviruses trigger &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/interferon"&gt;interferons&lt;/a&gt;—natural agents that fight against infection and diseases—in our airways. This reaction can give the immune system a temporary boost, leaving it better equipped to handle other viruses that show up. In fact, to further investigate how recent viral infections impact the body’s antiviral defenses, the team also studied gene &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Gene-Expression"&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt; (when genetic information is translated into a function) in people’s airways and found children had a higher baseline expression of genes related to interferons than adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Based on these findings, we hypothesize that interferons induced by prior viral respiratory infections may prime the airways of children with high levels of antiviral defense proteins, resulting in reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and better clinical outcomes compared to adults,” the researchers explained in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, “has been observed for other respiratory viruses, but has yet to be demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2,” the scientists added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Camille Moore, lead author of the study and a biostatistician at National Jewish Health, explained that “understanding how one virus can affect the body’s response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations,” she said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moore also clarifies that this doesn’t mean people should start trying to catch a cold. And if you think that’s an obvious warning, you clearly don’t know humans very well.&lt;/p&gt;

And because its code is so different, it is less likely to mix with natural organisms, easing safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This breakthrough could also pave the way for new medicines, advanced materials and synthetic lifeforms beyond anything seen in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The microbe, named Syn57, is a lab-engineered version of Escherichia coli, a bacterium that can naturally cause infections in the gut, urinary tract and other areas of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To tackle this huge project, scientists divided the genome into 38 pieces, each about 100,000 DNA letters long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They built each piece in yeast and then inserted it into E coli using a method called uREXER, which combines CRISPR-Cas9 and other tools to swap in synthetic DNA in one step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some genome regions slowed growth or resisted changes, but the team solved these issues by adjusting gene sequences, untangling overlapping genes, and carefully choosing which codons to swap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Step by step, the fragments were stitched together into the final, fully synthetic bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The result, Syn57, is the most heavily redesigned organism ever made, demonstrating that life can survive with a much smaller, simpler genetic code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wesley Robertson, a synthetic biologist at the Medical Research Council Laboratory in the UK, told the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/science/dna-genetics-engineering-microbes.html"&gt; New York Times&lt;/a&gt;: 'We definitely went through these periods where we were like, 'Well, will this be a dead end, or can we see this through?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57 is alive, but barely. While normal E. coli can double in an hour, Syn57 takes four, making it 'extremely feeble,' Yonatan Chemla, a synthetic biologist at MIT who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria grew on a jelly-like surface and in a nutritious liquid, but at four times slower than their natural counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robertson and his team are now experimenting to see if they can make it grow faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If successful, scientists could eventually program it to do tasks that ordinary bacteria cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the 20 standard amino acids that all life uses to make proteins, chemists can create hundreds of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57's seven missing codons could potentially be reassigned to these unnatural amino acids, allowing the bacterium to produce new drugs or other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57 could also make engineered microbes safer for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microbes swap genes easily, which can be risky if engineered DNA spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a gene from Syn57 would be gibberish to natural bacteria because of its unique genetic code, preventing it from being used outside the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:19:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRWpWNG9SZ3pZMHBJalJoZ3lUOHBhMlRCOWs2cTFzQmdTR1BpdjFWMUpkZld1VjlnT2NMQXdlbVJqWmpuUFFyNDdMdFIwSVpFTG56YjBha0NjQlpHTE8wdDc2dWF0eGdrZVktX2RiLXdJR3Z4X0dsV25VamlQWkhmaFMxSnFHR2JHa2lqTGVySl9GaFJQdTdRY3VsWmllb1pVVVRUb2VTZWN1NWM</guid></item><item><title>美国有新的高血压指南。这就是它的含义。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/us-has-new-guidelines-for-high-blood-pressure-heres-what-that-means</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; comprehensive review of the latest research on hypertension, b&lt;/span&gt;lood pressure guidelines in the US have been updated to cut risks of heart disease and dementia later in life further than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The updated guidelines replace a previous revision &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-change-what-high-blood-pressure-hypertension-is"&gt;conducted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and are a joint effort from the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and other respected institutions in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes are modifications to existing recommendations for healthcare professionals, targeting individuals who already fall into risk categories, have relevant medical conditions, or are pregnant. Though in their entirety, the recommendations remain relevant to everybody, regardless of their current state of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-common-blood-pressure-drug-extends-lifespan-slows-aging-in-animals"&gt;This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan, Slows Aging in Animals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One innovative tool introduced in the updated guidelines is the PREVENT (Predicting Risk of CVD Events) score; a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-weekend-habit-may-cut-risk-of-heart-related-death-by-33-study-finds"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; calculator based on data from 3.2 million diverse individuals collected between 1992 and 2022. The score is expected to help assess risk for a broader range of potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-dementia-linked-to-brain-abnormalities-from-high-blood-pressure"&gt;continues to grow&lt;/a&gt; that high blood pressure puts individuals at an increased risk of cardiovascular and neurological diseases, not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;potential problems&lt;/a&gt; with the kidneys, the eyes, and the body's metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High blood pressure is the most prevalent and modifiable risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and all-cause mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the newly issued guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings"&gt;Blood pressure readings&lt;/a&gt; tell you the pressure of your blood against the walls of your arteries. They come in two parts: the larger number that comes first is systolic blood pressure (the pressure as the heart beats), and the smaller second number is diastolic blood pressure (the pressure between heart beats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171851" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure.jpg" alt="Blood pressure guidelines" class="wp-image-171851 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure-489x415.jpg 489w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure-600x509.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171851" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the new guidelines.

Stage 1 is classed as 130-139 mm Hg systolic, or 80-89 mm Hg diastolic; anything above that in either figure is stage 2. When you get to above 180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic, you need to call your doctor right away, or the emergency services if you've got symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; or shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you hit &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, the guidelines say, a doctor may need to prescribe medication. In Europe, treatments usually don't begin until the 140/90 mm Hg threshold is reached, unless other health factors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overarching blood pressure treatment goal is &amp;lt;130/80 mm Hg for all adults, with additional considerations for those who require institutional care, have a limited predicted lifespan, or are pregnant," the guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifestyle recommendations are unchanged, and apply to everyone: keep up the exercise, eat a healthy diet relatively low in sodium, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-suggests-even-moderate-drinking-is-linked-with-brain-damage"&gt;drink alcohol in moderation&lt;/a&gt; (if at all), and manage your stress levels to reduce blood pressure. Even better, check in with friends and family too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians should collaborate with community leaders, health systems, and practices to implement screening of all adults in their communities and implement guideline-based recommendations regarding prevention and management of high blood pressure to improve rates of blood pressure control," the guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypertension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not a milk drinker? Not a problem. There are still expert-approved ways to get calcium in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's crucial to get enough calcium, because it's essential for bone health. The mineral makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. It's also important for muscle function and nerve signaling, registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Meggie Connelly&lt;/a&gt; told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults, the NIH recommends about 1,000 to 1,200 mg of calcium daily — but, dairy milk isn't the only way to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other dairy products like yogurt and cheese also contain calcium, as do non-dairy milks fortified with calcium, Connelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu made with calcium is another way to get both the bone-supporting mineral plus protein. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other calcium-fortified options include fruit juices and cereals, the NIH adds. For example, the NIH estimates one cup of orange juice fortified with calcium provides the same amount of calcium (about 27% of your daily value) as 8 ounces of low fat yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one cup of nonfat milk is about the same as an equal serving of calcium-fortified soy milk, according to the institute's estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of &lt;a href="http://www.drnutritionchanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Nutrition Changer&lt;/a&gt;, said canned fish with bones, like salmon or sardines, also provide calcium. And, you can even get it from some vegetables, Jiang added, like kale, broccoli and bok choy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know where you stand with your calcium intake, Connelly said if your plate looks colorful and balanced most of the time (think, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, proteins, dairy or calcium-fortified plant milks), "you're probably in a good place."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, some people can still fall short on nutrients like calcium, vitamin D and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/red-meat-iron-sources-food-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; despite balanced meals — "especially for women, those with certain health conditions or plant-based eaters," Connelly added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're worried about your calcium levels, experts suggested consulting your doctor about supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources," Jiang said. "This helps us get the most benefits of all sorts of nutrients while minimizing the risk of overconsumption."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study involving DNA analysis of Beethoven’s remains has provided fresh insights into the composer’s health, genetic lineage, and possible causes behind his legendary hearing loss. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study, led by biochemist Johannes Krause at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, explored Beethoven’s genetic makeup in an effort to uncover the mysteries of his declining health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beethoven’s Health and Genetic Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s health &lt;/strong&gt;has long been a subject of fascination for historians, biographers, and medical experts alike. Most famously, the composer experienced progressive &lt;strong&gt;hearing loss &lt;/strong&gt;starting in his mid-to-late twenties, eventually becoming functionally deaf by 1818. The loss of his hearing didn’t stop him from composing some of the world’s most iconic music, but it did raise questions about the causes behind this condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/983032" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a press statement released in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, biochemist &lt;strong&gt;Johannes Krause&lt;/strong&gt; noted, “Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethoven’s health problems, which famously include progressive hearing loss, beginning in his mid- to late-20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818.” The research team hoped to identify genetic factors that could explain these conditions, but Krause admitted that they were unable to find a definitive cause for Beethoven’s hearing loss or his gastrointestinal problems, which he struggled with throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of a clear answer, the study’s findings offer a glimpse into the&lt;strong&gt; genetic makeup&lt;/strong&gt; of one of history’s most influential composers, adding another layer to the understanding of his extraordinary life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Insights into Beethoven’s Family Lineage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study didn’t find conclusive evidence linking &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s deafness to a genetic disorder&lt;/strong&gt;, it did provide a fascinating look at his family’s genetic history. One of the most intriguing findings from the research was the revelation of a genetic event that occurred in Beethoven’s paternal line several generations before his birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tristan Begg&lt;/strong&gt;, a biological anthropologist involved in the study, explained, “This finding suggests an extrapair paternity event in his paternal line between the conception of&lt;strong&gt; Hendrik van Beethoven in Kampenhout&lt;/strong&gt;, Belgium in c.1572 and the conception of &lt;strong&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven &lt;/strong&gt;seven generations later in 1770, in Bonn, Germany.” Essentially, the analysis indicated that an extramarital affair or affair involving Beethoven’s paternal ancestors could have contributed to a complex genetic heritage that stretches back centuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this finding doesn’t necessarily offer direct insights into &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s health issues&lt;/strong&gt;, it sheds light on the potential genetic diversity within his family. Understanding the genealogy of such a prominent historical figure adds nuance to our understanding of his life and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beethoven’s Genetic Markers and Health Complications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another crucial element of the research involved analyzing the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/genetic-evidence-leprosy-ancient-american/" data-type="post" data-id="84205"&gt; genetic markers&lt;/a&gt; related to diseases that could have affected&lt;strong&gt; Beethoven’s health&lt;/strong&gt;. The study looked at various genes associated with hearing loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and other ailments that the composer endured. Though the researchers didn’t identify a definitive cause for his hearing loss or chronic abdominal issues, they noted several genetic markers that could have contributed to his overall health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings support the hypothesis that Beethoven may have had a hereditary predisposition to certain health problems. It’s also possible that environmental factors, such as his diet, stress levels, or even infections, played a role in exacerbating his conditions. Unfortunately, the study did not uncover any clear genetic connection to&lt;strong&gt; Beethoven’s well-known health struggles&lt;/strong&gt;, but it provided valuable data for future research into genetic disorders of similar nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Intersection of Genetics and Artistry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research on &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s DNA &lt;/strong&gt;also highlights the fascinating intersection between genetics and creativity. Many have wondered how Beethoven, despite his worsening hearing loss, was able to continue composing music at the highest level. His ability to produce groundbreaking symphonies and piano concertos despite his deafness has been a source of inspiration for many.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study did not pinpoint a genetic factor that could explain Beethoven’s extraordinary artistic abilities, the sheer complexity of his genetic history raises intriguing possibilities. Could his lineage or certain genetic traits have contributed to his exceptional creativity and resilience in the face of adversity? These questions remain unanswered but serve as a reminder of the mysterious relationship between genetics, health, and talent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Legacy of Beethoven’s Health and Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study of &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s DNA &lt;/strong&gt;is just one part of a broader effort to understand the composer’s life, health, and legacy. While much is still unknown about the specific causes of his health issues, the research has contributed significantly to the ongoing dialogue surrounding Beethoven’s genius and struggles. The analysis also offers a glimpse into the broader field of genetic research on historical figures, shedding light on the possibilities and limitations of genetic analysis in understanding the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Even though the research team was unable to pinpoint a clear explanation for Beethoven’s health problems, the study has opened up new avenues for understanding the intersections of health, history, and genetics. In many ways, Beethoven’s health challenges are as enigmatic as his music, and this study provides a valuable step forward in unlocking the secrets of both.&lt;/p&gt;

Sadly, one truth is well-known: As we age, so does our brain. Because this all-important organ filled with 86 billion neurons forms our experience, dysregulation within the brain has outsized impacts on someone’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, scientists have tried to find ways to stave off these negative effects and make a person’s healthspan largely match their ever-increasing &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65637132/immortality-singularity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lifespan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.

By analyzing how &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a35884787/humans-share-genes-with-weird-headless-creatures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; and proteins changed over time in mice, the team identified a troublesome protein named ferritin light chain 1, or FTL1. When scientists reduced the presence of this protein in the hippocampus, the mice regained some of their youthful characteristics, including improved nerve connections and better permorfance on memory tests. The results of the study were published &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00940-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65865756%2Faging-brain%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the journal Nature Aging;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the journal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments […]. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, a co-author of the study from UCSF, said &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in a press statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in a press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age.

When analyzing the effects of FTL1 protein in a petri dish, Villeda and his team discerned that nerve cells engineered simple, one armed neural wires—known as “neurites”—rather than the branching neurites typical of normal neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“To identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65583845/study-finds-reverse-aging-in-humans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; brain,” the authors wrote. “It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors also note that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms7760&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65865756%2Faging-brain%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2015 study;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;a 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; found that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively impacted cognitive performance and accurately predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/gaming/a14393872/video-games-prevent-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers hope that by targeting FTL1, future therapies may not only improve natural cognitive decline, but will also benefit people with neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As this study—and many studies before it—have clearly demonstrated, there is no singular cause of mental decline. But with each new study, scientists work toward a holistic picture of neurodegenerative decline as we age, and with that new perspective comes the hope of new therapies that could make cognitive decline a thing of the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNUktTd3hMbGdTNFpwd1I4TDBSUDJYRzdDRERiSUdYeGxnTmRReU1tX2pjLTR2VmVzNmRxOTRnNS05Z0REUDhpaFBwbVlzbHNKUDVhWURfVDh2RUFYRm5jNmZvM3g5N2Fnb3ljVktLa1JLRE5pV0FTQ1FvVS1RVXdUc0d1NXo3VXV2d1pRLVRvN0k</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心悄悄缩减了食源性疾病的监测计划- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e97236" class="body-graf"&gt;A federal-state partnership that monitors for foodborne illnesses quietly scaled back its operations nearly two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffe6b5" class="body-graf"&gt;As of July 1, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network&lt;/a&gt; (FoodNet) program has reduced surveillance to just two pathogens: salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b760a" class="body-graf"&gt;Before July, the program had been tracking infections caused by six additional pathogens: campylobacter, cyclospora, listeria, shigella, vibrio and Yersinia. Some of them can lead to severe or life-threatening illnesses, particularly for newborns and people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11d871" class="body-graf"&gt;Monitoring for the six pathogens is no longer required for the 10 states that participate in the program, though those states aren’t precluded from conducting surveillance on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-646ede" class="body-graf"&gt;Food safety experts worry that the move, which hasn’t previously been made public, could make it harder for public health officials to notice whether certain foodborne illnesses are rising and then slow response time to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82c2b1" class="body-graf"&gt;FoodNet is a collaboration among the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and 10 state health departments. Its surveillance area covers roughly 54 million people, or 16% of the U.S. population. The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and select counties in California and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-747166" class="body-graf"&gt;“Although FoodNet will narrow its focus to &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent,” the CDC spokesperson wrote. “Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3813e3" class="body-graf"&gt;A list of talking points the CDC provided to the Connecticut Public Health Department, viewed by NBC News, cites a reason for the change: “Funding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9263d" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC spokesperson said Monday that other systems conduct national surveillance for the six pathogens that were removed from FoodNet. For instance, state health departments are still able to report cases through the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt;. And the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/php/surveillance/listeria-initiative.html" target="_blank"&gt;Listeria Initiative&lt;/a&gt; collects reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis — serious infections from eating food contaminated with listeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1db3a" class="body-graf"&gt;But FoodNet is the only surveillance system that actively looks for multiple foodborne diseases at the federal level, according to food safety experts. Other federal surveillance systems are passive, meaning the CDC relies on state health departments to notify it of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aeeb8d" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts worry that without active surveillance of all eight pathogens, public health officials won’t be able to adequately compare trends over time or notice whether cases of a particular illness start rising. Experts also worry that scaling back FoodNet’s operations could make it harder to quickly identify and respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dfed0" class="body-graf"&gt;Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University, called the decision to reduce FoodNet surveillance “very disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-839248" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of the work that I and many, many, many, many other people have put into improving food safety over the past 20 or 30 years is just going away,” she said. Kowalcyk’s son died in 2001 of complications from a foodborne E. coli infection, and since then she has advocated for improvements to U.S. food safety policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2a792" class="body-graf"&gt;Kowalcyk said that the federal budget for food safety hasn’t kept up with the cost of inflation and that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trump-administrations-deep-cuts-to-public-health-leave-system-reeling" target="_blank"&gt;cuts to federal funding for state health departments&lt;/a&gt; have most likely made it harder to maintain FoodNet surveillance. The CDC requested a $72 million &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2026/fy-2026-cdc-cj.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;budget for food safety&lt;/a&gt; for the 2026 fiscal year, about the same as it has requested in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd6879" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not entirely clear how the changes to FoodNet are affecting surveillance on the state level so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-651cc4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Oregon and Connecticut health departments said they were aware of the changes as of Monday. Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Health Department said Friday that it hadn’t received any official notice from the CDC. And the New Mexico Health Department said it was awaiting notification from the CDC to determine the scope of its future surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-315df3" class="body-graf"&gt;The Maryland Health Department said the state’s health care providers and clinical laboratories are required to report cases of all eight pathogens monitored by FoodNet, so the reporting will continue “regardless of changes to the FoodNet network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4bdcd" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it will need to scale back active surveillance activities for some pathogens if funding is decreased in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:12:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOQVNudmwwVnZ1Tl9ZWjB4OUxvZHNFLWJxdW1PdGlnT2lIV1E2V1pZZ2E5Y25udS02Q01GQUZseGExdnZTcVYxUGdXRk1PT1A5emxJMWlaRFBncWpROGRyTFRZX3dOY3VEM0Q4MXB1NE0tRVdZU3FPWmp1UVl1c0lYdXZsaVptVEk1TEo1eGhjUnpzUUR5QXVpYjdhX3Z0SjhxdnB1OXdaZnNCUE04RmdlUHdSd0hsREtzVXfSAVZBVV95cUxPamdORWh6emFhcy1IR1EyX0NTRmxXNVJPMlY3X1FFYjFjNXc3bEJ3ZHhfVzNTMDF4aHBRXzlydUcwNzJ0a1BBNlpOempWQU40WmozS3hoQQ</guid></item><item><title>与精神病和成瘾相关的高THC大麻-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/thc-psychosis-addiction-29615/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A systematic review of nearly 100 studies found that high-THC cannabis products are linked to negative mental health outcomes, particularly psychosis, schizophrenia, and cannabis use disorder. While some therapeutic research hinted at benefits for anxiety and depression, results were inconsistent and often showed potential harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence suggests higher THC concentrations carry greater risks, reinforcing concerns about high-potency cannabis use. Researchers emphasize that stronger, better-designed studies are essential to give clearer guidance to patients and healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychosis Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; High-THC cannabis is strongly associated with psychosis, schizophrenia, and cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed Findings:&lt;/strong&gt; Some studies suggest potential therapeutic benefit for anxiety and depression, but many show harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Current research lacks definitive answers, highlighting the need for improved study design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American College of Physicians&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A systematic review analyzed associations of high-concentration delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis products with mental health outcomes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review found that high-concentration THC products are associated with unfavorable mental health outcomes, particularly for psychosis or schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder (CUD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112433"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a featured brain and a cannabis leaf." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/THC-psychosis-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;High-concentration cannabis products were defined as having THC concentration exceeding 5 mg THC or 10% THC per serving or products described as “high-potency concentrate,” “shatter,” or “dab.” Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are limitations to currently available evidence and the researchers call for studies with improved designs to provide more accurate guidance for clinicians and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review is published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and colleagues analyzed 99 studies comprising 221,097 participants completed between 1977 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study selection was intentionally broad and included studies examining associations between high-concentration cannabis products and mental health outcomes regardless of whether the study had the purpose of evaluating therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-concentration cannabis products were defined as having THC concentration exceeding 5 mg THC or 10% THC per serving or products described as “high-potency concentrate,” “shatter,” or “dab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mental health outcomes of interest included anxiety, depression, psychosis, schizophrenia, CUD and other substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers defined acute effects (within 12 hours), post-acute effects (after consistent use for 1 to 2 months), and long-term effects (after consistent use for &amp;gt; 1 year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies not testing for therapeutic effects, high concentration THC products were associated with psychosis, schizophrenia, and cannabis use disorder. No therapeutic studies found favorable effects on psychosis or schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of non-therapeutic studies, 53% identified unfavorable associations with anxiety and 41% found unfavorable associations with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among therapeutic studies, some suggested beneficial effects for anxiety (47%) and depression (48%), while others suggested unfavorable effects (24% for anxiety and 30% for depression).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings reinforce previous conclusions that higher THC concentrations increase the risk for adverse mental health outcomes; however, they fall short of providing the definitive evidence needed to provide clear advice to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis and THC research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9adbd9f5f6f6f5f7dafbf9eaf5f4f6f3f4ffb4f5e8fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angela Collom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://acponline.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Physicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angela Collom – American College of Physicians&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;High-Concentration Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Cannabis Products and Mental Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review&lt;/a&gt;” by Jonathan M.

Results were categorized by association direction and by study characteristics. Therapeutic studies were defined by use of cannabis to treat medical conditions or symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Data Synthesis:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-nine studies (221 097 participants) were included: randomized trials (42%), observational studies (47%), and other interventional study designs (11%); more than 95% had moderate or high risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies not testing for therapeutic effects, high-concentration THC products showed consistent unfavorable associations with psychosis or schizophrenia (70%) and CUD (75%). No therapeutic studies reported favorable results for psychosis or schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anxiety and depression, 53% and 41% of nontherapeutic studies, respectively, reported unfavorable associations, especially among healthy populations. Among therapeutic studies, nearly half found benefits for anxiety (47%) and depression (48%), although some also found unfavorable associations (24% and 30%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitation:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate and high risk of bias of individual studies and limited evaluation of contemporary products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-concentration THC products are associated with unfavorable mental health outcomes, particularly for psychosis or schizophrenia and CUD.

The defective cells can also accumulate, preventing the development of red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes anaemia, leading to breathlessness, fatigue and, as Mr Blackburn experienced, kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst the cancer can be treated, it cannot yet be cured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Blackburn's stem cell transplant involved healthy bone marrow cells from a donor being introduced to the bloodstream, helping the body produce fully functioning white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a gruelling treatment,' Mr Blackburn recalled. 'It seriously affected my life, I lost weight, strength, stamina  and my hair—I could barely walk across the room.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The avid cyclist was quickly diagnosed with kidney failure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The avid cyclist also required regular dialysis—a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned before being filtered back into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, common side-effects of the treatment include fatigue, low blood pressure, muscle cramps, joint pain and difficulties sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To begin with, I'd have severe headaches and nausea,' Mr Blackburn said. 'I would spending evenings after dialysis throwing up before sleeping for 12 hours.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thankfully, the treatment worked and Mr Burton was given the all clear in October 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, he still needs three hour-long dialysis sessions a week to keep his kidney functioning properly, which he says has had a 'huge impact' on his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his stem cell treatment, Mr Blackburn was determined to build up his strength, despite feeling that he would never be strong enough to ride again with his cycling group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I realised I was really missing the social aspect and decided to purchase an eclectic bike to help me keep up,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Further tests revealed that his kidneys were failing as a result of a rare but aggressive blood cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tim underwent nine gruelling months of chemotherapy and relentless dialysis sessions before he was given the all clear in October 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tim still has to have three dialysis sessions a week to keep his body functioning properly whilst he waits for a kidney replacement &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Blackburn has since cycled over 200 miles across Somerset and Devon while visiting dialysis centres—to raise money for Kidney Research UK, in a challenge he dubbed 'Tour de Kidney'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He initially aimed to raise £2,040—£5 for each of the 408 dialysis sessions he has had since January 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he has since tripled his goal, raising £6,205 through &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/tim-blackburn-3"&gt;JustGiving&lt;/a&gt; in aid of research into the prevention, treatment and management of kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I had a great time and felt a huge feeling of satisfaction in what we've achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The staff at the dialysis clinics were all wonderful, giving me a cheer when I arrived and set back off again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was hard work, there were a lot of gills to cycle up, but it was very rewarding.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of myeloma can vary widely, as not all patients will develop symptoms of the disease and are often diagnosed by chance following a blood test for something else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bone pain—often felt in the back, hips, shoulders or ribs—extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle weakness, headaches, extreme thirst and unexplained weight loss are all tell-tale signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blurred vision, dizziness, unexplained bruising, and unusual bleeding such as frequent nosebleeds or heavy periods can also be signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a diagnosis, patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of infection, as their immune system is compromised meaning that an infection can get worse in a matter of hours, increasing the risk of sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood Cancer UK advises anyone who is concerned they may myeloma to contact their GP and inform them of any signs of an infection, such as a fever, flu like symptoms, or a very low temperature below 36°C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Cancer Research UK, there are around 6,200 new myeloma cases in the UK every year, and 3,100 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost 80 per cent of patients will survive their myeloma for five years or more after diagnosis if caught early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At stage three, when the cancer has spread and affects more of the body, the prognosis is much lower, with only 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years after diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:05:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPYVFSdkVsVVg2c1l6SmwzelJIWUlZVXpIbnc3S2JGSlBjSEk2WG5VWElkbmVMeGJta0hHbzNYVGVNc2lZSWI4VWxJd0d4RjRHTUQxa3FmUzY2cEtYTjByTnB2cXFJQUVzX0ZrVld5bTl0azg2WHJVOU5kOGhXY3NrMDFZUzJwYlpQeTRwaU40SWRmdHZtRDFMM2VTUVRsTUtYMTBLbVp6SDlrcF93Vmlr0gG0AUFVX3lxTFBia085QS1BejVDWDBPeXlaaU1Ha3ljUlZlZFFuY3dhWDh4UHpVSVhLd00wcmh5WVpfWW16RjZ1WTZDUXVPeUNISkt3Rmx4YURUX1VpQm83MHBLRm1ocXNfRllsNkpxRnhGdkZyWk5rYUpBa2w3SWM3VWJTWnBNMm51cmRheDR1dDVBOW1nbVNBSlZxQ3VZbzM0clVvSEFnNmxzUHZmQTJFT0ZqVG15M0xMNXV4OA</guid></item><item><title>猪肺移植到人类在主要科学第一- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/pig-lung-transplanted-into-a-human-in-major-scientific-first</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A genetically modified pig lung transplanted into a &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/brain-death"&gt;brain-dead&lt;/a&gt; human patient functioned for nine days in a new achievement that reveals both the promise and significant challenges of xenotransplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the experiment, the patient showed increasing signs of organ rejection before scientists at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China terminated the experiment, allowing the recipient to pass away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first time a pig lung has been transplanted into a human patient, demonstrating a significant step forward, and giving scientists new problems to solve as they develop this emerging medical technique further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-pig-kidney-transplant-was-a-huge-breakthrough-but-is-it-the-future"&gt;&lt;b&gt;World-First Pig Kidney Transplant Was a Huge Breakthrough, But Is It The Future?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of suitable human donor organs presents a major bottleneck for patients in need of a transplant. To help resolve this issue, doctors have been investigating the possibilities presented by xenotransplantation: genetically modifying organs from non-human animals – mainly pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These modified pig organs are not intended to be permanent solutions for the patient, but a stop-gap '&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/TP.0b013e3181ba0555"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;' solution while they wait for a donor organ to become available.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; using pig kidneys and livers have shown promise, although further development and research is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organ presents its own unique complexities and obstacles. A team led by surgeon Jianxing He of Guangzhou Medical University has now tackled the next major challenge: lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the experiment was not to achieve a successful transplantation on the first try – that would have been pretty incredible, but not a realistic expectation. Rather, the researchers wanted to observe how the patient's immune system responded to the transplanted organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172120" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-172120" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea-539x415.jpg 539w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea-600x462.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172120" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers preparing the pig lung for transplantation. (He et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was a 39-year-old man who was declared brain-dead by four separate clinical assessments after undergoing a brain hemorrhage. His family provided written informed consent for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor pig is what is known as a six-gene-edited pig, a Bama miniature pig with six  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73025" data-postid="172116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; gene edits, housed in an isolated facility with rigorous disinfection protocols. These edits are all focused on minimizing the immune and inflammatory responses of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a careful surgical procedure, the pig's left lung was placed into the patient's chest cavity, and connected to their airways, arteries, and veins. The paper does not explain the fate of the pig, but donor pigs do not typically survive the removal of a major organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was also treated with a number of immunosuppressants that the researchers adjusted according to changes observed in the patient's body over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, all seemed well, with none of the immediate signs of hyperacute rejection in the critical few hours following the procedure. However, by 24 hours after the transplant had taken place, severe swelling (edema) was observed, possibly as a result of blood flow being restored to the area of the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibody-mediated rejection damaged the tissue further on days three and six of the experiment. The result of the damage was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MOT.0000000000001065"&gt;primary graft dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, a type of severe lung injury occurring within 72 hours of a transplant, and the leading cause of death in lung transplant patients. Some recovery was taking place by day nine, but the experiment had run its course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pig-liver-successfully-transplanted-into-human-patient-in-world-first"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pig Liver Successfully Transplanted Into Human Patient in World First&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lungs are a very complicated organ to transplant, because they have immediate contact with air from outside the body. This means they need to form an effective line of first defense, acting as a barrier against airborne pathogens and particles. As such, they have multiple mechanisms they can call on for an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to show that they could transplant a pig lung into a human patient in a way that circumvents the dangers of hyperacute rejection, which is an important first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The early onset of pulmonary edema underscores the importance of preventing primary graft dysfunction in future xenogeneic lung transplantation," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03861-x"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continued efforts are needed to optimize immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase.&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03861-x"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By addressing these challenges, future studies can refine the approach to lung xenotransplantation and move closer to clinical translation. This study provides crucial insights into the immune, physiological and genetic barriers that must be overcome, and paves the way for further innovations in the field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03861-x"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Once these symptoms started up again, I went for a blood test and they found I had really elevated prolactin. Doctors said it can mean one of two things – either you're breastfeeding – which I wasn't – or you've got another tumour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After an MRI, Loz was diagnosed with a new tumour on her pituitary gland again, as well as a growth on her pineal gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pineal gland regulates wake and sleep cycles, so the growth there was really contributing to my fatigue.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of severe exhaustion, Loz's immune system faltered, leaving her battling a continuous stream of viruses and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because my sleep was so out of whack with the pineal gland growth, my immune system had become a joke and I seemed to catch one thing after the other.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Loz turned to an integrative medicine doctor she had been working with for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loz was battling crippling fatigue and weight gain, despite a diligent exercise routine and healthy diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being diagnosed with a tumour on her pituitary gland, Loz's sleep suffered and she was unable to have conversations early in the morning or late in the afternoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said, "Look, the main thing is we have to get you feeling less like s***."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He put me on a supplement called NMN. Within a couple of weeks, I felt absolutely amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NMN, or nicotinamide mononucleotide, is a naturally occurring molecule found in all living organisms. It serves as a direct precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a critical coenzyme involved in hundreds of metabolic processes. Think of NAD+ as the body's energy currency, fuelling everything from DNA repair to cellular metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientific community has long been aware of the importance of NAD+, but it's the discovery of NMN's role in the process that has ignited recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Sinclair, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-author of Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don't Have To, found that supplementing with NMN could significantly boost NAD+ levels in mice, effectively reversing age-related blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, says the professor, was a defining moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't just about restoring vision,' he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It proved that ageing is not a one-way street. We turned back the clock in complex tissues without causing cancer, which lent credence to the "Information Theory of Ageing" – the idea that the body ages due to a loss of youthful information, which can be reinstalled, like software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After using a $2 supplement called NMN given to her by an integrative medicine doctor, Loz's energy levels soared&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if we learn to reboot this software safely, ageing may be reversible in humans, too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, how does NMN work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps to think about the process as supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As we age, our NAD+ levels naturally decline, leaving cells with less of the fuel they need to function optimally. When NMN is introduced, the body readily converts it into NAD+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By replenishing NAD+ levels, NMN is believed to support cellular health, potentially slowing some aspects of the ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The implications of this are significant, with ongoing clinical trials exploring its potential benefits in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The explosive popularity of the supplement in recent years has led to a number of different brands hitting the market. Here in Australia, a 120-day supply can cost between $79 and $200, which means you'll pay between 60c and $2 per day. (Over in America, 120-day supplies start at around US$60, or 50c per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loz says her sleep evened out soon after taking the supplement NMN and she was able to throw herself into her work as a public speaker and life coach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before I started taking it, all of my cognition had been compromised by this tumour,' explained Loz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally couldn't have a conversation before ten o'clock in the morning or after four o'clock in the afternoon. It felt as if my brain was stuck buffering, like an old dial-up modem.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm a professional speaker, so you can imagine what it was like getting up on stage and not being able to remember your own freaking speech,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was so debilitating professionally as well as personally.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After NMN, however, the brain fog lifted almost immediately for Loz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Suddenly, my sleep evened out. I could remember everything again. I had so much more energy and it even changed my body composition. My training finally made a difference and even my hairdresser exclaimed, "What are you doing? This is amazing!" My hair had actually outgrown its extensions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Buoyed by her results, Loz began exploring whether or not she could also supplement with NAD+ itself. After all, if the NMN helped replenish NAD+ levels, surely supplementing directly with NAD+ would yield even better results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, as it turns out, is a slightly more complex proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learnt NAD+ can't be taken orally as a supplement,' Loz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She's correct. NAD+ is a delicate molecule, and the process of travelling through a human digestive system means it's essentially destroyed before it's able to be converted into a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research suggests taking NAD+ subcutaneously – as an injection under the skin – makes it more bioavailable for your body to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I began cycling NAD+ boosters subcutaneously,' Loz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The improvements, again, were amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Loz will continue to cycle on and off the NAD+ while consistently taking her NMN supplements to have the maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With the health issues I've had over the years, I've spent $600,000 over two decades just to stay alive – just to stay on this side of the ground, let alone to be thriving,' Loz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I'd only listened to the mainstream advice, I never would have explored the NAD+ or NMN. Now, I don't take medications for anything, and I feel incredible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But creating a weekly meal plan can be a lot of work, and hiring a nutritionist to do it for you can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in many aspects of life these days, some people are turning to AI to craft their meal plans as a bit of a shortcut. And while this might seem like a win-win scenario — it’s fast, it’s free and it’s easy — is using AI for your meal planning actually a good idea? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help parse this out, we reached out to registered dietitians to learn more about the potential perks and drawbacks of AI-generated meal planning, including whether this can be a reliable way to plan your meals in advance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is meal planning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meal planning is when you decide in advance what you’re going to eat each week and draft a weekly menu and grocery list. Meal plans can take many different forms, but they’re often personalized to meet nutritional needs, health goals, dietary preferences and budget constraints. It can be a helpful way to stick to a budget, save time, meet nutritional requirements and consolidate your food shopping into one trip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can create your own meal plan, use an app or hire a professional, such as a registered dietitian. Now, some people are also using AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it actually a good idea to use AI for meal planning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can be a cost-effective and helpful starting point for people who are interested in incorporating meal planning and preparation in their routine, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Patricia Kolesa" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patricia Kolesa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Dish. “It provides a framework and structure for regular meal intake and incorporating certain foods or food groups into the diet that might have not been present before,” Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: carlofranco via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;carlofranco via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Meal plans can help simplify your week, providing you with grocery lists, meal ideas and recipes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But she says AI probably shouldn’t be the only tool you use. Working with a registered dietitian generally allows for a more holistic, targeted, flexible and individualized approach to meal planning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A meal plan is only one piece of the puzzle,” Kolesa said. “When it comes to diet and nutrition, there are other areas like activity levels, stress management and eating behaviors that either further or delay you from meeting your nutrition goals. A meal plan does not take these factors into consideration the way a dietitian or nutrition professional will.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help you better understand the nuances — including the importance of human judgment in meal planning — here are some of the perks and drawbacks of AI-generated meal plans, as explained by registered dietitians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits Of Using AI For Meal Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-based meal planning can be quick, cost-effective, and simple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI makes meal planning way more accessible, including among people who don’t have access to a registered dietitian. “What was once only available through a dietitian or a paid membership program is now available to more people, often for free,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://the-concierge-dietitian.com/home/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Violeta Morris" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://the-concierge-dietitian.com/home/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Violeta Morris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered dietitian at the Concierge Dietitian. This type of practical guidance can help drive meaningful changes in someone’s approach to lifestyle and nutrition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meal plans can help simplify your week, providing you with grocery lists, meal ideas and recipes. “AI can take some of the guesswork out of planning for the week and has the potential to provide new meal ideas,” Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using AI for meal planning is generally a whole lot simpler and quicker than creating your own meal plans and grocery lists and searching for recipes. “Using AI can help make meal planning easier and faster,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.poprecoverysystems.com/melanie-crum" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Melanie Crum," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.poprecoverysystems.com/melanie-crum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Melanie Crum,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a registered dietitian and lead nutritional coach at POP Recovery Systems. “As a dietitian, I like it because it can save time and keep meals healthy and fun.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks Of Using AI For Meal Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the benefits of AI-based meal planning are enticing to many, nutritionists say there are also some potential downsides that are important to understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plans Can Be Generic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-generated meal plans are generally far more generic than what you’ll get when working with a registered dietitian. In some cases, this means you could see a lot of repetition in recommended foods and meals, “which can lead to burnout and stopping your plan entirely,” Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you have a health condition, a generic, AI-generated meal plan might not meet certain nutrient requirements or health goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AI can provide general guidance, but it can’t offer the personalized, clinical recommendations needed — especially for individuals with medical conditions like diabetes or hypertension,” Morris said. “These individuals have specific nutrient targets and require a level of understanding, context and human connection that only a dietitian or healthcare provider can provide.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s A Tricky Learning Curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learning how to properly leverage AI for meal planning, such as understanding what details to include in your prompts, can be challenging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You need to know how to ask the right prompts or it might not give you the best plan,” Crum said. “You have to tell it if you have allergies, foods you don’t like, or how many calories you need. If you don’t give clear info, the plan might not work for you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Can Be Restrictive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An AI-generated meal plan may be too restrictive and promote disordered eating behaviors without the user realizing it, Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Depending on how the user inputs information, the meal plan may remove certain food groups or lack the necessary nutrients to meet daily needs,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you don’t know how many calories your body needs, AI-generated recommendations could amount to more or less than you need. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A dietitian can help figure out how much food and what kind of nutrients you need based on your weight, height, activity level, and health goals,” Crum said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You’ve likely heard about how &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ai-hallucinations-whats-really-happening_l_68556bd5e4b0278e54ed3d14" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="AI can “hallucinate” " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68556bd5e4b0278e54ed3d14" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;AI can “hallucinate” &lt;/a&gt;and offer incorrect information. This can happen with AI meal planning, too. “Due to technical glitches, AI meal plans can overstate quantities or nutrition composition of certain foods as in total number of calories, grams of protein or grams of carbohydrates,” Kolesa said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a medical condition, food restrictions or food allergies and intolerances, it’s important to work with a dietitian for meal planning rather than solely relying on AI. You can include your restrictions and preferences in your prompt, but oversight from a dietitian is important in making sure the plan meets your health needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A dietitian can provide personalized guidance on how to build balanced meals—like getting the right mix of carbs, protein, and fat — and offer the support and accountability that AI tools simply can’t replace,” Morris said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips For Better AI For Meal Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

You're not alone. The study seemingly contradicts a bunch of other research that suggests that meat isn’t so great for you. (For what it's worth, doctors tend to emphasize a plant-forward diet as the healthiest option.) It's also important to note that this study was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA). However, the NCBA was not involved in the study design, data collection and analysis or publication of the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“When you see data like this from a consumer or patient standpoint, it’s really confusing,” admits &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jack-f-jacoub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jack-f-jacoub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack Jacoub, MD" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jack Jacoub, MD&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA.

The researchers didn’t find a higher risk of death in people who ate higher levels of animal protein, and even found a small but notable reduction in how likely the meat-eaters were to die from cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Our data do not support the thesis that source-specific protein intake is associated with greater mortality risk; However, animal protein may be mildly protective for cancer mortality,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's important to note that this was an observational study and cannot outright prove cause and effect here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-animal-protein-associated-with-anti-cancer-benefits" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Why is animal protein associated with anti-cancer benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The reason behind the study's results is not entirely clear. In fact, this is “at odds with many of the higher-quality studies on the subject,” says &lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/kathleen-egan/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/kathleen-egan/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kathleen Egan, ScD" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Kathleen Egan, ScD&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Moffitt Cancer Center. As an example, she points to a 2020 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32699048/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32699048/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="scientific analysis" data-node-id="16.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; of more than 700,000 people that found no link between protein (animal or plant) with death from cancer. (Dr. Jacoub also pointed to that same analysis.) The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society " data-node-id="16.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society &lt;/a&gt;(ACS) also suggests eating a plant-forward diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The category of "animal-based protein" isn’t well-defined in this study, and lumps in things like steak with leaner meats like chicken and fish, Dr. Jacoub notes. “Those have already been linked to a lower prevalence of cancer,” he says. That makes it tricky to tell whether all sources of animal protein may be helpful for cancer risk, or just some. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-plant-protein-provide-the-same-benefits" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Does plant protein provide the same benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's possible. Dr. Egan stresses that the difference between animal and plant proteins’ impact on cancer risk in the study is “very modest” and that animal proteins only had a “marginal” statistical significance. “The weight of evidence suggests there is no meaningful association of dietary protein intake with cancer mortality regardless of protein source,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, Dr. Jacoub says that diet and plant-based diets are a big topic with his cancer patients, and that he tends to give everyone the same advice. “Based on all of the data, one could conclude that you have to limit alcohol, have to try to maintain your body weight through diet and exercise, and that the types of diets that you should be engaging in are probably less focused on red meat and should be focused more on chicken, fish, and vegetables,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-so-special-about-animal-protein-versus-other-types-of-protein" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What’s so special about animal protein versus other types of protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; Animal protein is derived from animal sources like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products, Dr. Egan explains. “It is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that humans need to obtain from their diet for things like muscle repair growth and other bodily functions,” she says. “Plant-based protein is found in foods like legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products. Plant proteins are often complete or may be combined to obtain the full spectrum of amino acids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But again, it’s not clear why eating animal proteins may lead to a lower risk of dying from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-animal-protein-should-i-be-eating-a-week-to-reap-the-benefits" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="24.0"&gt;How much animal protein should I be eating a week to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for total protein is set at 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight a day, Dr. Egan points out. “All available evidence suggests that an emphasis on plant-based protein is optimal for health,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Jacoub stresses that more research is needed, although he recommends leaning more toward animal proteins like chicken and fish over red meat. But, if you really like red meat, he says it’s fine to consume it in moderation. “A little bit of red meat is okay, but the real proven things for lowering cancer risk are high-antioxidant foods like nuts and berries and eating other types of protein,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Rietie Venter, expert in microbiology at the University of South Australia and study lead author, said: 'Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications—particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00144-w"&gt;Antimicrobials and Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists looked at the effects of nine types of medications commonly used in care homes alongside E. Coli drug ciprofloxacin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Venter said: 'When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and acetaminophen, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria's defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E.coli include severe diarrhoea and vomiting, according to the UK Health Security Agency &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that bacterial antimicrobial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27million global deaths in 2019, and contributed to 4.95million deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers expect this trend to continue in the coming decades, with antimicrobial resistance deaths among people over the age of 70 to more than double. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are particularly worried about Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) infections—a rare strain of the diarrhoea causing bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening condition that is becoming increasingly difficult to treat, leading to kidney failure, sepsis and eventually death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-bd3fdb50-8262-11f0-949f-7946aad766ca" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15034579/painkiller-deadly-risk-paracetamol-ibuprofen-study.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT IS ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics have been doled out unnecessarily by GPs and hospital staff for decades, fueling once harmless bacteria to become superbugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned if nothing is done the world is heading for a 'post-antibiotic' era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It claimed common infections, such as chlamydia, will become killers without immediate solutions to the growing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bacteria can become drug resistant when people take incorrect doses of antibiotics or if they are given out unnecessarily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies claimed in 2016 that the threat of antibiotic resistance is as severe as terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures estimate that superbugs will kill 10 million people each year by 2050, with patients succumbing to once harmless bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 700,000 people already die yearly due to drug-resistant infections including tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns have repeatedly been raised that medicine will be taken back to the 'dark ages' if antibiotics are rendered ineffective in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without antibiotics, C-sections, cancer treatments and hip replacements will become incredibly 'risky', it was said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/leading-pediatrics-group-recommends-covid-19-shots-for-young-children-differing-from-cdc-5ed971a6?mod=djemHL_t"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the group would continue to recommend Covid vaccines for kids under the age of 2 — openly defying Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; this May to end the recommendation for both healthy children and pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed suit, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/ob-gyns-clash-with-rfk-jr-to-back-covid-shots-during-pregnancy?cmpid=BBD082525_prognosis&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=250825&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prognosis&amp;amp;embedded-checkout=true"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that it would also continue to advise pregnant people to get a Covid shot. In both cases, some of the country’s leading medical organizations said they wanted to maintain access to protection for the very youngest children, either directly or through vaccinating their mothers, because of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html"&gt;the evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the population is at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19 compared to older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kennedy, in response, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/vaccines/117132?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GBECOygD1fmyU5xIQljpeuRFzwnXDVj9HXevA7-1OZ3RduDJVPYJAsBUX-MnSFw2ZoxRzBkKa_sqK-rIOLJKV87DuxA&amp;amp;_hsmi=377385414&amp;amp;utm_content=377385414&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;ominously warned&lt;/a&gt; the physician groups that their members could lose liability protections from medical malpractice lawsuits if they don’t follow the government’s vaccine guidance. In this new reality in which doctors and federal health officials are at odds over who should get vaccines, shots could be harder to get — and not only Covid shots, but flu vaccines and routine childhood shots, all of which have come under Kennedy’s scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the divide between the Trump administration and other medical authorities may grow even further soon: A group of New England states is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/metro/vaccine-public-health-massachusetts-pennsylvania-rhode-island-vermont-connecticut-maine-kennedy-trump/?event=event12&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosvitals&amp;amp;stream=top"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; this week to discuss whether to issue its own vaccine guidance. Even as scientists develop exciting new applications of the same mRNA technology that helped successfully produce the Covid vaccines as part of &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/18/23560407/operation-warp-speed-pandemics-vaccines-covid-white-house-biden-trump"&gt;Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed”&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, Kennedy is canceling mRNA contracts with drug developers. The loss of federal funding for the platform could possibly close off future treatments before they can even be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a result of all this, more people could get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Drug manufacturers may produce &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/rfk-jr-s-real-impact-on-us-vaccine-supply-to-emerge-as-panel-meets?embedded-checkout=true"&gt;fewer doses&lt;/a&gt; of their existing vaccines. Insurers &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/"&gt;may not be willing&lt;/a&gt; to cover people’s shots if they are not being recommended by the government. Various nightmare scenarios could emerge: Maybe a vulnerable person gives up on getting a shot, even if it is recommended for them and covered by their insurance, simply because they can’t &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; one at a nearby pharmacy. Or maybe the healthy loved one of a vulnerable person won’t be able to afford their shot because their insurance plan won’t cover it anymore. That will leave them to decide between taking the risk to go see their loved one, who could get seriously ill, or not seeing them at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We are running headlong into a forced experiment, in which the federal government actively obstructs the usage of vaccines and the development of new ones, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1056022"&gt;a growing share&lt;/a&gt; of the public has lost their faith in one of modern medicine’s greatest tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-war-between-the-trump-administration-and-the-medical-community-is-heating-up" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The war between the Trump administration and the medical community is heating up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That the federal government and professional medical societies would be openly at war over vaccine guidance in this way really was once unimaginable. Around the turn of the century, more than 90 percent of Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; that childhood immunizations were important. After years of federal advocacy and government coordination with doctors, the United States had successfully &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;eradicated&lt;/a&gt; measles as of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in 2025, less than 70 percent of Americans still &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that childhood vaccinations are “very important.” This year, the US saw &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;its worst measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; since the early 1990s, and Kennedy’s health department was, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/"&gt;based on reporting&lt;/a&gt; by KFF Health News, reluctant to help, while he made public statements &lt;a href="/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response"&gt;waffling&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines — even though the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, for starters, even though anti-vaccine activism has existed for decades, the movement received a boost with the COVID-19 pandemic and the way &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2790248"&gt;it polarized people’s opinions&lt;/a&gt; about public health experts. It edged further into the mainstream with Kennedy’s presidential campaign promising to “Make America Healthy Again” — a movement that has found &lt;a href="/health/421349/trump-rfk-jr-maha-movement-epa-health"&gt;an uneasy home&lt;/a&gt; within the Trump administration. After Trump’s election, he nominated Kennedy to be US health secretary and, once confirmed, Kennedy quickly started rolling back the federal government’s support for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the first few months on the job, he &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/vaccine-opponent-hired-by-rfk-jr-scours-official-records-for-link-to-autism-a1091eb4?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_goqS6BuIyd4jwcvUhO4YmiNe6Tl5q-I3GZjHxmZ74tTJTxdSWDx4fJQ-0zWbnwrluvqD-3IQ0yq-XRLnjILrSLQWbfA&amp;amp;_hsmi=365387600&amp;amp;utm_content=365387600&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;put a vaccine skeptic in charge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning"&gt;searching for a link&lt;/a&gt; between vaccines and autism. He &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;unilaterally rolled back&lt;/a&gt; those COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for kids and pregnant people. He &lt;a href="/health/416304/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-experts-fired"&gt;replaced the federal government’s expert vaccine panel&lt;/a&gt; with his own handpicked members. He has ordered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5445254/cdc-review-vaccine-schedule-children"&gt;a review of the childhood immunization schedule&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9MriQRO5-VQczar56iAzswhoi_Q03T6vIoP7evQOWLBTa4GgAy4ma9HWjzqAHaFwOoDRKi6Tj_A6h84Nlu4wbpS1smYQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=377385414&amp;amp;utm_content=377385414&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;the safety of Covid shots&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; a $500 million mRNA vaccine contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;This is a fight Kennedy wanted.

            &lt;em&gt;Nearly impossible to measure, quantify, convey, pain is a truly mysterious human sensation. For the last 25 years in my life as a neurosurgeon, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering firsthand, so much of it chronic, persistent and difficult to treat. That is why I spent the past three years digging deep into the complexities of pain, its relationship to the brain and strategies to combat it that you have probably never considered. For most of us, pain will be a reality at some point in our lives, but I am more convinced than ever that “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/It-Doesnt-Have-to-Hurt/Sanjay-Gupta/9781668014479" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” which is the title of my new book, releasing on September 2. I am delighted to share a selection below. Then, on September 7, watch CNN at 8 p.m. ET to witness incredible cutting-edge innovations in pain relief in my new documentary, “Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: It Doesn’t Have to Hurt.” - Sanjay&lt;/em&gt;

            When headaches or sore muscles strike us at home, we reach for everyday painkillers. Usually it’s something like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, all analgesics known in the medical world as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). The most common non-NSAID pain reliever is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which isn’t an anti-inflammatory but works well to reduce fever and is typically easier on the stomach. Even before reaching for those over-the-counter meds, we may ice a sore elbow or lower back, or soak in a hot tub to ease achy muscles or joints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the clinical setting, we certainly appreciate it when the dentist numbs our mouth with Novocain. We take anesthesia for granted when rolling into surgery (having had an IV sedative first), or receiving an epidural during childbirth — as my wife did for all three of our girls. Then, of course, there are post-op meds — including, when necessary, prescription opioids to manage acute pain through recovery. In all these ways, we’ve become accustomed to pain relief being an “outside job.” But in truth, elaborate biochemical systems, molecular mechanisms, and mind-body networks for pain control and prevention already exist within us, an “inside job” that science is only beginning to unpack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00033b6q9hyfkewb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mind, body, brain, bones, and blood: every part of us is wired not only for pain but also for pain relief. It’s an incredible system that gets little attention, one I first experienced all those years ago while lying impaled on that spiked fence. Even before I went to the ER or received any medications, I could feel my body starting to soothe itself, my own healing mechanisms taking over. The pain didn’t disappear, but it came in waves, with periods of real relief in between. And then, simply having my mother arrive provided not just mental and emotional comfort but actual physical comfort too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100063b6qmsi8smh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a caring person in your life can improve your resilience to pain, whereas isolation or loneliness can exacerbate it. I remember the first time one of my children got a shot. I didn’t even have to think about what to do: my first instinct was to comfort her with voice and touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen56aif00093b6q5jxwz9ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes when we’re sidelined with a painful injury, a call from a friend or even just listening to music can make a difference in how we feel by flooding the brain’s pain-processing circuitry with positive feelings and emotions. Training your brain in this way is a crucial piece of the healing mix for pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100073b6qqqxkughm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Think of this healing mix as an expanded toolbox that goes beyond what most people consider the “real” tools for pain relief. The conventional conversation tends to focus on medications and medical interventions, but I want to bring your attention to other, less appreciated tools. Let’s start with your body’s built-in painkillers, the endogenous opioid system.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmen57d1h000b3b6qf5148ho5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="your-bodys-natural-painkillers-endogenous-opioids-placebos-and-more" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Your body’s natural painkillers: Endogenous opioids, placebos, and more
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55g9e00003b6qafh0k10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By now you know that opiates are some of the world’s most powerful painkillers. But what you may not know is that your body is adept at producing the natural form of these same chemicals. They’re called endorphins, a term that merges the Greek word &lt;em&gt;endogenous &lt;/em&gt;(meaning “from within”) and &lt;em&gt;morphine&lt;/em&gt;. Though endorphins are just one of several types of protein molecules with this painkiller quality, the word is often used to refer to them collectively. And as you’re about to learn, they can influence your mood as well as your perception of pain. Pump up the endorphins — decrease the pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen581ez000e3b6qpugxgrim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The natural world serves as both an inspiration and a guide as scientists search for ways to tap into or mimic its unique problem-solving genius. A bird in flight, the strength of a spider’s web, a gecko’s sticky grip — all have served as models for scientific inventions. Bioinspired innovations are all around us, from skyscrapers to syringes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000j3b6qq3z6ho15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many years ago, when drug developers began to search for molecules and mechanisms that could safely reduce pain, they drew inspiration from our own human bodies and their endogenous opioid system. Keep in mind that in addition to reducing pain, the system is involved in emotional regulation and mood, neurogenesis (growth of new neurons in the nervous system), neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and the brain’s reward- processing system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000k3b6q7q0z4j35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So how does it work? Opioids, whether endogenous or those found in narcotics (called exogenous opioids), bind to opioid receptors located on the outer membrane of nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. Like molecular keys in locks, when opioids bind to these receptors, they trigger a cascade of chemical changes within and between neurons, producing feelings of pleasure as well as pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000l3b6qjvw54i94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The receptors are also present in the brain’s reward circuitry, which uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to tag experiences of pleasure. That is why we often want to repeat certain experiences. That’s true of all opioids. But endogenous opioids have an insider advantage as a natural part of the body’s interwoven system for pain modulation. Like software programs that are part of the same operating system, they mesh seamlessly. Evolution has fine-tuned their actions with meticulous precision, including the way the body metabolizes them so they can constantly turn on or off, as well as micromanaging doses. This prevents some of the complications that arise with outside opioid medications, including constipation, brain fog, slowed breathing, nausea, and drug tolerance and dependence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000m3b6qptu1mjkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nature even added an emergency survival tool: stress-induced analgesia that temporarily suppresses pain. Under extreme stress, the fight-or-flight hormones aggressively trigger the endogenous opioid system, which greatly reduces the pain. The pain does eventually come back when this emergency hormonal response subsides, but in the meantime, traumatic injuries may not immediately register as painful to a wounded soldier or a kid impaled by a fence. “When you look at the release of norepinephrine and opioids for the flight and fear response — it is one of the most potent analgesic, anti-pain molecules that exists,” says Daniela Salvemini, Ph.D., William Beaumont Professor and director of St. Louis University Institute for Translational Neuroscience. Having devoted her career to understanding the mechanisms that drive neuropathic pain, and the molecules that may relieve it, she remains in awe of “what our bodies have given us as survival kits.” For some, it kicks in right away, and for others, it takes considerably longer, but everyone appears to have this naturally occurring plan B for the most dire circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen595rt000o3b6q0rgjmtm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A variety of stressors, not just physical pain, can trigger the endogenous opioid system. These include psychological, neurological, physiological, even ontological (spiritual or metaphysical) factors, which can activate the system to:
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Because most of these endogenous opioid benefits take place at a subconscious level, these processes have long been assumed to be inaccessible, meaning not something you can control in the same way you can pop a pill. But now we know that simply moving — jogging or going for a brisk walk — can trigger an endorphin release that delivers the rush we call an endorphin high, or “runner’s high.” Gazing at a sunset or a loved one can help do it as well. You can activate your own endogenous opioid system and experience the surprising power of your neural circuits to disrupt pain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;amplify pleasure. We now know that just by choosing to focus on something beautiful or positive, a wondrous cascade of events unfolds in our bodies that can change our experience of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmera7y9m00003b6nkkfboyw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s take a closer look at the term &lt;em&gt;placebo effect&lt;/em&gt;, which many think of as a fake pill or sham treatment used in clinical research to compare effects with the “real” treatment being studied. Researchers typically compare the two, because any health improvements from a new or experimental medication must outperform the placebo by a measurable amount before being deemed worthy of taking forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn00093b6no5mmv7zk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recognizing a placebo’s intrinsic value as something that can improve pain, however, scientists are now investigating the placebo effect on the endogenous opioid system. This makes sense because we know cognitive factors — our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations — can affect our physical and emotional well-being by activating the endogenous opioid system. We also recognize that the effect of any treatment, placebo or “real,” may be affected by the meaning we attach to it, in addition to the physical property of the treatment itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn000a3b6nk25vqtyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two important findings about placebos have become clearer over time. First, there is no single placebo effect; placebo effects are influenced by a multitude of factors at any given time, including expectations (positive or negative) about treatment. Second, these expectations, while intangible, are the product of subjective and physiological experiences that are wired into the brain’s pain-processing circuitry and can be modified over time. This means that far from just being a sham treatment, placebo is a legitimate tool in your pain toolbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawy8z00073b6ncs72aba7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s turn to the external tools. Keep in mind that these can change, or how we use them can change, as scientific understanding evolves. Here’s a simple example that involves a routine home remedy so common and widely accepted, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s been at the center of a simmering debate for nearly fifty years — and counting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000h3b6n1csmi2q4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’ve probably heard of RICE — rest, ice, compression, and elevation — and may have even used it to treat a sprain, strained muscle, or painful bruise. For as long as I can remember, RICE was the recommended first response for treating acute tissue injury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000i3b6nsc4etexe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of RICE dates back to 1978, when a sports medicine physician named Gabe Mirkin coined the term, which coaches and health care providers quickly adopted. At the time, conventional wisdom was that reducing inflammation, along with resting, would reduce pain and hasten healing. Slightly elevating an injury to decrease blood flow and applying gentle pressure presented no red flags medically, so the RICE treatment grew in popularity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000j3b6nnl5079qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whenever I had a mild injury, I used these steps too without ever giving it much thought. Recently, though, amid a flourishing debate, some newer candidates include PEACE (protect, elevate, avoid anti- inflammatories, compress, and educate); LOVE (load, optimism, vascu- larization, and exercise); and POLICE (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation). Without going into all the differences — from vascularization (blood vessel formation) to gauging the proper load for an injured muscle — I’d just point out that the expanding conversation reflects that focus on tweaking health and medical approaches as new scientific findings emerge. What I see as most compelling is a loose but well-reasoned growing consensus that suggests the better option is to replace RICE with MEAT, which stands for movement, exercise, analgesia, and treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000k3b6nlszz9p1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why. The downside of RICE is that it tamps down inflammation.&lt;br&gt;As you’ve read in previous chapters, some level of inflammation is necessary to activate healing processes and reduce the chance of developing chronic pain. While dialing down inflammation may initially ease pain, it also can delay or inhibit long-term tissue healing. The lesson is a critically important one when it comes to pain: let the body take care of itself as naturally as possible. Given what we now know, unless you have a fractured bone or can’t bear weight, RICE should no longer be the blanket recommendation for pain management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraysou000m3b6nxmc9re54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, the emphasis is now on these four steps:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeray2p8000f3b6nd8y1woze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Movement: &lt;/strong&gt;Mild movement or exercise improves blood flow and circula- tion of healing agents to the injured area. It stimulates muscle, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other tissue, whereas stagnation can stall healing and lead to continuing pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraz3bh000p3b6nw1c3m3nh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;This component is meant to kick in once the pain has lessened.&lt;br&gt;For a muscle injury, this would involve gentle moves designed to slowly restore function and flexibility. For other types of bruised or swollen soft tissue, for example, from surgery or trauma, mild exercise further improves circulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazj20000s3b6n9d59rzgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Analgesia: &lt;/strong&gt;Cautious use of pain relievers if necessary, as well as the use of natural options such as turmeric or capsaicin instead of anti-inflammatories, which may inhibit healing for the reasons already described. Also consider topical anesthetics and analgesic patches, or mild transcutaneous neurostimulation such as the TENS device, which applies a low-voltage current to the skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazxfc000v3b6nvxsazm6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; The final component of MEAT refers to the range of tailored early treatment through various therapeutic approaches. These might include physical therapy, massage, acupuncture or other “dry needling” (solid needles containing no medication), myofascial release (and other techniques using targeted massage to release tension in a specific muscle area), joint mobilization (to improve range of motion), as well as use of ice and heat.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0cbj000y3b6nvec3e2si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat and cold therapy both can help relieve pain, though they work in different ways and are best for different situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0skl00113b6nh7oswhic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cold therapy is best for short-term pain, applied within the first seventy-two hours to counter swelling. Keep in mind that while cold temperature slows blood flow, which can help reduce pain from sprains, strains, and other acute injuries, it may also decrease inflammation, slow healing, and increase the likelihood of chronic pain. Regular cold-water plunges have gained a popular following in recent years, and some studies suggest that regular cold exposure through ice bathing or plunges may ease discomfort after intense workouts and help with stress regulation. These may not be the best options, however, for treating an injury. The practice continues to be the subject of debate because it may also carry risks for some people — in particular those with cardiovascular issues. The concern is something known as a cold shock response, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Some may also hyperventilate, which can lead to fainting as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00163b6n0hzkm4dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat therapy is best for long-standing muscle pain, stiffness, and chronic pain conditions. Because it boosts blood flow, which can help relax muscles and ease aching joints, heat therapy is often recommended before exercise or stretching or to ease morning stiffness. Applying low-level heat for a longer period, such as with heat wraps you can buy at the drugstore, may reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. Just be sure to follow product directions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Either way, don’t overdo it. When using a hot or cold pack, wrap it in a thin towel to protect your skin and apply it for no more than ten to twenty minutes to avoid skin damage. You can do this several times a day, but be sure to take breaks in between to let your skin and tissue recover. And stop using heat or cold therapy immediately if it worsens your pain or discomfort or if your skin reacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Neither MEAT nor RICE is all wrong or always right. But with a basic understanding of these points of difference, you’re better equipped to eval- uate your options. The bottom line is that a desire for a quick fix may slow your overall healing process; as a general rule, be conservative with initial interventions like these and pay attention to the way your body responds; let the body heal itself and intervene only when necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Renewed urgency about extended use of aspirin and NSAIDs
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1gjo00143b6nnv7xgd79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s return to your home medicine cabinet and the nonprescription painkillers you probably keep on hand. If your everyday go-to for pain relief is aspirin or another NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), it’s time to take a fresh look at how you use it. We now have not just new information, but continued findings over time, that have renewed urgency about the serious risks NSAIDs present for some people, as well as the adverse effects of taking too much or taking them for too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001i3b6njtzr2xgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs provide predictable relief for so many routine aches and pains — arthritis flare-ups, headaches, fever, menstrual cramps, colds, flu — that it’s easy to lose track of how often you’re using them and how much you’re taking, and overlook their potential for toxic or other adverse effects. And because these drugs are sold over the counter, it often means you’re making a decision about medication without your physician’s guidance on how to avoid potential problems based on health conditions you may have or medications you may be taking. Keep in mind that these nonprescription medications were mostly intended for short-term use, so relying on them long term might put you at risk for complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001j3b6nbtn85whq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspirin is a good example. For decades, aspirin has been used for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is heart disease from plaque buildup in the arteries. In light of recent trial data, however, that practice is now controversial. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness"&gt;risk of bleeding&lt;/a&gt; might simply be too high to justify the benefits of preventing heart disease in someone who’s otherwise healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001k3b6n20nrx3gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That is why in 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that people over sixty years old should not take aspirin to pre- vent primary heart disease. Even for those aged forty to forty-nine who may have a lower bleeding risk, the benefit is still thought to be small. If you’ve already had heart problems or have a strong family history and no evidence of bleeding problems, your doctor may recommend a daily baby aspirin. But in general, many doctors have moved away from the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Supplements: Considerations, caution, and careful use
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3w38001g3b6nut1f07b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are turning increasingly to dietary supplements, seeking out substances they perceive as natural. Unfortunately, because there are very few good, randomized trials, it’s hard to find solid evidence of the benefits of this approach. Additionally, many of these “natural” supplements are unregulated, meaning there’s no guarantee that they’re safe or consistent. There may also be interactions with prescription medications you’re using or other health conditions the supplement could adversely affect. Still, even given the above caveats, I will name a few that are worth considering:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb5l2s001s3b6nu21z5hpa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Coenzyme Q10 or C0Q10. &lt;/strong&gt;There is evidence that this coenzyme can improve mitochondrial function within cells and also act as an anti- inflammatory. Given the way it works, it may be most beneficial when taken after intense activity or with the use of statin drugs — both of which can be associated with muscle aches. It may also effectively lower blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001x3b6np6gr07mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Magnesium. &lt;/strong&gt;Evidence exists that this simple mineral, which is found in all our bones, can help with pain, particularly in the lower back. By blocking calcium from entering cells, magnesium may reduce the excitability of your muscles, allowing them to relax and reduce spasm, especially after exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001y3b6nh9gzhuia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Turmeric. &lt;/strong&gt;Growing up in an Indian household, I’ve been eating turmeric since I was a kid. The active ingredient, curcumin, is thought to be a potent anti-inflammatory, particularly effective for osteoarthritis of the knees. Recently it has been recommended to help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. In recent lab experiments, however, turmeric  inhibited some chemotherapy drugs from working against breast cancer cells and also increased the risk of kidney stones, so make sure to check with your doctor if there is a concern. And buy from a reputable source.&lt;br&gt;Turmeric is among spices that have recently been flagged as potentially being contaminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb7jjs00203b6nbmyxq7nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Willow bark. &lt;/strong&gt;The active ingredient in willow bark is salicin, which is very similar to aspirin. It is broken down into salicylic acid, which helps decrease pain and fever, and like aspirin may have side effects such as upset stomach and bleeding problems. If you’re sensitive to aspirin, have kidney disease, or you’re taking a blood thinner (or planning surgery) check with your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As you consider these or any of the many other options for pain relief we’re about to explore, keep this in mind: pain relief isn’t just about physical relief; it is an integral part of a complex, dynamic healing process that involves every other system in your body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiwuk002d3b6n7dd7wbnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One reason opiates have proven so destructive, especially when used as ongoing treatment for chronic pain, is that over time they corrupt those natural systems. In exchange for initial pain relief, they slowly disable processes essential for normal functioning and healing, and they can create new complications: constipation, nausea, slowed breathing, dizziness, depression, brain fog, and the obvious — dependence and addiction. All of these compromise healing and health, often prolong pain, and carry even greater health risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiv4s002b3b6nsprv5629@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve seen remarkable progress in pain management since the days when opioids and steroids were used to treat most pain maladies. For neuropathic pain, that shooting or burning sensation, we now have drugs such as gabapentin, a prescription medication originally developed as an anticonvulsant, which regulates how pain messages travel from the brain through the spinal cord and reduces the excitability of nerve cells in the brain. “Gaba” (sold under the brand names Horizint, Grayliese, and Neurontin) was approved for treatment of neuropathic pain about twenty years ago, but it is far from a perfect drug. A 2017 review concluded that while around half of those treated had objective pain relief, they also often experienced adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, weight gain, coordination problems, and eye problems. The drug worked best for postherpetic neuralgia; evidence for other types of neuropathic pain was very limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002k3b6n6io6yxwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve also seen an uptick of interest in the use of antidepressants for pain, especially for chronic migraines and long-standing arthritic pain. It’s not entirely clear yet why they help relieve pain for some people. The fact that they increase serotonin, which can improve mood, might be one reason. It may also be that they affect the &lt;em&gt;perception &lt;/em&gt;of pain, reducing the focus the person puts on it and thereby distracting them from it. What is clear is that these medications take a long time to work, sometimes up to several weeks, and even then, the patient may need regular dosage adjustments to minimize side effects. A 2021 systematic meta-review of thirty-three trials showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain with moderate certainty, osteoarthritis pain with low certainty, and sciatica with very low certainty on pain and disability scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002l3b6n0bqp7idc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2023 Cochrane network meta-analysis examining antidepressants across all chronic pain conditions concluded that after investigating twenty- five different antidepressants, “the only antidepressant we are certain about for the treatment of chronic pain is duloxetine. Duloxetine was moderately efficacious across all outcomes at standard dose.” There is also promising evidence for milnacipran, the study said, but higher-quality research is needed. “Evidence for all other antidepressants was low certainty.” Additionally, after randomized controlled trials excluded people with low mood, the review was unable to establish any beneficial effects of antidepressants for people with chronic pain. The review concluded that currently there is “no reliable evidence for the long-term efficacy of any anti-depressant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbl6ig002n3b6n3ju627oc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In people who suffer chronic pain, there’s emerging evidence that their sensory neurons are more excitable than usual and can therefore be more easily triggered. For that reason, there’s new interest in the use of sodium channel blockers, an established tool for quieting seizures, which are also caused by overexcited nerve cells in the brain. Novocaine, which dentists inject into the tissue they want to numb for a procedure, is one example of a sodium channel blocker. The goal has been to turn that into a pill that works for chronic pain conditions, and researchers are currently making progress on that front.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Just this year, the FDA approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/health/fda-approves-painkiller-suzetrigine-journavx"&gt;new drug&lt;/a&gt; in a new class of non-opioid pain medicines, approved to treat moderate to severe acute pain in adults. The approval of Journavx (suzetrigine) marked the first approval of a new class of non-opioid pain relievers in more than two decades. While opioids primarily work by dulling sensations in the brain, the new drug, in fifty milligram oral tablets, is reported to reduce pain by targeting a pain-signaling pathway involving a specific sodium channel in the peripheral nervous system, before the pain signals reach the brain.&lt;br&gt;The efficacy of Journavx was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acute surgical pain, one following abdominoplasty and the other following bunionectomy. In addition to receiving the randomized treatment, all participants in the trials with inadequate pain control were permitted to use ibuprofen as needed as a “rescue” pain medication. Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant superior reduction in pain with Journavx compared to placebo, the FDA said in announcing the approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The discovery of this drug has a fascinating backstory. Nearly twenty-five years ago, researchers learned about a family of fire walkers in Pakistan. They could walk on hot coals without flinching. Importantly, they felt the coals on their feet and even knew they were hot, but it was the specific sensation of pain they weren’t feeling. It wasn’t that their feet were numb, given that the nerves responsible for heat and touch seemed unaffected. Rather it was just the pain-conducting nerves that were affected. That observation led to a quarter-century investigation, the identification of a gene unique to this family, and ultimately helped inspire the development of the new medication.

These provide stronger pain relief than nonprescriptive options, but because they have potential for abuse and unpleasant and potentially serious side effects, they should be reserved for more severe types of pain.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription drugs approved for other conditions&lt;/strong&gt; but repurposed “off-label” for pain. These include antidepressants and anticonvulsants.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulation&lt;/strong&gt;, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), an implanted device that sends low levels of electricity directly into the spinal cord to relieve pain; deep brain stimulation (DBS); and local (external) electrical stimulation, applying brief pulses of electricity to nerve endings under the skin to provide pain relief (Scrambler, TENS).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injection therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, including: &lt;strong&gt;Epidural steroid injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Nerve blocks&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Joint injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Trigger point injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Dry needling&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually as part of a larger pain management plan, dry needling is sometimes recommended. The treatment, which can be initially painful, involves placing thin sharp needles through the skin and into what are known as “trigger points,” areas of muscle that have become knotted and tender. The needling can decrease tightness, improve blood flow, and reduce pain. It’s called “dry” because there are no medications in the needle, as with trigger point injections. &lt;strong&gt;Botox&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Gel injections&lt;/strong&gt; (hyaluronic acid to mimic cushioning fluid in joints): often used for knee pain, especially mild to moderate arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Prolotherapy injections&lt;/strong&gt; (concentrated sugar water to relieve pain in joints, ligaments, and tendons); &lt;strong&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (orthobiologics): a newer category including injectables made from your own blood or tissue, or application of dressings using biomaterials (such as placenta), used to restore tissue in skin grafts and other wound or surgical sites. &lt;strong&gt;Platelet-rich plasma injections and cell therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: PRP injections involve taking the patient’s blood, isolating and concentrating the platelets, and injecting billions of them into the joint, ligament, or tendon. Some newer injectables, called cell therapies, collect cells and tissues from bone marrow or fat tissue. The cells are collected, cleansed, and injected into the patient’s joint, ligament, or tendon.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others&lt;/strong&gt;﻿, including: &lt;strong&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing gas); &lt;strong&gt;Radiofrequency ablation&lt;/strong&gt;, which treats spine pain by using radio waves to heat and destroy nerve tissue, preventing the associated pain signals from reaching the brain. There’s also pulsed electromagnetic wave therapy, a noninvasive FDA-approved treatment that uses magnetic field pulses to improve blood flow to a localized area of pain, such as that from rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/strong&gt; (TMS) is performed by placing a coil on the head to send magnetic pulses that can change the brain’s activity in areas associated with pain. A recent trial showed that the treatment, typically daily sessions for four to six weeks, results in about half of fibromyalgia patients experiencing a meaningful reduction in pain. &lt;strong&gt;Extracorporeal shock wave therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: Think of it as using high-energy sound waves through the skin right on top of the painful area. This type of therapy seems to trigger the body’s natural healing mechanisms, break down scar tissue, and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This can effectively relieve some kinds of pain, primarily that caused by structural issues. Most pain is not caused by structural issues, however, and in those cases, an operation not only won’t resolve the pain, it may even make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

L.A. County also has reported a small increase in patients hospitalized with COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of COVID out there,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UC San Francisco. “COVID is coming a little bit later than last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID lab tests came back positive in &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/" target="_blank"&gt;L.A. County&lt;/a&gt; is 12.6% for the week that ended Aug. 16, up from 7.6% a month earlier. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/respiratoryvirus" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, it’s 14.4%, up from 8.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing outpatient cases increase,” said Dr. Elizabeth E. Hudson, the regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California. “With back-to-school season in full swing ... we are expecting to see an uptick in COVID in children over the next few weeks and this is already being seen in some parts of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/covid-surge-an-emerging-disease-protecting" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post, Dr. Matt Willis, former public health officer for Marin County, wrote that “California’s in the middle of a COVID-19 wave, and statewide rates are among the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; in the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among senior-age residents in Orange County, emergency room visits for COVID-like illness, as well as hospitalizations for COVID, are also on the upswing, said Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, a physician with the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease and Control Division, and Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said the coronavirus subvariant XFG, nicknamed Stratus, accounts for the vast majority of variants seen in wastewater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is another Omicron subvariant, so previous infections with other Omicron variants may offer some residual protection, but, as we know, that protection is not complete, so you can certainly be reinfected,” Hudson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does seem that this summer, COVID season has been less intense than last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In L.A. County, for instance, current COVID hospitalizations for the week that ended Aug. 16 are about half the level seen during the same week last year. And in Orange County, emergency room visits related to COVID-like illness are less than half what they were last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last summer’s COVID surge was the largest since 2022, so this year’s surge is more on par with our less-severe summer surges,” Hudson said. “People are definitely getting COVID this summer, but the intensity is much less than in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in COVID comes as the Trump administration has delayed the rollout of the updated vaccine for the fall. Last year, the federal government had fully green-lighted the annual reformulation of the vaccine by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, in time for a rollout that began in September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, however, the Department of Health and Human Services led by vaccine skeptic Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has in effect delayed the rollout of this fall’s COVID shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Updated COVID-19 vaccines have been delayed this year due to federal policy changes, and we are awaiting [Food and Drug Administration] licensure of this season’s products,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. “This means availability in September may be later than what people experienced last fall.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials noted that the FDA could further revise or limit who can get an annual COVID shot — as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-05-20/trump-officials-set-new-requirements-for-covid-vaccines-in-healthy-adults-and-children"&gt;the agency signaled in May&lt;/a&gt; — “though current evidence continues to show that the vaccines are safe and effective across all ages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health also warned that because the federal government hasn’t made decisions on licensure approvals and recommendations, “availability and timing of specific COVID-19 vaccine products may be more limited and occur on a later schedule.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines, between the slow shutting down of ’24–’25 vaccine availability and access to the ’25–’26 version,” Willis wrote in the Your Local Epidemiologist in California &lt;a class="link" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-171508787" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said that the timing of the vaccine rollout is in such flux and he recommends anyone at risk for severe complications from COVID who hasn’t been vaccinated in more than a year to get inoculated now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at severe risk for COVID illness include those 65 and older, those who have compromised immune systems, those who are pregnant, and all infants and children age 6 months to 23 months. (Children age 2 to 5 are also at greater risk for complications from COVID compared with older children.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they haven’t gotten it in a year, just go ahead, maybe, get it now,” Chin-Hong said. “Because also, the vaccine that’s being proposed [for this fall] is relatively the same formula as last year. ... It’s less important to wait.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might also be easier to get the COVID-19 vaccine now ahead of potential changes in federal recommendations and approvals later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong called the delay in formulating a COVID vaccine game plan for this fall “just weird,” as “usually in public health, preparation is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in previous summers, health officials typically already would be urging people to make plans to get a fall COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this time around, “Nobody knows details about who’s going to be eligible, exactly,” Chin-Hong said, except for those age 65 and up and younger people with chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a whole new discussion, like, ‘When is it coming? Who is it going to be eligible for? ... Do kids have to talk to their pediatrician first? Would pharmacists actually allow them to get it? ... Would healthy pregnant people [be able] to get it?” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s as if officials are talking about a new vaccine and a new illness, but the COVID-19 vaccine has been around for more than four years, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the federal government’s treatment of COVID shots is not happening in a vacuum. Kennedy has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-12/rfk-jr-s-cancellation-of-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;maligned mRNA vaccine&lt;/a&gt; technology — the basis for the most commonly administered COVID shots — and ordered the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-16/dismissed-members-of-cdc-vaccine-committee-call-kennedys-actions-destabilizing"&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; of all 17 experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influential vaccine advisory committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person who will lead a committee to review the safety of COVID vaccines for the CDC has described the shots as “the most failing medical product in the history of medical products,” the New York Times &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccinations &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2836434" target="_blank"&gt;averted&lt;/a&gt; 2.5 million deaths globally from 2020 to 2024, according to a report published in the journal JAMA Health Forum in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine-skeptic leadership of Kennedy over the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and CDC, has prompted such a split in the medical community that mainstream organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics are issuing their own recommendations concerning vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC, for instance, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-31/cdc-radically-changes-its-covid-vaccine-recommendations-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; asked that parents talk with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine for healthy children. That’s an extra step parents may need to take to get their children vaccinated, and could end up being a “super big barrier” for vaccination, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CDC recommended everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccine in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also recently offered “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, by contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that people “receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine or ‘booster’ at any point during pregnancy, when planning to become pregnant, in the postpartum period, or when lactating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 vaccines are particularly effective at reducing morbidity from COVID-19 complications in pregnant patients and their infants,” the organization said. “Data also support the benefit of vaccination in reducing pregnancy complications, such as severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and stillbirth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the American Academy of Pediatrics on &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;Aug. 19&lt;/a&gt; recommended that infants and children age 6 months to 23 months get the updated COVID vaccine, since they “are at high risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also said that children ages 2 and older should be offered the latest COVID vaccine if their parent or guardian wishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The COVID vaccine situation is unsettling. ... Differences in guidance from the CDC and other medical professional groups will be challenging for the public,” the Orange County communicable disease control team said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNRGpRQkNuRm9Ed01oc2VqR3RubUVTSFZ1WXpwWXVGWEE0SGVLZy1ZY1ltLUpBZzUwVnhOcmItS09DajNPbG5zcU1MNkVZekEtVEtyVGNzVGlzXzE4ZVNsclNoTHFVUlliM01PS2MzTURIUkJNb0dqeml4LUZDdjVpTW15MG8xWERZeFBoODlrV1dSSDltMlJrdGEwNE42TW5TY1NORUxtSzI2NHlLUVFyVFBhaGhBb2ZYbnloSlFNZXhMUDdEeXFTUQ</guid></item><item><title>疼痛缓解不仅仅来自药物。Sanjay Gupta博士解释了您身体的天然止痛药- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/health/sanjay-gupta-pain-book-excerpt</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Nearly impossible to measure, quantify, convey, pain is a truly mysterious human sensation. For the last 25 years in my life as a neurosurgeon, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering firsthand, so much of it chronic, persistent and difficult to treat. That is why I spent the past three years digging deep into the complexities of pain, its relationship to the brain and strategies to combat it that you have probably never considered. For most of us, pain will be a reality at some point in our lives, but I am more convinced than ever that “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/It-Doesnt-Have-to-Hurt/Sanjay-Gupta/9781668014479" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” which is the title of my new book, releasing on September 2. I am delighted to share a selection below. Then, on September 7, watch CNN at 8 p.m. ET to witness incredible cutting-edge innovations in pain relief in my new documentary, “Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: It Doesn’t Have to Hurt.” - Sanjay&lt;/em&gt;

            When headaches or sore muscles strike us at home, we reach for everyday painkillers. Usually it’s something like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, all analgesics known in the medical world as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). The most common non-NSAID pain reliever is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which isn’t an anti-inflammatory but works well to reduce fever and is typically easier on the stomach. Even before reaching for those over-the-counter meds, we may ice a sore elbow or lower back, or soak in a hot tub to ease achy muscles or joints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00023b6qs67a57zo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the clinical setting, we certainly appreciate it when the dentist numbs our mouth with Novocain. We take anesthesia for granted when rolling into surgery (having had an IV sedative first), or receiving an epidural during childbirth — as my wife did for all three of our girls. Then, of course, there are post-op meds — including, when necessary, prescription opioids to manage acute pain through recovery. In all these ways, we’ve become accustomed to pain relief being an “outside job.” But in truth, elaborate biochemical systems, molecular mechanisms, and mind-body networks for pain control and prevention already exist within us, an “inside job” that science is only beginning to unpack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00033b6q9hyfkewb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mind, body, brain, bones, and blood: every part of us is wired not only for pain but also for pain relief. It’s an incredible system that gets little attention, one I first experienced all those years ago while lying impaled on that spiked fence. Even before I went to the ER or received any medications, I could feel my body starting to soothe itself, my own healing mechanisms taking over. The pain didn’t disappear, but it came in waves, with periods of real relief in between. And then, simply having my mother arrive provided not just mental and emotional comfort but actual physical comfort too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100063b6qmsi8smh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a caring person in your life can improve your resilience to pain, whereas isolation or loneliness can exacerbate it. I remember the first time one of my children got a shot. I didn’t even have to think about what to do: my first instinct was to comfort her with voice and touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen56aif00093b6q5jxwz9ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes when we’re sidelined with a painful injury, a call from a friend or even just listening to music can make a difference in how we feel by flooding the brain’s pain-processing circuitry with positive feelings and emotions. Training your brain in this way is a crucial piece of the healing mix for pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100073b6qqqxkughm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Think of this healing mix as an expanded toolbox that goes beyond what most people consider the “real” tools for pain relief. The conventional conversation tends to focus on medications and medical interventions, but I want to bring your attention to other, less appreciated tools. Let’s start with your body’s built-in painkillers, the endogenous opioid system.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmen57d1h000b3b6qf5148ho5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="your-bodys-natural-painkillers-endogenous-opioids-placebos-and-more" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Your body’s natural painkillers: Endogenous opioids, placebos, and more
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55g9e00003b6qafh0k10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By now you know that opiates are some of the world’s most powerful painkillers. But what you may not know is that your body is adept at producing the natural form of these same chemicals. They’re called endorphins, a term that merges the Greek word &lt;em&gt;endogenous &lt;/em&gt;(meaning “from within”) and &lt;em&gt;morphine&lt;/em&gt;. Though endorphins are just one of several types of protein molecules with this painkiller quality, the word is often used to refer to them collectively. And as you’re about to learn, they can influence your mood as well as your perception of pain. Pump up the endorphins — decrease the pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen581ez000e3b6qpugxgrim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The natural world serves as both an inspiration and a guide as scientists search for ways to tap into or mimic its unique problem-solving genius. A bird in flight, the strength of a spider’s web, a gecko’s sticky grip — all have served as models for scientific inventions. Bioinspired innovations are all around us, from skyscrapers to syringes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000j3b6qq3z6ho15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many years ago, when drug developers began to search for molecules and mechanisms that could safely reduce pain, they drew inspiration from our own human bodies and their endogenous opioid system. Keep in mind that in addition to reducing pain, the system is involved in emotional regulation and mood, neurogenesis (growth of new neurons in the nervous system), neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and the brain’s reward- processing system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000k3b6q7q0z4j35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So how does it work? Opioids, whether endogenous or those found in narcotics (called exogenous opioids), bind to opioid receptors located on the outer membrane of nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. Like molecular keys in locks, when opioids bind to these receptors, they trigger a cascade of chemical changes within and between neurons, producing feelings of pleasure as well as pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000l3b6qjvw54i94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The receptors are also present in the brain’s reward circuitry, which uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to tag experiences of pleasure. That is why we often want to repeat certain experiences. That’s true of all opioids. But endogenous opioids have an insider advantage as a natural part of the body’s interwoven system for pain modulation. Like software programs that are part of the same operating system, they mesh seamlessly. Evolution has fine-tuned their actions with meticulous precision, including the way the body metabolizes them so they can constantly turn on or off, as well as micromanaging doses. This prevents some of the complications that arise with outside opioid medications, including constipation, brain fog, slowed breathing, nausea, and drug tolerance and dependence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000m3b6qptu1mjkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nature even added an emergency survival tool: stress-induced analgesia that temporarily suppresses pain. Under extreme stress, the fight-or-flight hormones aggressively trigger the endogenous opioid system, which greatly reduces the pain. The pain does eventually come back when this emergency hormonal response subsides, but in the meantime, traumatic injuries may not immediately register as painful to a wounded soldier or a kid impaled by a fence. “When you look at the release of norepinephrine and opioids for the flight and fear response — it is one of the most potent analgesic, anti-pain molecules that exists,” says Daniela Salvemini, Ph.D., William Beaumont Professor and director of St. Louis University Institute for Translational Neuroscience. Having devoted her career to understanding the mechanisms that drive neuropathic pain, and the molecules that may relieve it, she remains in awe of “what our bodies have given us as survival kits.” For some, it kicks in right away, and for others, it takes considerably longer, but everyone appears to have this naturally occurring plan B for the most dire circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen595rt000o3b6q0rgjmtm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A variety of stressors, not just physical pain, can trigger the endogenous opioid system. These include psychological, neurological, physiological, even ontological (spiritual or metaphysical) factors, which can activate the system to:
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Because most of these endogenous opioid benefits take place at a subconscious level, these processes have long been assumed to be inaccessible, meaning not something you can control in the same way you can pop a pill. But now we know that simply moving — jogging or going for a brisk walk — can trigger an endorphin release that delivers the rush we call an endorphin high, or “runner’s high.” Gazing at a sunset or a loved one can help do it as well. You can activate your own endogenous opioid system and experience the surprising power of your neural circuits to disrupt pain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;amplify pleasure. We now know that just by choosing to focus on something beautiful or positive, a wondrous cascade of events unfolds in our bodies that can change our experience of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmera7y9m00003b6nkkfboyw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s take a closer look at the term &lt;em&gt;placebo effect&lt;/em&gt;, which many think of as a fake pill or sham treatment used in clinical research to compare effects with the “real” treatment being studied. Researchers typically compare the two, because any health improvements from a new or experimental medication must outperform the placebo by a measurable amount before being deemed worthy of taking forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn00093b6no5mmv7zk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recognizing a placebo’s intrinsic value as something that can improve pain, however, scientists are now investigating the placebo effect on the endogenous opioid system. This makes sense because we know cognitive factors — our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations — can affect our physical and emotional well-being by activating the endogenous opioid system. We also recognize that the effect of any treatment, placebo or “real,” may be affected by the meaning we attach to it, in addition to the physical property of the treatment itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn000a3b6nk25vqtyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two important findings about placebos have become clearer over time. First, there is no single placebo effect; placebo effects are influenced by a multitude of factors at any given time, including expectations (positive or negative) about treatment. Second, these expectations, while intangible, are the product of subjective and physiological experiences that are wired into the brain’s pain-processing circuitry and can be modified over time. This means that far from just being a sham treatment, placebo is a legitimate tool in your pain toolbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawy8z00073b6ncs72aba7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s turn to the external tools. Keep in mind that these can change, or how we use them can change, as scientific understanding evolves. Here’s a simple example that involves a routine home remedy so common and widely accepted, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s been at the center of a simmering debate for nearly fifty years — and counting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000h3b6n1csmi2q4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’ve probably heard of RICE — rest, ice, compression, and elevation — and may have even used it to treat a sprain, strained muscle, or painful bruise. For as long as I can remember, RICE was the recommended first response for treating acute tissue injury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000i3b6nsc4etexe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of RICE dates back to 1978, when a sports medicine physician named Gabe Mirkin coined the term, which coaches and health care providers quickly adopted. At the time, conventional wisdom was that reducing inflammation, along with resting, would reduce pain and hasten healing. Slightly elevating an injury to decrease blood flow and applying gentle pressure presented no red flags medically, so the RICE treatment grew in popularity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000j3b6nnl5079qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whenever I had a mild injury, I used these steps too without ever giving it much thought. Recently, though, amid a flourishing debate, some newer candidates include PEACE (protect, elevate, avoid anti- inflammatories, compress, and educate); LOVE (load, optimism, vascu- larization, and exercise); and POLICE (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation). Without going into all the differences — from vascularization (blood vessel formation) to gauging the proper load for an injured muscle — I’d just point out that the expanding conversation reflects that focus on tweaking health and medical approaches as new scientific findings emerge. What I see as most compelling is a loose but well-reasoned growing consensus that suggests the better option is to replace RICE with MEAT, which stands for movement, exercise, analgesia, and treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000k3b6nlszz9p1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why. The downside of RICE is that it tamps down inflammation.&lt;br&gt;As you’ve read in previous chapters, some level of inflammation is necessary to activate healing processes and reduce the chance of developing chronic pain. While dialing down inflammation may initially ease pain, it also can delay or inhibit long-term tissue healing. The lesson is a critically important one when it comes to pain: let the body take care of itself as naturally as possible. Given what we now know, unless you have a fractured bone or can’t bear weight, RICE should no longer be the blanket recommendation for pain management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraysou000m3b6nxmc9re54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, the emphasis is now on these four steps:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeray2p8000f3b6nd8y1woze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Movement: &lt;/strong&gt;Mild movement or exercise improves blood flow and circula- tion of healing agents to the injured area. It stimulates muscle, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other tissue, whereas stagnation can stall healing and lead to continuing pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraz3bh000p3b6nw1c3m3nh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;This component is meant to kick in once the pain has lessened.&lt;br&gt;For a muscle injury, this would involve gentle moves designed to slowly restore function and flexibility. For other types of bruised or swollen soft tissue, for example, from surgery or trauma, mild exercise further improves circulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazj20000s3b6n9d59rzgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Analgesia: &lt;/strong&gt;Cautious use of pain relievers if necessary, as well as the use of natural options such as turmeric or capsaicin instead of anti-inflammatories, which may inhibit healing for the reasons already described. Also consider topical anesthetics and analgesic patches, or mild transcutaneous neurostimulation such as the TENS device, which applies a low-voltage current to the skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazxfc000v3b6nvxsazm6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; The final component of MEAT refers to the range of tailored early treatment through various therapeutic approaches. These might include physical therapy, massage, acupuncture or other “dry needling” (solid needles containing no medication), myofascial release (and other techniques using targeted massage to release tension in a specific muscle area), joint mobilization (to improve range of motion), as well as use of ice and heat.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0cbj000y3b6nvec3e2si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat and cold therapy both can help relieve pain, though they work in different ways and are best for different situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0skl00113b6nh7oswhic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cold therapy is best for short-term pain, applied within the first seventy-two hours to counter swelling. Keep in mind that while cold temperature slows blood flow, which can help reduce pain from sprains, strains, and other acute injuries, it may also decrease inflammation, slow healing, and increase the likelihood of chronic pain. Regular cold-water plunges have gained a popular following in recent years, and some studies suggest that regular cold exposure through ice bathing or plunges may ease discomfort after intense workouts and help with stress regulation. These may not be the best options, however, for treating an injury. The practice continues to be the subject of debate because it may also carry risks for some people — in particular those with cardiovascular issues. The concern is something known as a cold shock response, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Some may also hyperventilate, which can lead to fainting as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00163b6n0hzkm4dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat therapy is best for long-standing muscle pain, stiffness, and chronic pain conditions. Because it boosts blood flow, which can help relax muscles and ease aching joints, heat therapy is often recommended before exercise or stretching or to ease morning stiffness. Applying low-level heat for a longer period, such as with heat wraps you can buy at the drugstore, may reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. Just be sure to follow product directions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00173b6num9cm5z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, don’t overdo it. When using a hot or cold pack, wrap it in a thin towel to protect your skin and apply it for no more than ten to twenty minutes to avoid skin damage. You can do this several times a day, but be sure to take breaks in between to let your skin and tissue recover. And stop using heat or cold therapy immediately if it worsens your pain or discomfort or if your skin reacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00183b6ns8ydt47l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Neither MEAT nor RICE is all wrong or always right. But with a basic understanding of these points of difference, you’re better equipped to eval- uate your options. The bottom line is that a desire for a quick fix may slow your overall healing process; as a general rule, be conservative with initial interventions like these and pay attention to the way your body responds; let the body heal itself and intervene only when necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Renewed urgency about extended use of aspirin and NSAIDs
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1gjo00143b6nnv7xgd79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s return to your home medicine cabinet and the nonprescription painkillers you probably keep on hand. If your everyday go-to for pain relief is aspirin or another NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), it’s time to take a fresh look at how you use it. We now have not just new information, but continued findings over time, that have renewed urgency about the serious risks NSAIDs present for some people, as well as the adverse effects of taking too much or taking them for too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001i3b6njtzr2xgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs provide predictable relief for so many routine aches and pains — arthritis flare-ups, headaches, fever, menstrual cramps, colds, flu — that it’s easy to lose track of how often you’re using them and how much you’re taking, and overlook their potential for toxic or other adverse effects. And because these drugs are sold over the counter, it often means you’re making a decision about medication without your physician’s guidance on how to avoid potential problems based on health conditions you may have or medications you may be taking. Keep in mind that these nonprescription medications were mostly intended for short-term use, so relying on them long term might put you at risk for complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001j3b6nbtn85whq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspirin is a good example. For decades, aspirin has been used for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is heart disease from plaque buildup in the arteries. In light of recent trial data, however, that practice is now controversial. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness"&gt;risk of bleeding&lt;/a&gt; might simply be too high to justify the benefits of preventing heart disease in someone who’s otherwise healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001k3b6n20nrx3gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That is why in 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that people over sixty years old should not take aspirin to pre- vent primary heart disease. Even for those aged forty to forty-nine who may have a lower bleeding risk, the benefit is still thought to be small. If you’ve already had heart problems or have a strong family history and no evidence of bleeding problems, your doctor may recommend a daily baby aspirin. But in general, many doctors have moved away from the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h4" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmerb4p9z001p3b6nk3d52xiu@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="supplements-considerations-caution-and-careful-use" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Supplements: Considerations, caution, and careful use
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3w38001g3b6nut1f07b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are turning increasingly to dietary supplements, seeking out substances they perceive as natural. Unfortunately, because there are very few good, randomized trials, it’s hard to find solid evidence of the benefits of this approach. Additionally, many of these “natural” supplements are unregulated, meaning there’s no guarantee that they’re safe or consistent. There may also be interactions with prescription medications you’re using or other health conditions the supplement could adversely affect. Still, even given the above caveats, I will name a few that are worth considering:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb5l2s001s3b6nu21z5hpa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Coenzyme Q10 or C0Q10. &lt;/strong&gt;There is evidence that this coenzyme can improve mitochondrial function within cells and also act as an anti- inflammatory. Given the way it works, it may be most beneficial when taken after intense activity or with the use of statin drugs — both of which can be associated with muscle aches. It may also effectively lower blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001x3b6np6gr07mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Magnesium. &lt;/strong&gt;Evidence exists that this simple mineral, which is found in all our bones, can help with pain, particularly in the lower back. By blocking calcium from entering cells, magnesium may reduce the excitability of your muscles, allowing them to relax and reduce spasm, especially after exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001y3b6nh9gzhuia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Turmeric. &lt;/strong&gt;Growing up in an Indian household, I’ve been eating turmeric since I was a kid. The active ingredient, curcumin, is thought to be a potent anti-inflammatory, particularly effective for osteoarthritis of the knees. Recently it has been recommended to help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. In recent lab experiments, however, turmeric  inhibited some chemotherapy drugs from working against breast cancer cells and also increased the risk of kidney stones, so make sure to check with your doctor if there is a concern. And buy from a reputable source.&lt;br&gt;Turmeric is among spices that have recently been flagged as potentially being contaminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb7jjs00203b6nbmyxq7nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Willow bark. &lt;/strong&gt;The active ingredient in willow bark is salicin, which is very similar to aspirin. It is broken down into salicylic acid, which helps decrease pain and fever, and like aspirin may have side effects such as upset stomach and bleeding problems. If you’re sensitive to aspirin, have kidney disease, or you’re taking a blood thinner (or planning surgery) check with your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As you consider these or any of the many other options for pain relief we’re about to explore, keep this in mind: pain relief isn’t just about physical relief; it is an integral part of a complex, dynamic healing process that involves every other system in your body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiwuk002d3b6n7dd7wbnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One reason opiates have proven so destructive, especially when used as ongoing treatment for chronic pain, is that over time they corrupt those natural systems. In exchange for initial pain relief, they slowly disable processes essential for normal functioning and healing, and they can create new complications: constipation, nausea, slowed breathing, dizziness, depression, brain fog, and the obvious — dependence and addiction. All of these compromise healing and health, often prolong pain, and carry even greater health risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiv4s002b3b6nsprv5629@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve seen remarkable progress in pain management since the days when opioids and steroids were used to treat most pain maladies. For neuropathic pain, that shooting or burning sensation, we now have drugs such as gabapentin, a prescription medication originally developed as an anticonvulsant, which regulates how pain messages travel from the brain through the spinal cord and reduces the excitability of nerve cells in the brain. “Gaba” (sold under the brand names Horizint, Grayliese, and Neurontin) was approved for treatment of neuropathic pain about twenty years ago, but it is far from a perfect drug. A 2017 review concluded that while around half of those treated had objective pain relief, they also often experienced adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, weight gain, coordination problems, and eye problems. The drug worked best for postherpetic neuralgia; evidence for other types of neuropathic pain was very limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002k3b6n6io6yxwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve also seen an uptick of interest in the use of antidepressants for pain, especially for chronic migraines and long-standing arthritic pain. It’s not entirely clear yet why they help relieve pain for some people. The fact that they increase serotonin, which can improve mood, might be one reason. It may also be that they affect the &lt;em&gt;perception &lt;/em&gt;of pain, reducing the focus the person puts on it and thereby distracting them from it. What is clear is that these medications take a long time to work, sometimes up to several weeks, and even then, the patient may need regular dosage adjustments to minimize side effects. A 2021 systematic meta-review of thirty-three trials showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain with moderate certainty, osteoarthritis pain with low certainty, and sciatica with very low certainty on pain and disability scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A 2023 Cochrane network meta-analysis examining antidepressants across all chronic pain conditions concluded that after investigating twenty- five different antidepressants, “the only antidepressant we are certain about for the treatment of chronic pain is duloxetine. Duloxetine was moderately efficacious across all outcomes at standard dose.” There is also promising evidence for milnacipran, the study said, but higher-quality research is needed. “Evidence for all other antidepressants was low certainty.” Additionally, after randomized controlled trials excluded people with low mood, the review was unable to establish any beneficial effects of antidepressants for people with chronic pain. The review concluded that currently there is “no reliable evidence for the long-term efficacy of any anti-depressant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In people who suffer chronic pain, there’s emerging evidence that their sensory neurons are more excitable than usual and can therefore be more easily triggered. For that reason, there’s new interest in the use of sodium channel blockers, an established tool for quieting seizures, which are also caused by overexcited nerve cells in the brain. Novocaine, which dentists inject into the tissue they want to numb for a procedure, is one example of a sodium channel blocker. The goal has been to turn that into a pill that works for chronic pain conditions, and researchers are currently making progress on that front.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Just this year, the FDA approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/health/fda-approves-painkiller-suzetrigine-journavx"&gt;new drug&lt;/a&gt; in a new class of non-opioid pain medicines, approved to treat moderate to severe acute pain in adults. The approval of Journavx (suzetrigine) marked the first approval of a new class of non-opioid pain relievers in more than two decades. While opioids primarily work by dulling sensations in the brain, the new drug, in fifty milligram oral tablets, is reported to reduce pain by targeting a pain-signaling pathway involving a specific sodium channel in the peripheral nervous system, before the pain signals reach the brain.&lt;br&gt;The efficacy of Journavx was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acute surgical pain, one following abdominoplasty and the other following bunionectomy. In addition to receiving the randomized treatment, all participants in the trials with inadequate pain control were permitted to use ibuprofen as needed as a “rescue” pain medication. Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant superior reduction in pain with Journavx compared to placebo, the FDA said in announcing the approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The discovery of this drug has a fascinating backstory. Nearly twenty-five years ago, researchers learned about a family of fire walkers in Pakistan. They could walk on hot coals without flinching. Importantly, they felt the coals on their feet and even knew they were hot, but it was the specific sensation of pain they weren’t feeling. It wasn’t that their feet were numb, given that the nerves responsible for heat and touch seemed unaffected. Rather it was just the pain-conducting nerves that were affected. That observation led to a quarter-century investigation, the identification of a gene unique to this family, and ultimately helped inspire the development of the new medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

             Following are some of the many available options for pain relief and management:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="factbox__title inline-placeholder" data-editable="title"&gt;
    
  &lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;ul data-editable="items" class="factbox__items factbox__items--ul"&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription pain medicines&lt;/strong&gt;, including opioids﻿. These provide stronger pain relief than nonprescriptive options, but because they have potential for abuse and unpleasant and potentially serious side effects, they should be reserved for more severe types of pain.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription drugs approved for other conditions&lt;/strong&gt; but repurposed “off-label” for pain. These include antidepressants and anticonvulsants.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulation&lt;/strong&gt;, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), an implanted device that sends low levels of electricity directly into the spinal cord to relieve pain; deep brain stimulation (DBS); and local (external) electrical stimulation, applying brief pulses of electricity to nerve endings under the skin to provide pain relief (Scrambler, TENS).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injection therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, including: &lt;strong&gt;Epidural steroid injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Nerve blocks&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Joint injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Trigger point injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Dry needling&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually as part of a larger pain management plan, dry needling is sometimes recommended. The treatment, which can be initially painful, involves placing thin sharp needles through the skin and into what are known as “trigger points,” areas of muscle that have become knotted and tender. The needling can decrease tightness, improve blood flow, and reduce pain. It’s called “dry” because there are no medications in the needle, as with trigger point injections. &lt;strong&gt;Botox&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Gel injections&lt;/strong&gt; (hyaluronic acid to mimic cushioning fluid in joints): often used for knee pain, especially mild to moderate arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Prolotherapy injections&lt;/strong&gt; (concentrated sugar water to relieve pain in joints, ligaments, and tendons); &lt;strong&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (orthobiologics): a newer category including injectables made from your own blood or tissue, or application of dressings using biomaterials (such as placenta), used to restore tissue in skin grafts and other wound or surgical sites. &lt;strong&gt;Platelet-rich plasma injections and cell therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: PRP injections involve taking the patient’s blood, isolating and concentrating the platelets, and injecting billions of them into the joint, ligament, or tendon. Some newer injectables, called cell therapies, collect cells and tissues from bone marrow or fat tissue. The cells are collected, cleansed, and injected into the patient’s joint, ligament, or tendon.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others&lt;/strong&gt;﻿, including: &lt;strong&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing gas); &lt;strong&gt;Radiofrequency ablation&lt;/strong&gt;, which treats spine pain by using radio waves to heat and destroy nerve tissue, preventing the associated pain signals from reaching the brain. There’s also pulsed electromagnetic wave therapy, a noninvasive FDA-approved treatment that uses magnetic field pulses to improve blood flow to a localized area of pain, such as that from rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/strong&gt; (TMS) is performed by placing a coil on the head to send magnetic pulses that can change the brain’s activity in areas associated with pain. A recent trial showed that the treatment, typically daily sessions for four to six weeks, results in about half of fibromyalgia patients experiencing a meaningful reduction in pain. &lt;strong&gt;Extracorporeal shock wave therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: Think of it as using high-energy sound waves through the skin right on top of the painful area. This type of therapy seems to trigger the body’s natural healing mechanisms, break down scar tissue, and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This can effectively relieve some kinds of pain, primarily that caused by structural issues. Most pain is not caused by structural issues, however, and in those cases, an operation not only won’t resolve the pain, it may even make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That’s usually caused by an infection, but her tests came back normal. High dose steroids, a standard treatment, weren’t effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;By that point, the girl’s brain was so swollen physicians had to remove part of her skull to relieve the pressure, which had put her at risk of brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;She was “critically ill,” recalled Whitney Reid, an immunologist and one of her doctors at CHOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Frustrated and lacking answers, her doctors sequenced her DNA. They found she had an ultra-rare genetic disorder in which the immune system becomes dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The disorder, complement factor I deficiency, is caused by mutations in a gene that would normally regulate part of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;It can cause harmful inflammation, particularly in the brain and spinal cord. That can present as a fever, nausea, confusion, dizziness, and even numbness. The condition also leads to recurrent bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Complement factor I deficiency is so rare it affects fewer than one in a million people born worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The discovery spurred the Clinic for Special Children, an independent clinic in Lancaster County dedicated to treating patients with rare genetic disorders, to test several more Amish patients for the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Soon, physicians had identified a cluster of cases, leading doctors at CHOP and the Clinic to another surprising finding: Among the Old Order Amish, the largest group of Amish people, the disorder is estimated to affect as many as 1 in 730 people. That’s because mutations causing the disorder are more than 4,500 times more common in this group than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;This statistic, &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674925006980" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674925006980"&gt;reported in a new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, led doctors to revisit past instances of brain inflammation in Amish patients, and ultimately solve a yearslong medical mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;An undiagnosed mystery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Amish patients had been showing up at the Clinic for Special Children and nearby hospitals with brain inflammation for years. Doctors couldn’t figure out what was causing it. They would simply treat the patients and send them home once the symptoms resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Many likely had complement factor I deficiency, but were undiagnosed, said Vincent Carson, a pediatric neurologist at the Clinic and co-senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“Nobody was looking for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;After&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;CHOP diagnosed the Amish girl in 2021 with the disorder, doctors began to test symptomatic Amish patients&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the disorder. Carson&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;even sent messages out to colleagues around the country alerting them to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“When they identified this in the first patient, that then made us look at anybody from the Amish community through a different lens,” Carson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;This isn’t the first genetic disorder to be overrepresented in the Amish community. The Clinic was specifically founded in 1989 in response to higher rates of rare genetic diseases in Amish and Mennonite people. Some of the most notable are a type of dwarfism called Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and assorted metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The reason for this comes down to a phenomenon called the “founder effect,” which happens when a small number of individuals isolate from the larger population. Over generations, this leads to less&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;genetic diversity, with the genes of the “founders” becoming disproportionately present in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;It’s kind of like if you took a crayon pack, picked just a few colors, and threw the rest away. All your drawings will be some combination of those colors from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Most of the approximately &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/population-2024/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/population-2024/"&gt;400,000 Amish people&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in America&lt;/a&gt; descend from just a few hundred settlers who immigrated to the United States in the 18th century. Any errors in the genetic code of those original members were more likely to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That includes the genetic mutation that causes complement factor I deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;A dysfunctional immune system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The disorder affects&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a group of proteins in the immune system that help clear bacteria and viruses from the body. Known as “the complement system,” it helps fight infection, but should only be turned on when there’s an active threat. Otherwise, it could cause damage to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;People with the disorder lack a protein called “complement factor I,” which normally turns the system off when it’s not needed. This results in the complement system running wild, like a car without a brake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“If a patient is missing that protein, they could be predisposed to having that part of the immune system attack their own bodies,” said Reid, who was first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Amish families would often share stories of kids being more sick than their siblings, and having a history of pneumonia, ear infections, and even infections that turned fatal, Carson said. Those were likely undiagnosed cases of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Reid and Carson recently held a family education day at the Clinic for the Amish community to learn more about complement factor I deficiency. They emphasized the importance of couples with a family history doing genetic testing to see if they have the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Knowing you have the disease could help families watch out for potentially dangerous symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;For example, doctors can give families an emergency plan if their child has a fever, including antibiotics to use at home. Additional vaccines could be given to help prevent dangerous infections caused by pneumococcal and meningococcal bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;They could also warn parents to seek care quickly if a child has a bad headache or is more tired than usual, because that could indicate inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;For unknown reasons, this symptom seems to occur mostly in females, starting in their teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The Amish girl at CHOP was only 17 when brain inflammation landed her in the intensive care unit. In addition to getting skull surgery and steroids, she received therapeutic cooling and blood plasma exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At first, these treatments seemed to work, but then her symptoms returned, including a fever, vomiting, altered mental status, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Once doctors found out she had complement factor I deficiency, that helped them find the right medicine to treat her. They chose a drug called eculizumab, which inhibits the complement system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Within a day or two, she recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“She is perfectly fine, and is a schoolteacher living her life very happily,” said Reid, who saw her a few weeks ago along with Carson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“You wouldn’t even know that she went through such an ordeal,” Carson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Inquirer.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 09:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNbHhyd28tSFktMi1KZVR2SXdQT2llV3dmblRLXzlnVXowajNCTC03RlgtTS14ZVAxc24wR0dpWVRHeURCYVVLXzJVNk5SM2xaSGFfeTc1ampERk5Pem50LXN1SWh6alVTYjk0WjRmWTZvdzcyYkZmbFFJZW1PSXR0Njh5cm5LRFQyeDZncTFYSkIxU2RSVUtLcEJheDNlUmVJYTRyLWZBUS1QR0kxOE8wekZrQU9PVDl4MU93eU53</guid></item><item><title>担心微塑料？以下是如何从水中去除高达90 ％的微塑料-食品和葡萄酒</title><link>https://www.foodandwine.com/boiling-water-removes-microplastics-study-11796372</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we become more aware of where microplastics are and the effects they can have on human health, we're also learning about how we can reduce our exposure to them. And according to new research, when it comes to our drinking water, that may be easier than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In early 2024, researchers from Guangzhou Medical University and Jinan University in China published the findings of a study on eliminating microplastics from tap water in the peer-reviewed scientific journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt;, and the solution might come down to one simple step: boiling water. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To analyze the effects of boiling water that contains microplastics, the team spiked tap water with three common plastics: polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene. The researchers observed that when the water hit a roiling boil, naturally occurring minerals like calcium carbonate began forming solid crystals. Those crystals surrounded and trapped the plastic particles in the water before settling at the bottom of the liquid. Scientists then allowed the water to cool and separated out the deposits of minerals and microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to their findings, boiling and filtering out these crystals can remove up to 90% of the nano- and microplastic particles (NMPs) present. However, it's critical to note that the water needed to have a high mineral content — defined as "hard water" — for the boiling to prove this effective. In soft water with a lower mineral content, the team saw reductions of around 25% of microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This simple boiling-water strategy can 'decontaminate' NMPs from household tap water and has the potential for harmlessly alleviating human intake of NMPs through water consumption," the authors explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because the mineral content and amount of microplastics in tap water can vary so greatly around the world, researchers approximated that the amount of microplastics ingested on a daily basis from boiled water could range between two to five times less than that of regular tap water, depending on where the water is sourced from.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These results present a promising and affordable way to reduce microplastic exposure around the world. Although more research with a greater sample size is needed, scientists pointed out that, "our results have ratified a highly feasible strategy to reduce human NMP exposure and established the foundation for further investigations..."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're worried about exposure to microplastics through food and drink, there are a few other simple steps you can take to diminish the presence of these particles in your kitchen, including swapping out plastic cutting boards for &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/best-wooden-cutting-boards-8628824" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wooden cutting boards&lt;/a&gt; or replacing plastic utensils with materials like metal, wood, and silicone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another easy substitution? Check the material makeup of your cleaning rags. As Lisa Erdle, PhD — a biologist, ecotoxicologist, and the director of science and innovation at the &lt;a href="https://www.5gyres.org/team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;5 Gyres Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit focused on reducing plastic pollution — previously advised, “opting for &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/how-to-reduce-microplastics-in-the-kitchen-11760233" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;home textiles&lt;/a&gt; made from natural fibers [like cotton] instead of synthetic” is an easy way to lessen the spread of microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we await more research on the impact of microplastics and how to avoid them, at least existing information shows that many of us can easily implement a few strategies to decrease the presence of these particles at home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to reduce your exposure without putting in a ton of work? Here are a few simple swaps to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace nonstick pans: &lt;/strong&gt;While artificially nonstick pans may be easier to clean, they're often coated in polytetrafluoroethylene, a plastic coating that degrades and releases particles into your food over time. Instead, you can opt for materials like cast iron, stainless steel, carbon steel, and some ceramic skillets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap single-use plastic storage:&lt;/strong&gt; Invest in glass or stainless steel storage containers and ditch those single-use plastic storage bags for your leftovers. This will reduce your exposure to microplastics and save you money in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid takeout containers:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever possible, avoid plastic takeout containers, which not only shed microplastics but may also leach chemicals that could be harmful to your &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/plastic-food-containers-heart-failure-study-11684440" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3 clinical trial results from Scripps Research and its collaborators supported FDA approval of ENCELTO, the first cell-based treatment for the neurodegenerative retinal disease known as MacTel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individuals with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), a rare retinal disease that steadily erodes central vision, no approved therapies had previously existed. Now, a study led by investigators at Scripps Research and the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;National Institutes of Health&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. Founded in 1887, it is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program. With 27 different institutes and centers under its umbrella, the NIH covers a broad spectrum of health-related research, including specific diseases, population health, clinical research, and fundamental biological processes. Its mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; (NIH), and sponsored by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, provides strong evidence that a neuroprotective surgical implant can slow the progression of vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a step toward redefining how we think about vision loss,” says Professor Martin Friedlander of Scripps Research, one of the study’s corresponding authors. “Instead of waiting for cells to die, we’re learning how to protect and preserve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Evidence&lt;/em&gt; on July 22, 2025, presents findings from two phase 3 clinical trials of ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), an implanted device that steadily releases a therapeutic protein to help maintain vision. The trials, conducted over 24 months at 47 sites worldwide, enrolled 228 people with MacTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinated through a global collaboration of clinicians and scientists, with contributions from the NIH’s National Eye Institute, the Lowy Medical Research Institute, and Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, the trials provided the critical data that supported the US Food and Drug Administration’s March 2025 approval of ENCELTO. This decision marked the first approved therapy for MacTel and the first cell-based neuroprotective treatment for any neurodegenerative retinal or central nervous system disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Consistent preservation of vision across trials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two trials were designed in the same way but involved participants recruited at different times and locations. Both demonstrated that ENCELTO slowed the decline of light-sensing retinal cells, though one trial showed a stronger effect, likely reflecting differences in disease severity and other variables among participants. Taken together, the findings strongly support the implant’s ability to help preserve vision in individuals with MacTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve seen a therapy meaningfully alter the course of MacTel,” says Friedlander. “It confirms that neuroprotection can be a powerful strategy to preserve vision in degenerative retinal conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490839" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490839" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-673x1200.jpg" alt="Healthy Retina and MacTel Affected Retina Images" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-673x1200.jpg 673w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-337x600.jpg 337w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-768x1369.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-150x267.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-450x802.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images.jpg 777w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490839" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Images of a healthy retina (top) and a retina affected by macular telangiectasia type 2 (bottom). Credit: Scripps Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedlander, who also serves as president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, has studied MacTel for nearly 20 years and helped build the scientific foundation for ENCELTO. The implant delivers ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a natural protein known to protect retinal neurons. It consists of genetically engineered retinal pigment epithelial cells, which provide essential support to the retina, enclosed in a small collagen-based capsule implanted at the back of the eye. This capsule shields the cells from immune attack while allowing them to release CNTF continuously, enabling long-term, localized treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Significant reduction in photoreceptor loss&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research showed that ENCELTO substantially slowed the degeneration of photoreceptors—light-detecting nerve cells essential for central vision—compared with sham-treated eyes that underwent a simulated surgery without receiving the implant. In one trial, the implant reduced the rate of ellipsoid zone loss, a marker of photoreceptor damage, by 54.8%. The second trial demonstrated a 30.6% reduction, smaller in magnitude but still statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond structural changes, the study assessed multiple measures of visual function, including microperimetry (a sensitive test of retinal light response) and reading speed. Microperimetry results indicated a clear slowing of functional decline, especially in the trial that showed stronger photoreceptor preservation. However, outcomes for reading speed and retinal sensitivity were mixed, with one trial showing improvement while the other found no significant difference compared with controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These differences highlight just how complex it is to measure functional vision loss in a slow-progressing disease like MacTel,” points out Friedlander. “If you look at certain functional outcomes from just one of the trials, they’re not statistically significant. But when you pool data from both trials—which were conducted the same way—then you see statistically significant results, so we’ll continue to investigate what’s driving that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits with early intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the variability, the overall trend across both trials supports ENCELTO’s long-term benefit, particularly when treatment is initiated before extensive cell loss. Participants tolerated the implant well, with minimal side effects. Furthermore, ENCELTO was effective regardless of the participant’s baseline vision or disease stage, suggesting that earlier intervention may help preserve more functional vision as MacTel progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Friedlander and his team will assess whether benefits continue or even improve beyond 24 months. There are also plans to explore why some individuals experienced greater gains than others, which may help identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The consistency in preserving retinal cells across both trials gives us confidence in the mechanism,” says Friedlander. “As we refine how and when to treat MacTel, we expect even greater improvements in vision over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, because ENCELTO delivers sustained, targeted doses of therapeutic proteins directly to the retina, it represents a versatile platform technology. This same approach could potentially be adapted to treat a wide range of neurovascular degenerative diseases beyond MacTel, including other blinding conditions where protecting vulnerable nerve cells is key.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two bacteria working in harmony show powerful antitumor effects. The approach could transform treatment for immunocompromised patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Professor Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), working in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. and the University of Tsukuba, has created a pioneering bacterial therapy for cancer that operates independently of the immune system. This new approach relies on a specially designed microbial consortium called AUN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of bacterial cancer therapy dates back to 1868, when German physician Busch reported that intentionally infecting a patient with bacteria led to tumor regression. Later, in 1893, Dr. William Coley proposed bacterial injections as a treatment, laying the foundation for cancer immunotherapy. Over the past 150 years, these early ideas evolved into advanced treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells. While effective for some, these therapies all depend on immune cell activity, which limits their effectiveness in patients whose immune systems are weakened by chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490803" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490803" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-777x700.jpg" alt="Schematic Illustration of A Gyo and UN Gyo" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-777x700.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-400x360.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-768x692.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-150x135.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-450x405.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo.jpg 909w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490803" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schematic illustration of A-gyo and UN-gyo. Credit: Eijiro Miyako from JAIST&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new AUN therapy overcomes this challenge by combining two naturally occurring bacterial strains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proteus mirabilis (A-gyo), a microbe that thrives within tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhodopseudomonas palustris (UN-gyo), a photosynthetic bacterium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mechanisms of tumor eradication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in close cooperation, the “AUN” bacterial pair achieved remarkable tumor clearance in both mouse and human cancer models, even under immunocompromised conditions—all without relying on immune cells. The therapy demonstrated strong biocompatibility and very limited side effects, notably preventing cytokine release syndrome (CRS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, AUN’s potent antitumor activity was driven by several coordinated bacterial mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Harmony between bacterial partners&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, UN-gyo functions as a regulatory partner only when coexisting with A-gyo, helping to suppress the pathogenicity of both strains while simultaneously enhancing their tumor-specific cytotoxicity. This “cooperation of labor” mirrors the Japanese philosophical concept of “AUN”—perfect harmony between opposites. It is this delicate and dynamic interplay between the two bacterial &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;species&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A species is a group of living organisms that share a set of common characteristics and are able to breed and produce fertile offspring. The concept of a species is important in biology as it is used to classify and organize the diversity of life. There are different ways to define a species, but the most widely accepted one is the biological species concept, which defines a species as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce viable offspring in nature. This definition is widely used in evolutionary biology and ecology to identify and classify living organisms.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; that unlocks the remarkable antitumor efficacy—a feat previously unattainable through conventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To accelerate the social implementation of this research, we are preparing to launch a startup and aim to begin clinical trials within six years,” said Professor Eijiro Miyako, lead author of the study.&lt;br&gt;
“A new chapter in bacteria-based cancer therapy—pursued for over 150 years—is finally beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary approach represents a paradigm shift for immunocompromised cancer patients. It offers a long-awaited therapeutic solution in cases where conventional immunotherapies fail—ushering in the dawn of truly immune-independent cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

The recipient, a 39-year-old man in China, was brain dead, but the organ survived for nine days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs, including hearts, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01613-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01613-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;livers&lt;/a&gt; and a thymus. The latest procedure suggests that almost any pig organ could be transplanted into people, researchers say. They hope that the animal organs might one day save the thousands of people who die each year while waiting for a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03794-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03794-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;donor organ&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lungs are the most difficult organ to transplant, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who in 2022 led the first pig–heart transplant into a living person. Lungs have the most blood vessels of any transplantable organ, so they are more prone to attack from the immune system, which can lead to blood clots and tissue damage, says Mohiuddin. “I applaud their effort,” he says: “it’s a first step” towards lung xenotransplantation, the use of organs from other species in humans. US clinical trials for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01209-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01209-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;pig livers&lt;/a&gt; and pig kidneys were approved this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proof of concept&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transplanted left lung was taken from a pig with six genomic edits that was created by research firm Chengdu Clonorgan Biotechnology in China. This included removing three genes to reduce the risk of the organ triggering an immune response and adding three human genes to protect the organ from rejection. In the proof-of-concept trial, the lung was transplanted on 15 May last year, by researchers at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China. Their findings were published this week in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team reports that there were no signs of rejection, infection or graft failure in the first three days after surgery. However, 24 hours after the transplant, they noticed the lung was swelling, and that the tissue was also damaged from going without oxygen for a period of time during the transplant procedure. They also observed damage caused by antibodies attacking the organ on day three and six, but noted that the damage to the lung had reduced on day nine, when the study was stopped at the request of the recipient’s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising awareness of ways to lower that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2746dd" class="body-graf"&gt;The study points to five risk factors that public health officials — and, in some cases, women themselves — can do something about: obesity, diabetes, smoking exposure, food insecurity and low levels of folate (an essential vitamin that helps the body produce cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f3b48" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the study, 66% of women ages 12 to 49 have at least one of these risk factors, and 10% have three or more. The CDC’s findings, &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00438-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, are based on responses from 5,374 women who completed the agency’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59ba56" class="body-graf"&gt;“We can’t underscore enough how important it is to raise awareness about these risk factors and encourage women to speak with their doctors if they have any concerns or questions before becoming pregnant,” Arick Wang, a health scientist at the CDC and the lead author of the new study, said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39d619" class="body-graf"&gt;She added that the “risks can be lowered through steps like getting the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily, healthy diet and exercise, and managing blood sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2769f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Birth defects are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/infant-mortality/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of death in infants&lt;/a&gt;, according to CDC data. The risks often start before some women even know they’re pregnant. Though the causes of birth defects are largely a mystery, scientists generally recognize that some combination of genetics, environment and lifestyle factors is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-160a62" class="body-graf"&gt;“This should be a wake up call to all of us,” said Dr. Michael Warren, chief medical and health officer of March of Dimes, a nonprofit research and advocacy group focused on maternal and infant health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34eb2" class="body-graf"&gt;“We want to make sure that people have access to nutritious foods,” said Warren, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We want to make sure that people have safe places to be physically active.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe2186" class="body-graf"&gt;People with food insecurity can be deficient in nutrients that are vital for a fetus’ organs to develop properly, including folate. For instance, low concentrations of folate in the blood are associated with neural tube defects — brain or spine defects that develop in the first month of pregnancy. Doctors recommend that people who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant take folic acid, the synthetic version of folate.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d50f31" class="body-graf"&gt;Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required that enriched cereal-grain products be fortified with folic acid. Wang, the CDC scientist, said in a press release that the policy likely prevents more than 1,300 babies each year from being born without neural tube defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4353b2" class="body-graf"&gt;“The vast majority of birth defects that occur, we still don’t know why they occur,” Nembhard said. “Even when women do everything right — they don’t smoke, they don’t drink during pregnancy, they monitor caffeine intake, they exercise — you can still have an outcome that is not what you wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f3cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;Warren, who until June served as associate administrator of HHS’ Maternal and Child Health Bureau, said many women might not be aware that conditions like obesity and food insecurity are also risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c841b" class="body-graf"&gt;Obesity, which affected roughly one-third of the women surveyed, was the most common modifiable risk factor in the CDC study. Scientists aren’t exactly clear on why it’s linked to birth defects, but they suspect it has something to do with changes to a woman’s metabolism — such as the way her body manages insulin and glucose — that may lead to abnormal development in the fetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90f59a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When [our] cells are growing and forming organs, we really rely on everything to be working just as it should. And when you disrupt those processes, things can go awry,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f0317b" class="body-graf"&gt;High blood sugar from diabetes may also lead to abnormal organ development, he said. And some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke, including nicotine, can reduce the supply of oxygen to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a0cc2" class="body-graf"&gt;Warren said there’s more to be done. He pointed to Mississippi, which &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/23,30305,341.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; last week over its high infant mortality rates and pledged to eliminate “care deserts,” where women don’t have access to obstetricians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df275c" class="body-graf"&gt;Outside researchers lauded the study’s release amid layoffs and proposed funding cuts to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976572" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re delighted that this study has been ongoing. There were some questions about whether or not it would continue,” said Wendy Nembhard, director of the Arkansas Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d8bba" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services in March &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced the termination of 2,400 CDC employees&lt;/a&gt;.

At least 600 CDC employees are still &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-layoffs-827585f95b24d7dfdf99dd453960a991" target="_blank"&gt;expected to receive permanent termination notices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 04:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQcW9BMDdDWXFzMGJkRUs2bElMTGhmUXJmalFRZnZKTWc2dU5iYnU4Z0FhYUdEMWhFZ0V3RURvM3dTbU5FdURvQ0gxRXJSTnJYR3FDV0x1N0VBem9MeGRtNXRELUkwOHVoRjFwWXZPTElITU85dVRCMDJHakJycGJOejFmVWF1WDQwbmNBS19kV21iRHIwWE4xWUJhRlY4Z3IwYS1aYnFhejRtUWZpeXV3Y1gyTdIBVkFVX3lxTFBTUUhXNDEwdVNyZUROTEZVTUI0S0ZMZG1DX2phTzVpSnlQcmxmUWFZemJJV1VtMEo5cld0bjBWc3VVQmhwMHdQN1FOa2VUVWJDQ29IVVln</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心发现，大多数50岁以下的女性都有可以降低的出生缺陷的风险因素- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-women-under-50-risk-040500077.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One in 33 babies in the United States are born with birth defects.

&lt;p&gt;According to scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in the southern Chinese city of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/china-several-dead-after-ship-hits-bridge-in-guangzhou/a-68334582"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, the pig lung, which was transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, "maintained viability and functionality" for 216 hours (nine days) without becoming infected or being rejected by its host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is xenotransplantation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transplantation of organs across species is known as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/could-pigs-hearts-soon-beat-in-human-bodies/a-46615611"&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/a&gt; and has been touted as a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x" title="External link — Guangzhou study"&gt;Guangzhou study&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, advancements have recently been made in heart and kidney xenotransplantation from pigs to humans, but lungs present "distinct challenges" due to their "anatomical and physiological complexity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the direct contact of the lung with the outside air naturally increases the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the genetically altered lung transplanted from the 22-month-old, 70-kilogram, male, Chinese Bama Xiang pig to the 39-year-old male human patient survived and functioned for over a week of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates that genetically modified pig lungs can maintain viability and functionality in brain-dead recipients for 216 hours without signs of hyperacute rejection or evidence of uncontrolled infection," concluded the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This success highlights the progress made in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies but also underscores key challenges that must be addressed for clinical translation."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Most people know they should drink more water, but our &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00408.2025"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; reveals an unexpected consequence of falling short: it could be making everyday stress significantly harder to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;, found that people who drank less than 1.5 litres daily showed dramatically higher levels of cortisol – the body's primary stress hormone – when faced with stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding suggests that chronic mild dehydration may amplify stress responses in ways we're only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-study-lists-health-benefits-of-drinking-more-water-each-day"&gt;First of Its Kind Study Lists Health Benefits of Drinking More Water Each Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested healthy young adults by dividing them into two groups based on their usual fluid intake. One group drank less than 1.5 litres daily, while the other exceeded standard recommendations of roughly two litres for women and 2.5 litres for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172109" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress1_642.jpg" alt="man drinking water from a bottle" class="wp-image-172109 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress1_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress1_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress1_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172109" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Guidelines recommend men drink 2.5 litres of water each day. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEAO3-O2_M/"&gt;kieferpix/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After maintaining these patterns for a week, participants faced a laboratory stress test involving public speaking and mental arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups felt equally nervous and showed similar heart rate increases. But the low-fluid group experienced a much more pronounced cortisol surge – a response that could prove problematic if repeated daily over months or years. Chronic elevation of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104599"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; has been linked to increased risks of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.130949"&gt;heart disease, kidney problems and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the under-hydrated participants didn't report feeling thirstier than their well-hydrated counterparts. Their bodies, however, told a different story. Darker, more concentrated urine revealed their dehydration, demonstrating that thirst isn't always a reliable indicator of fluid needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism behind this stress amplification involves the body's sophisticated water management system. When dehydration is detected, the brain releases vasopressin, a hormone that instructs the kidneys to conserve water and maintain blood volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vasopressin doesn't work in isolation, it also influences the brain's stress-response system, potentially heightening cortisol release during difficult moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Double burden&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a physiological double burden. Although vasopressin helps preserve precious water, it simultaneously makes the body more reactive to stress. For someone navigating daily pressures – work deadlines, family responsibilities, financial concerns – this heightened reactivity could accumulate into significant health harms over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings add hydration to the growing list of lifestyle factors that influence stress resilience. Sleep, exercise, nutrition and social connections all play roles in how we handle life's challenges. Water now emerges as a potentially underappreciated ally in stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172110" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress2_642.jpg" alt="woman looking stressed" class="wp-image-172110 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hydration_stress2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172110" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Good hydration is just one factor in stress resilience. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEI02s9Mk8/"&gt;DMP/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications extend beyond individual physiology. In societies where chronic stress is increasingly recognised as a public health crisis, hydration emerges as a surprisingly accessible intervention. Unlike many stress-management strategies that require significant time or resources, drinking adequate water is straightforward and universally available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our research doesn't suggest that water is a cure-all for stress. The study involved healthy young adults in controlled laboratory conditions, which cannot fully replicate the complex psychological and social stressors people face in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration alone cannot address all aspects of real-world stress. We need long-term studies to confirm whether maintaining optimal hydration genuinely reduces stress-related health problems over years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual water needs vary considerably based on age, body size, activity levels and climate. &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1459"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; provide useful targets, but tea,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="172103" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, milk and water-rich foods also contribute to daily fluid intake. The key is consistency rather than perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple check involves monitoring &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/hydration/"&gt;urine colour&lt;/a&gt;: pale yellow typically indicates adequate hydration, while darker shades suggest increased fluid needs. This practical approach removes guesswork from an essential daily habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-the-colour-of-pee-green-pink-yellow-says-about-health"&gt;This Handy Infographic Shows What The Colour of Your Pee Says About Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good health stems from accumulated daily choices rather than dramatic interventions. Although proper hydration won't eliminate life's pressures, it might help ensure your body is better equipped to handle them. In a world where stress feels inevitable, that physiological advantage could prove more valuable than we've previously recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water remains &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2009.111"&gt;essential for life&lt;/a&gt; in ways that extend far beyond basic survival. Our research suggests it may also be essential for managing the psychological demands of modern life, offering a simple but powerful tool for supporting both physical and mental resilience.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263361/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Another type – Salmonella Dublin – is primarily associated with cattle and can cause more severe illness in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors see more bloodstream infections, longer hospital stays, and a higher risk of severe outcomes when this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10803612/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dangerous bacteria&lt;/a&gt; infects people, which it has started doing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does it get there? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-raw-milk-health-hazard-pasteurization-important/"&gt;Unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt; and undercooked beef are common routes, and contact with sick animals can spread it too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not only a farm issue; it is a public health issue because what happens around cattle does not always stay around cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humans-cattle-and-salmonella-dublin"&gt;Humans, cattle, and Salmonella Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have wrestled with a practical question: Are the Salmonella Dublin strains in cattle, people, and farm-linked environments in the United States different or basically the same? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer shapes how we prevent infections and how we handle antibiotics. If the strains match closely across settings, the effective approach should connect animal health, human health, and environmental monitoring – an idea many researchers call “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One Health&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This catchy phrase isn’t just a slogan. If the same bug moves between species and spaces without changing much, targeting only one part of the supply chain system will not be enough. We need solutions that address the pathogen wherever it travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-salmonella-dublin"&gt;Studying Salmonella Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers gathered Salmonella Dublin from three places: sick cattle, sick people, and environmental sites tied to farms or processing facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they sequenced the bacteria’s DNA to compare how closely the strains were related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In genetics, scientists track tiny letter-level changes called single nucleotide polymorphisms (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/genomicresearch/snp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNPs&lt;/a&gt;), pronounced “snips.” Fewer SNP differences mean the strains likely share a recent common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to see whether strains from cows, people, and the environment clustered into separate groups or stayed together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they stayed together, that would point to active movement between hosts and places, not isolated pockets of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-so-far"&gt;What we know so far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team learned that strains from cattle, humans, and the environment in the U.S. were extremely similar – often differing by only a small number of SNPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers reported that despite some genetic differences across 2,150 Salmonella Dublin strains, the bacteria remained highly similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This similarity shows potential for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reverse-zoonoses-humans-are-getting-their-pets-sick/"&gt;cross-transmission&lt;/a&gt; between cattle, humans, and the environment,” explained team leader and senior author Erika Ganda, an associate professor of food animal microbiomes in the Penn State &lt;a href="https://agsci.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;College of Agricultural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s important, because it shows that Salmonella Dublin is highly connected across humans, animals and the environment – so efforts to control it need to consider all three,” Ganda continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study’s findings provide detailed genetic evidence that can help guide surveillance – tracking the bacteria, intervention strategies such as limiting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-increasing-enterococci-looming-global-crisis/"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; in livestock and public health policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-salmonella-dublin-has-a-tight-family-tree"&gt;Salmonella Dublin has a tight family tree&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic picture does not split into distant branches based on where or when strains were found. It looks like a “tight family tree.” That suggests ongoing movement between animals, people, and farm environments or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of connected pattern matters for hospital readiness, farm policies, and everyday choices at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-increases-threat-antimicrobial-resistance/"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;. They did not stop at asking whether resistance existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They checked which resistance genes appeared and how those patterns differed among strains from cows, people, and the environment. They found meaningful differences across those sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means control strategies should match the resistance patterns in each place. A one-size-fits-all antibiotic plan is unlikely to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsible antibiotic use requires laboratory testing and clear guidelines, not guesswork, to protect drugs that still work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farms-families-and-food-chains"&gt;Farms, families, and food chains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention starts before anyone gets sick. On farms, that includes biosecurity to keep new or sick animals from spreading infection, plus cleaning and disinfection that reach tough spots. In the food chain, the basics work: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;pasteurize milk&lt;/a&gt; and cook beef thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For home kitchens, avoid raw milk and use a thermometer. Ground beef should reach 160°F, and whole cuts like steaks should reach 145°F with a rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinics and hospitals, rapid laboratory testing helps clinicians avoid antibiotics that will not work. When lab teams can see the resistance profile early, patients get better treatment sooner, and we save the stronger drugs for when they are truly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-resolution-genome-map"&gt;High-resolution genome map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing turns thousands of bacterial samples into a high-resolution “map.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing SNP differences across many strains, scientists can connect dots that older methods might miss, including hidden links between farm sources and human cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means public health teams can focus on the pathways doing most of the harm. Targeted steps beat broad, blunt strategies, especially when resources and time are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-salmonella-dublin-and-human-health"&gt;Salmonella Dublin and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a fear story or some type of political stunt. It’s a highly-coordinated scientific study driven by peer-reviewed evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Salmonella Dublin population looks tightly knit and changes only a little as it spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clarity helps, because it points to a shared job and a big “to-do” list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials must strengthen surveillance that connects animal, human, and environmental samples; tailor antibiotic guidelines to the resistance patterns seen in each source; and block obvious transmission routes with pasteurization, thorough cooking, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-confirm-first-case-of-rare-parasite-in-pigs-posing-health-risks/"&gt;farm hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, and smart infection control in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the same pathogen keeps appearing in cows, people, and nearby environments, showing a nearly identical genetic profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a shared target and coordinated defenses, we stand a better chance of stopping it before it reaches pandemic levels by starting on someone’s dinner plate, ending up in the bloodstream, and spreading from there like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00689-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 01:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNEJSSlBKcWcxa3ZHZ0MwR29zVmNQWkw3SnZhRTgtdGtpaC1GRVFOLTR4OUVJMXpDTjRoSGpqSFpPMmtobXNuU2FjR0pLU0ZRTFFKV3ZpeEVvOHE5YTgwNThsSnNHbG91elB4NWNvSUV4cUlMZV9UaUl6THI0QVJYSmk1Rm1paVIxM3kzbC11VmRJejVpcnNfUlNrV2RsaVo3T3B1ZDF3MGpPNnM</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 50岁以上的女性应该吃5种抗炎食物- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-for-women-over-50-11794640</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries, beans, greens, salmon and nuts can help reduce inflammation and protect health after 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These foods provide antioxidants, fiber, protein and minerals to support brain, bone and muscle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy aging also requires movement, quality sleep, social connection and regular health checkups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you hit 50, you might be among the women either in the midst of or approaching menopause. This phase of life may bring digestive issues, hot flashes, weaker bones and muscles, and chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also a time where taking care of your brain and body are all the more important so you can age healthily. Fortunately, some nutrition changes can help reduce inflammation and manage other health issues that may arise in midlife. Dietitians recommend eating plenty of berries, beans, leafy greens, nuts and fatty fish to boost your intake of antioxidants, fiber, calcium, healthy fats and protein.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries—all are rich in antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and support healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “I love recommending these because they’re easy to add on to foods that you might already be eating, like your morning yogurt or your midday snack plate,” says &lt;a href="https://www.loveyourchichos.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Zariel Grullón, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.re a key part of the MIND diet—an eating pattern designed to help prevent dementia and other forms of cognitive decline. Given that 2 out of 3 Americans experience cognitive decline by age 70, eating foods that support brain health is valuable for healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries are a key part of the MIND diet—an eating pattern designed to help prevent dementia and other forms of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given that 2 out of 3 Americans experience cognitive decline by age 70, eating foods that support brain health is valuable for healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain compounds called peptides, polyphenols and saponins that have anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Getting a mix of beans makes sure you’re feeling fuller longer and also helps to fight off excess inflammation in the body,” says Grullón.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, beans are full of fiber to support a healthy gut microbiome, which may help manage menopause-related gut issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll get about half of your daily fiber needs in just 1 cup of black beans!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also provide valuable plant protein that can help prevent age-related muscle loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are great because, similar to the berries, we can add them as a side to any meal, whether it’s refried or stewed beans in the morning, or a dense bean salad to supplement your lunches,” says Grullón. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, watercress and bok choy are loaded with beneficial nutrients and phytochemicals that [quash] inflammation and help reduce oxidative stress,” says &lt;a href="https://seemashahrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Seema Shah, M.P.H., M.S., RD, IFNCP, WIMI-CP&lt;/a&gt;. This includes vitamins A, C, E and K, as well as powerful polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Several dark leafy greens also contain plant chemicals like sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, which inhibit several pro-inflammatory pathways in the body,” says Shah. Like most other foods on this list, they’re also a source of fiber, “which helps with immune modulation, blood sugar management and the lowering of inflammatory processes,” says Shah. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During menopause, drops in estrogen can wreak havoc on bone health, so it’s even more important to eat enough calcium when you’re in this phase of life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Dark leafy greens are especially rich in bone-building minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium,” says Shah.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you only think of dark leafy greens as a salad base, consider broadening your horizons. “When you’re tired of making salad, but are still trying to increase greens, consider a plant-based smoothie that balances the fruit with dark leafy greens,” recommends &lt;a href="https://ladybugnutrition.com/#" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamie Baham, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salmon is worth adding to your diet since it’s chock-full of omega-3s—fatty acids well-known for their anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Including one to two servings of fatty fish per week can support heart health, reduce stiffness associated with arthritis and help preserve brain function. For women in this age group, it’s also a great source of high-quality protein and vitamin D—two nutrients that support muscle mass and bone strength,” says &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/elizabeth-oconnor" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lizzie O’Connor, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are lots of tasty ways to add this inflammation-fighting food to your diet. “One of my favorite ways to incorporate fatty fish into my weekly regimen is making homemade poke bowls with salmon, brown rice, avocado, cucumber and a drizzle of soy sauce. It’s a delicious sushi-in-a-bowl delight that has been a repeat in my home,” says Baham.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A handful of nuts offers a number of antioxidants and heart-healthy nutrients—such as phytosterols, selenium, magnesium, tocopherols, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and fiber. Nuts make for a convenient snack whether you’re at home or on the go. Thanks to their robust nutrition profile, nuts can help lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Almonds and walnuts appear to be especially helpful for lowering inflammation, while Brazil nuts help reduce oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Particularly if you don’t eat fish, walnuts are worth adding to your diet for their inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

For the most benefits, incorporate a mix of cardio, strength training, balancing and stretching into your workout routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialize:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness and social isolation can increase your risk of chronic disease and early death. So, make an effort to maintain or develop quality relationships as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize your sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies show that good-quality sleep is linked with lower rates of disease and disability, and better physical and mental functioning with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So look at sleep as an essential part of your wellness routine!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular health checkups:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t underestimate the importance of keeping up with your health care visits and vaccinations. It can help prevent illness, catch health issues early and/or manage existing health issues proactively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you approach midlife and beyond, making a few dietary changes can help ward off chronic disease and inflammation. Foods like berries, beans, leafy greens, salmon and nuts can be especially beneficial. By adding these foods throughout your day, you’ll boost your intake of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fiber and healthy fats. You’ll also get key nutrients for brain, muscle and bone health to support healthy aging. In addition to adding more of these foods, don’t underestimate the power of physical activity, sleep and socialization! These, along with getting regular health checkups, are also central to aging well.&lt;br&gt;

In a groundbreaking study, they found that a daily dose of vitamin D may help preserve DNA and keep people biologically younger by years. The trial, called VITAL, tracked more than 1,000 adults over four years and has just been published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the Harvard study found&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tested 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 daily—about three times the recommended amount, but still within the safe upper limit of 4,000 IU. Participants taking the supplement showed significantly less DNA damage compared to those who received a placebo. Researchers measured telomeres—protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are strongly linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, Chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She added, “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, participants on vitamin D lost far less telomere length than the placebo group, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging. First study author Dr. Haidong Zhu, a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, said: “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use vitamin D safely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, experts caution against overuse. Most adults are advised to take 600–800 IU daily, while supplements commonly come in doses of 1,000–2,000 IU. Taking more than 4,000 IU per day can be harmful, leading to a dangerous buildup of calcium in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can cause nausea, vomiting, constipation, kidney stones, and even organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harvard researchers stress that while vitamin D shows great potential, the trial was relatively short and lacked diversity, as most participants were white.

GEORGE — Two school-aged children in Washington County have tested positive for measles, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children's schools have been notified of potential exposure — school started on Aug. 11 in Washington County — as have parents of students who attend the schools, a statement from the health department says. All unvaccinated children and adults who believe they have been exposed to the disease are also encouraged to stay home for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of immunocompromised children are advised to consider keeping those youngsters home for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwest Utah health officials said measles symptoms typically start seven to 14 days after exposure, which was on Aug. 21 in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include "a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash that starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. While most people recover at home, some people — especially children — can experience complications of breathing problems, pneumonia, brain swelling, seizures, hospitalization, and even death," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, school employees, children and anyone else exposed to measles are encouraged to call their health care provider before going to be evaluated at a medical facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Residents should make sure that they and their children are caught up on vaccinations as soon as possible," the health department said..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:26:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNNlAyTmtONU5xMmFocHg2VXlGUEJ2U3UyVVc0R3NHT012cHllanpfaFlWVnVma3UtT3JfMFYwMDM0RklETHJYQnpDcFI2cDJvMGNHQURVemd1Vk9YZ2JJVFRwa3gxcnJHWnk2NVcwMmRIb210UUxsLWpoZ182Vjk1Y2hhNi1GLVFYUldTZng4Q2pkbklha1VWeDBORmt5Z09XTDhtTklDUzZDdw</guid></item><item><title>强迫症患者的大脑活动中出现了一种独特的模式- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-pattern-emerges-in-the-brain-activity-of-people-with-ocd</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder"&gt;Obsessive–compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (OCD) negatively impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide, but more effective treatments could be on the way after researchers were able to identify specific neural biomarkers associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers are patterns of brain activity present in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ocd-is-a-serious-illness-and-its-more-common-than-you-think"&gt;people with OCD&lt;/a&gt; when they're acting compulsively, and which don't show up the rest of the time. While it's difficult to know exactly what these firing neurons are doing, their patterns could help understand the condition – and figure out how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the researchers looked at data from electrodes implanted in the brains of 11 people with chronic OCD, seeing how their brain activity changed over time in reaction to compulsive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-woman-receives-revolutionary-brain-implant-for-ocd-and-epilepsy"&gt;US Woman Receives Revolutionary Brain Implant For OCD And Epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have found a clear biological marker for OCD in the brain, a marker that we may be able to use in future treatments for OCD," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tara Arbab of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns were put into four stages: baseline (sitting quietly), &lt;a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/obsessions/"&gt;obsession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/compulsions/"&gt;compulsion&lt;/a&gt;, and relief (post-compulsion). An obsession might be avoiding dirty surfaces, for example, with the compulsion being washing hands; these were tailored for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart.jpg" alt="Brain waves chart" class="wp-image-171260 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart-600x359.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers measured brain waves during different phases. (Arbab et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain waves of two specific frequencies, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wave"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;, were noticeably prominent during compulsive acts. These electrical signals surged across all brain regions, and were observed for both mental and physical compulsions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In psychiatry, it is almost never possible to link a symptom so directly to brain activity," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arbab. "This study shows that it is possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were able to measure deep brain activity with very high spatial and temporal precision. That's not possible with an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants had all received various forms of treatment for their OCD, without success. The implants used as brain monitors here had already been implanted prior to the study so that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (DBS) could be tried as a therapy approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many different parts to OCD that it's difficult to be certain about how it works: scientists have also looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/record-study-connects-hundreds-of-genetic-markers-with-ocd"&gt;genetic influences&lt;/a&gt; and links &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ocds-origins-might-not-lie-in-the-brain-like-we-thought"&gt;to gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; for clues about how the condition starts and how it persists. The severity of OCD can vary quite significantly from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OCD treatments go, DBS isn't often used, and is still in an experimental stage. The idea is to control brain signaling to some extent, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i9.659"&gt;it can work well&lt;/a&gt; – but questions remain about long-term effectiveness and potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new information gathered in this study, the DBS approach could perhaps be made more targeted and effective. Further down the line, it might even be possible to artificially manipulate brain waves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-brain-signals-associated-with-ocd-for-the-first-time"&gt;during compulsive episodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's still some way off, but we do now know more about how OCD changes activity in the brain: where these changes happen, and how long they last for. These 'neural signatures' for the disorder are being slowly built up, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-neural-signature-of-ocd-has-been-identified-in-the-human-brain"&gt;piece by piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been doing [DBS] in animal models for years, but in patients, this technology is still new," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arbab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00457-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have trouble pooping in the morning, eating dinner at the right time might help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GI experts say eating dinner three hours before bed may help you go in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It gives your body time for digestion and works with your body’s natural rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most people, a morning poop can feel like the perfect start to the day. Your body feels lighter, your mind is at ease, and you’re ready to move on without worrying about when nature will call. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to set yourself up for that smooth morning bathroom trip, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat dinner matters almost as much as what’s on your plate. Digestive-health experts say that finishing your last meal about three hours before bedtime can give your digestive system the time it needs to do its job. This early-evening eating window takes advantage of your gut’s natural rhythms, prevents &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-to-poop-the-next-morning-11774654" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sluggish digestion overnight&lt;/a&gt; and can help you stay regular without relying on more stimulating methods like coffee or laxatives. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, pooping in the morning is not essential. But it does come with some advantages. “Mornings are convenient because your body is naturally primed to eliminate after waking and eating, and it can set a nice one-and-done rhythm before the day gets busy,” says gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbassmd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michael Bass, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you could use some help getting things going in the morning, here’s how eating dinner three hours before bed can give your gut the kick start it needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-3-hours-before-bed-is-the-best-time-to-eat-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why 3 Hours Before Bed Is the Best Time to Eat Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Gives Your Body Enough Time for Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your digestive system is most active during the day, and it naturally slows down in the evening.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If you finish dinner at least two to three hours before bed, you give your body time to digest enough so that, by morning, the colon is ready to move things along,” explains Bass. Wrapping up dinner about three hours before bed allows your gut to focus on processing your meal while you’re awake instead of trying to multitask while you sleep. That digestive break can lead to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoother, more predictable bowel movement&lt;/a&gt; the next morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps Train Your Gut &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our guts love routine almost as much as our brains do. Eating around the same time each night helps train your digestive system to follow a regular pattern. “The body thrives on rhythm and patterns more so than isolated events, so focusing on &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; sleep and wake times, meal patterns, movement and adequate hydration is most important,” points out &lt;a href="https://www.staceycollinsnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacey Collins, M.A., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Stacey Collins Nutrition, a gastrointestinal-focused registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your body gets used to receiving food at consistent times, it tends to respond in kind, often with a morning bathroom visit right on schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Syncs with Circadian &amp;amp; Digestive Rhythms &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like your sleep-wake cycle, digestion runs on an internal 24-hour clock known as your circadian rhythm. “The body is usually primed for a morning bowel movement due to cortisol shifts with the body’s natural circadian rhythm,” says Collins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By eating earlier in the evening, you’re aligning your mealtime with your body’s natural digestive peak. That sync-up can mean &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-to-prevent-bloating-throughout-the-day-11782328" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less bloating at night&lt;/a&gt; and a better shot at a timely trip to the bathroom after breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-promote-regular-bowel-movements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Promote Regular Bowel Movements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Timing is essential, but these evening habits can also set you up for success the next morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate Well. &lt;/strong&gt;Water helps keep stool soft and easy to pass, and your colon can’t do its job without it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, don’t skimp on fluids when you eat dinner. Herbal tea, water or even a broth-based soup all count. Just keep in mind that gulping large amounts of liquid right before bed might have you up for reasons other than a morning bathroom trip. And don’t neglect your water first thing in the morning, either. “A big glass of water right after waking can kick-start your gut,” says Bass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber adds bulk to stool and helps it move through your digestive tract more efficiently. At dinner, aim for a mix of soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber, found in foods like beans, lentils, oats, nuts, apples, pears, oranges and strawberries, helps soften stool. Insoluble fiber, in whole grains and many veggies, bulks things up to keep them moving along.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take It Easy on Sodium. &lt;/strong&gt;Research has found that people with high sodium intake are more prone to constipation. Conversely, people who eat more low-sodium whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean protein (especially plant protein and seafood) tend to be more regular.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move a Little After Dinner. &lt;/strong&gt;A brisk walk after your evening meal can gently stimulate digestion and keep things moving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it’s a great way to wind down without heading straight for the couch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Magnesium Before Bed. &lt;/strong&gt;“Nighttime magnesium could help stimulate a morning bowel movement,” says Collins. That’s because magnesium pulls water into your gut, lubricating your stool so it’s easier to pass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bonus: Some people feel magnesium helps promote sleep. While more studies are needed to confirm this association, a nighttime magnesium supplement could be an added plus if it also helps you poop in the a.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the Late-Night Snack. &lt;/strong&gt; “Late-night snacks can muddy the waters a bit,” says Bass. “If you’re grazing right up until bedtime, that can blunt the ‘overnight reset’ and make your morning bowel reflex less predictable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating dinner about three hours before you hit the hay is a smart way to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your body’s natural rhythms to help you poop in the morning. This interval gives your body enough time to digest your dinner, creates a predictable pattern for your digestive system and syncs with your body’s circadian rhythm. Like most health-related habits, consistency is key, says Collins. So, try to stick with this timing as often as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For your best shot at regular morning bowel movements, pair this habit with plenty of water, fiber-rich, low-sodium whole foods, magnesium supplements and an after-dinner stroll. As helpful as these strategies may be, it can be good to know there’s no such thing as the perfect time to go to the bathroom. “Don’t stress if you skip a morning or two,” says Bass. “Regular means what’s normal for your body, not the same time every day.”&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a drink most people enjoy every day. But consuming it while taking common antibiotics may raise the risk of being sickened by deadly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from three countries evaluated nearly 100 chemical substances and how they interacted with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-1bf3f850-81b6-11f0-9cfc-a5f058e671f2"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, a type of bacteria that can cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772061/safety-warning-popular-healthy-food-deadly-bacteria.html"&gt;diarrhea, cramps and vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that coffee - or, more specifically, caffeine caused E. coli to absorb a lower level of common antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which is prescribed to treat everything from urinary tract to skin and respiratory infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes the antibiotics less effective in treating infections caused by E. coli bacteria, known as antibiotic resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, antibiotic resistance makes bacterial infections impossible to treat, increasing the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effects of caffeine were specific to E. coli, which sickens more than 250,000 Americans every year. Caffeine did not weaken antibiotic treatments for similar bacteria like salmonella.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as about two-thirds of Americans report drinking coffee, one of the most prevalent sources of caffeine, every day along with tea and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common source of E. Coli is undercooked ground beef, where bacteria can spread during processing. Leafy greens like romaine and spinach are another major culprit, along with raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caffeine in drinks like coffee may lower the effectiveness of common antibiotics, a new study has suggested (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E. coli bacteria can cause infections leading to bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people recover within a week, but some people can become severely ill and develop a dangerous kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 265,000 Americans are sickened by E. coli every year and over 3,000 are hospitalized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report about 61 deaths from the bacteria each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260#sec009"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 94 different chemical substances and their effects on E. coli and salmonella. The substances ranged from antibiotics to prescription drugs to everyday chemicals like caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers evaluated the effect on transporter genes, which control what enters and leaves cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found caffeine activates the protein Rob, which stops as much Cipro from entering cells, rendering it less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ana Rita Brochado, study author and biological engineer at the University of Tübingen in Germany, said: 'Caffeine triggers a cascade of events starting with the gene regulator Rob and culminating in the change of several transport proteins in E. coli – which in turn leads to a reduced uptake of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted because the experiments were carried out with cell samples, it's unclear if the same results would be true in human studies. However, they plan to conduct further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study found caffeine affected the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which is filled about 4million times a year in the US (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also unclear how much caffeine exactly would weaken antibiotics like Cipro against E. coli and if there are specific differences between caffeine sources like coffee and tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers estimate that 4million prescriptions for Cipro are filled every year, making it one of the most common antibiotics in drugs like amoxicillin and doxycycline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Based on these findings, we foresee a challenging, but unavoidable and important task in mapping key determinants of transport functions across different bacteria.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It then uses machine learning to recognise patterns that would be difficult for humans to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Currently, the disease is usually diagnosed using a mix of scans and biopsies, such as an ultrasound scan, a CT scan, a needle biopsy, a laparoscopy or surgery to remove tissue or possibly the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is often detected late because symptoms such as bloating, feeling full quickly after eating or having to pee frequently are not always obvious potential signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood test looks for what ovarian cancer sheds into the bloodstream, even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cancer cells release fragments into the blood that carry tiny, fat-like molecules known as lipids, along with certain proteins. This combination of lipids and proteins are like a biological fingerprint for ovarian cancer, according to AOA Dx, which developed the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also uses an algorithm that has been trained on thousands of patient samples to recognise subtle patterns across these lipids and proteins that signal ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test can detect the disease “at early stages and with greater accuracy than current tools”, according to Alex Fisher, the chief operating officer and co-founder of AOA Dx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Abigail McElhinny, the chief science officer at AOA Dx, added: “By using machine learning to combine multiple biomarker types, we’ve developed a diagnostic tool that detects ovarian cancer across the molecular complexity of the disease in sub-types and stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This platform offers a great opportunity to improve the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, potentially resulting in better patient outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A study, led by the universities of Manchester and Colorado and published in the American Association of Cancer Research journal Cancer Research Communications, tested 832 samples using the AOA Dx platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In samples from the University of Colorado, the test was able to accurately detect ovarian cancer across all stages of the disease 93% of the time, and 91% in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In samples from the University of Manchester, the test showed 92% accuracy at all stages and 88% accuracy in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Emma Crosbie, a professor at the University of Manchester and an honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, said: “AOA Dx’s platform has the potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are eager to continue advancing this important research through additional prospective trials to further validate and expand our understanding of how this could be integrated into existing healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOa28xVURldzBqTXhVR0Q5Ql80U1JYRjVLaWlKUVhWNUpqS3ZLUHI4NE9xVU1MWElnZnhDbGZoRnBmZ1ozdm9meWVabTBxQ2R0cVZCaEw3aGxBY1FKV2hWeGphWXpwZ0FoMmJrbVVQM1BNMWNPbE1LOGQwRzE0WmYweXpHenZQSFMyM3V4UWxhZFhGRGtMMEpwNm8tZFFnQTZlenVDZ3J0OEtxak5wRTBNVWYyVQ</guid></item><item><title>60年后，科学家发现糖尿病药物二甲双胍背后的隐藏大脑通路- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/after-60-years-scientists-uncover-hidden-brain-pathway-behind-diabetes-drug-metformin/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

A new study from Baylor College of Medicine reveals a surprising player: the brain. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists found that metformin acts in the brain through Rap1 to control blood sugar. This insight could lead to more precise diabetes treatments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin has been the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes for more than six decades, yet scientists still do not fully understand how it works. A team from Baylor College of Medicine, working with international collaborators, has now identified an unexpected factor in its effectiveness: the brain. Their findings reveal a brain pathway involved in metformin’s glucose-lowering action, pointing to new strategies for treating diabetes with greater precision.

&lt;p&gt;“It’s been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver. Other studies have found that it acts through the gut,” explained Dr. Makoto Fukuda, associate professor of pediatrics – nutrition at Baylor and the study’s corresponding author. “We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concentrated on a small protein called Rap1, located in a region of the brain known as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). They discovered that metformin’s ability to lower blood sugar at clinically relevant doses depends on suppressing Rap1 activity in this brain area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rap1 protein and experimental evidence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the Fukuda lab and collaborators studied genetically engineered mice that lacked Rap1 in their ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). These mice were placed on a high-fat diet to simulate type 2 diabetes. When treated with low doses of metformin, their blood sugar levels did not decrease. In contrast, other diabetes drugs, including &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; and GLP-1 agonists, remained effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the evidence that the brain plays a central role, the researchers administered extremely small amounts of metformin directly into the brains of diabetic mice. This approach produced a marked reduction in blood sugar, even when the doses were thousands of times lower than those typically given orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neuronal activation in the hypothalamus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin’s effects,” Fukuda said. “We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they’re directly involved in the drug’s action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain slices, the scientists recorded the electrical activity of these neurons. Metformin made most of them more active, but only if Rap1 was present. In mice lacking Rap1 in these neurons, metformin had no effect, showing that Rap1 is essential for metformin to “switch on” these brain cells and lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This discovery changes how we think about metformin,” Fukuda said. “It’s not just working in the liver or the gut, it’s also acting in the brain. We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although few anti-diabetic drugs act on the brain, this study shows that widely used metformin has been doing so all along. “These findings open the door to developing new diabetes treatments that directly target this pathway in the brain,” Fukuda said. “In addition, metformin is known for other health benefits, such as slowing brain aging. We plan to investigate whether this same brain Rap1 signaling is responsible for other well-documented effects of the drug on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut microbes produce D-lactate that worsens metabolism. A trap for it restores healthier blood sugar and liver function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Canadian researchers has identified an unexpected way to lower blood sugar and protect the liver: by capturing a little-known fuel produced by gut bacteria before it enters the body and causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, could open the door to new therapies to treat metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Microbial molecule disrupts metabolism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from McMaster University, Université Laval, and the University of Ottawa discovered that a molecule generated by gut microbes can cross into the bloodstream, where it drives the liver to overproduce glucose and fat. By designing a method to trap this molecule in the gut before it reaches circulation, they achieved striking improvements in blood sugar regulation and fatty liver disease in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway,” says Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster. “We’ve known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose — a process called the Cori cycle. What we’ve discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing how muscle-generated lactate fuels the liver to make blood glucose, which then cycles back to power muscle activity. Their work established the foundation for understanding how muscles use one form of lactate (L-lactate) and how the liver uses blood glucose in a tightly coordinated fuel exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian team has now shown that obese mice — and even humans with obesity — carry elevated levels of a different molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the well-studied L-lactate produced by muscles, D-lactate largely originates from gut bacteria and was found to raise blood sugar and liver fat more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blocking D-lactate with a substrate trap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop this, the researchers created a “gut substrate trap” — a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels.

&lt;p&gt;“This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we’re intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm,” says Schertzer, a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Despite the uniform appearance of pink flamingo flocks, individuals live very different lifestyles. In the Camargue region of France, some stay put for their entire lives while others migrate along the Mediterranean coast. Now, scientists believe these two groups differ in how they age, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research published Monday, August 25, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2422882122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt; found that migratory flamingoes, who leave the Camargue annually to spend the winter in Italy, Spain, or North Africa, age slower than non-migratory resident flamingoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings point to a link between migratory behavior and the rate of aging, adding a new layer of complexity to one of the most central—and perplexing—questions in biology: why do living creatures feature an expiration date? And why do these expiration dates vary so widely among different species? New research adds yet another layer of complexity to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Understanding the causes of changes in the rate of aging is a problem that has obsessed researchers and polymath philosophers since ancient times,” co-author Hugo Cayuela, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095609"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. “For a long time, we thought that these variations occurred mainly between species. But recently, our perception of the problem has changed,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Same species, different lifestyle—and lifespan&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence suggests that individuals within the same species often do not age at the same rate due to genetic, behavioral, or environmental variation, according to Cayuela. Studying these differences can help scientists unlock the secrets of aging. Thanks to their long lifespans and behavioral diversity, the Camargue’s greater flamingoes provide an ideal model for this research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cayuela and his colleagues analyzed more than 40 years of data gathered by the Tour du Valat research institute’s flamingo tagging and tracking program. These data described mortality and reproductive patterns among 1,840 migrating and non-migrating greater flamingos across the Mediterranean basin. Resident individuals exhibited lower mortality rates in early adulthood than migrating individuals, resulting in life expectancies that were 6.7 years longer on average.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Migratory greater flamingoes, however, exhibited 40% slower aging and reduced mortality later in life than residents. In fact, the findings suggest that aging begins a year and a half earlier in resident greater flamingoes than migrants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered differences in reproductive patterns between migratory and nonmigratory greater flamingoes. While residents had higher probabilities of breeding than migrants before the onset of aging, they exhibited much steeper declines in breeding with age compared to migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“While residents can reproduce more often early in life, this comes at a cost: higher mortality and reduced reproductive success later on,” co-author &lt;span tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"&gt;Jocelyn Champagnon, a research scientist at Tour du Valat, told Gizmodo in an email. “&lt;/span&gt;Migrants, on the other hand, may trade off some early reproduction for better survival later in life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Behavior shapes biology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These differences are “probably linked to a compromise between performance when young and health in old age,” co-author Sébastien Roques, a postdoctoral researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, said in the release. “Residents live intensely at first, but pay for this pace later on. Migrants, on the other hand, seem to age more slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that migrating comes with some disadvantages early in life but reduces the rate of aging and reproductive senescence—the age-related decline in an individual’s ability to reproduce—later in life. According to the researchers, this study highlights the critical role that migration plays in shaping survival and reproduction throughout life, underscoring the importance of behavioral decisions in the biology of aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that the shape and pace of aging can be shaped by individual decisions early in life, such as migration or early reproduction,” &lt;span tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"&gt;Champagnon said. Though these results can’t be directly applied to people, s&lt;/span&gt;he hopes future studies will address questions about how human migrations influence the rate of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

Chan School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. It was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial,” study first author &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/147408" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Yuxi Liu,&lt;/a&gt; a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system, and a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and Broad, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The release said Alzheimer’s has “a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.” One gene in particular is implicated: apolipoprotein E (APOE) has the strongest genetic risk for the more common type of Alzheimer’s that developed later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern, per the researchers. It has four variants and people inherit one from each of their parents. Those with one copy of the APOE4 gene variant have three to four times greater change of developing Alzheimer’s. The risk is 12-fold for those with two APOE4 copies, compared to those without that variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-Mediterranean-diet" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The Mediterranean diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is largely plant-based, with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans and legumes. Extra virgin olive oil is the main fat source. The diet can contain fish, poultry and dairy — especially fish that contain a lot of omega-3 fatty acids. Red meat and sweets are discouraged, as is butter, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The clinic’s webpage includes a Mediterranean food list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is also deemed a healthy choice for those looking to reduce their risk of coronary artery disease or other forms of heart disease. The diet has also been linked to maintaining a healthy body weight, improving the gut biome, lowering risk of certain cancers and other health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-the-study" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About the study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers looked at data from 4,215 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, average age 57 at baseline, following their data from 1989 to 2023. They also looked at similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, using data from 1993-2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;To figure out dietary patterns, they looked at food frequency questionnaires and blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. They also considered genetic risk. Participants were followed over time to see if they developed dementia and a subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The release said that those following a Mediterranean-style diet had lower risk of dementia and also slower cognitive decline. The protective effect was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 variant, “suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers note that people may not know their APOE status or whether they have the APOE4 allele, adding “more work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.” Liu said they hope to explore whether using diet or other interventions to target specific metabolites could create a more focused, personalized approach to reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among limitations, they note the study conducted in well-educated individuals of European descent, which might impact whether it can be generalized to the public at large. And dementia outcomes were “based on self-reported physician diagnoses and death records, which may introduce misclassification.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 20:43:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOSnZlRlVjSXhJOGcyRXBQU2Jyc05xQWRYcnYteDRjTGRLVGRLTklRVUFYZXZ3azVrX0JIakRQV0l3cFI3WGVQejBZVlAtb0VLTWFkNUwtcVI3UklBVEJGV0dhOXZiMUZHWElpM1daT2VPQ3FUeHh3RE1icFVGQmszdmJqM3d5OThWS0tVQ1VWQ0NIMG5TNV9Ib013UUtFUmdlRHkw</guid></item><item><title>关于肌酸的知识以及为什么军方为特种部队调节肌酸- Military.com</title><link>https://www.military.com/military-fitness/what-know-about-creatine-and-why-military-regulates-it-special-forces</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
    

    






                            &lt;p&gt;Creatine monohydrate is among the most popular and widely researched dietary supplements globally. Athletes and fitness enthusiasts, among others, use it as they seek to enhance physical performance and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its reputation is built on decades of scientific research and practical results, making it a common addition to sports nutrition routines and even daily health regimens for older adults.&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/health/creatine-and-military-training"&gt; I have seen mixed results&lt;/a&gt; when athletes undergoing rigorous &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/special-operations"&gt;special operations&lt;/a&gt;-level training take creatine. These athletes typically are still competing in high school or collegiate sports programs but attend a Special Warfare exposure weekend or screening, such as what the &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/us-naval-academy"&gt;U.S. Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; does each semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4ab3b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4ab3d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In military training like Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S),&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/health/protein-supplementation-do-you-need-it"&gt; all supplements are banned for those enrolled.&lt;/a&gt; This is largely a result of dosing and hydration needs not being fully misunderstood and cases of misuse in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Next&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/essential-swim-workout-military-special-operations-candidates"&gt;The Essential Swim Workout for Military Special Operations Candidates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw many special ops recruits who were collegiate athletes struggle with severe cramps and digestive issues. This was my first exposure to the supplement, and the performance of users was not impressive. Shortly afterward, the military banned all supplements from special ops selection programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4acb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4acb8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, creatine has made a comeback with science-backed studies showing benefits over a wide range of ages. While it remains banned from high-intensity military training programs -- and should continue to be, in my opinion -- the benefits of regular training doses have shown remarkable results for high-performing athletes and the aging population, outside of just adding bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved short-term memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced mental and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longer attention spans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science has opened my eyes to the use of creatine for many different reasons, not just larger biceps. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Creatine Monohydrate?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that can be synthesized in the body. The average adult requires 3 to 5 grams of creatine a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get creatine from dietary sources such as red meat, poultry and fish. If you are a meat eater, you can naturally increase your daily creatine intake by eating 12 ounces of steak, chicken and certain fish, which contain 2 grams, 1.5 grams and up to 5 grams of creatine, respectively. Herring contains 5 grams of creatine per 12 ounces, and salmon is comparable in calories to steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cooking meat to a well-done temperature decreases the amount of creatine consumed. If you’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246861/"&gt;vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to supplement that, but your body can still synthesize creatine (1 gram daily) with plant-based protein. Discuss with a nutritionist or health-care provider about the proper dosage, especially if you are an athlete or highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things to consider when deciding to take supplements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do they agree with your digestive system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the appropriate dosage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it a safe and reputable company that develops and distributes supplements?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side Effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of creatine can include weight gain, nausea or diarrhea, and it is not recommended for people with kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes. Severe cramping may also occur, likely ending an athlete's training day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommended Dose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A daily dose of 3 to 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is effective for most individuals. This can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. Power and strength athletes may take much larger dosages (10 to 20 grams), leading to greater effects on performance and how the body handles it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support healthy hydration and reduce the risk of cramping or discomfort. Depending on your creatine dosage, gender and size, you may need to consume 3 to 4 liters per day, which is roughly a gallon of water. If you are sweating profusely, you’ll need more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Third-Party Verification for Supplement Safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose to supplement, purchase any products from independently tested companies from organizations that test for impurities, such as the&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/who-is-nsf-international"&gt; National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://usp.jobs/about/"&gt;United States Pharmacopeia (USP)&lt;/a&gt; or the&lt;a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/"&gt; Consumer Lab.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorne is another option to consider. Thorne is a trusted brand for Olympic athletes because of its NSF-certified products. In 2016, Thorne became the first nutritional supplement company to be endorsed by the U.S. Olympic Committee for supplying U.S. national teams. However, athletes must select from Thorne's specific "Certified for Sport" line, as not all Thorne products are tested to this strict standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research and Benefits That Deserve Consideration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine has always been linked to improved&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11828245/"&gt; muscle growth, strength growth and power performance enhancements.&lt;/a&gt; With resistance training, sprinting and explosive movements, creatine can increase the body's capacity to perform these short full-effort activities. These benefits have been observed in trained athletes and recreational exercisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental performance has been linked to creatine supplementation&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39070254/"&gt; by supporting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Studies suggest users can improve short-term memory, mental fatigue and overall cognitive processing, especially in situations where the brain's energy demands are elevated, such as during periods of high stress, sleep deprivation or intense mental tasks. This supplement has been especially helpful with aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent discovery has to do with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9"&gt;mental and physical performance after poor sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Creatine supplementation may help mitigate some of the negative effects of poor sleep by supporting energy availability in the brain and muscles. While not a substitute for adequate rest, creatine may offer some resilience against the cognitive and physical declines associated with occasional inadequate sleep. For the tactical professional, this holds much promise for shift work and broken sleep periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, though, that the effectiveness of creatine may vary, depending on the intensity of training and the availability of hydration before, during and after training. In some cases, it can even be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you can take creatine as a civilian and in the military before entering military special ops service programs, I still do not recommend it. Many supplements create psychological and physiological needs through their use during strength training and muscle development, and that can be an issue in high-attrition training programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot and should not take it during actual military training programs that require long hours of intense physical activity in less than hospitable environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to Learn More About Military Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're thinking of joining the military, looking for fitness and basic training tips, or keeping up with military life and benefits, Military.com has you covered. &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/profile/member-profile-newsletter-settings.html"&gt;Subscribe to Military.com&lt;/a&gt; to have military news, updates and resources delivered directly to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
