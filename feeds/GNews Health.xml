class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s his goal to even further lessen trust in vaccines and make it onerous enough for manufacturers that they will abandon it,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, about the statements and Kennedy. “It’s a fragile market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In this same week, Kennedy extolled parents to “do their own research” in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/kennedy-vaccines-research.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;talk show interview&lt;/a&gt; – the phrase has become pop culture shorthand for a shallow internet search that casts people into the arms of the disinformation

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told the Washington Post, in response to questions about general vaccine policy and the measles vaccine. The department did not clarify what it meant by “new vaccine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The department spokesperson also described new surveillance systems for vaccines, “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits – because real science demands both transparency and accountability”, but did not elaborate on the design of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to being confirmed to the role of health secretary, Kennedy was arguably the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine advocate and led a non-profit known for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prolific misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. He also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/rfk-jr-finances.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;earned money&lt;/a&gt; by referring clients to law firms suing vaccine makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the claims Kennedy spread was that medications cause “autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years”, he said in an interview in 2021, according to reporting by the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy also claimed this week that the MMR vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decades-old sterile fetal cell lines&lt;/a&gt; derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s, including the rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vaccines against new pathogens, such as Covid-19, are placebo tested. However, experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines, for instance measles, to be unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“No institutional review board at any academic center would ever accept that – so he’s asking what personal injury lawyer invariably asks for, which is the impossible to be done,” said Offit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although Kennedy has made false and misleading statements about vaccines generally, the Covid-19 vaccine appears to be especially in the administration’s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/rfk-jr-chronic-disease-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;questions about Covid-19 strategy&lt;/a&gt; from the Guardian, the administration responded: “The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health officials have reportedly required all research grant applications on messenger RNA technology, which powers most Covid-19 vaccines, be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flagged to Kennedy’s office&lt;/a&gt;. They have also ended research that tested for the Covid-19 vaccine’s safety and efficacy in special groups, such as pregnant women, as part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$11bn clawback&lt;/a&gt; in grants from states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most controversially, the Food and Drug Administration has delayed expected approval of a new Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, reportedly on the review of a political appointee known to be skeptical of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the weekend, FDA commissioner Marty Makary addressed the delay by describing annual updates to the vaccine’s strains as a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/27/fda-covid-vaccine-approval-process-novavax-pfizer-moderna/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“new” product&lt;/a&gt;, creating confusion about whether vaccine makers have to conduct new safety and efficacy trials. Such trials would not be a normal part of routine updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; that said in part the FDA had demanded a clinical trial as part of post-approval surveillance, and that it would continue to work with the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxObDZOYUotSWVydXpzdmpWRUtCcVFaRFQtc0J2c3JsUlJmU0tiaVc0NHc3dTJYWlg4N2xHZW1lakFha25wSEJGVHRTcl9vTVdoelJydC05ajVxTFJZM1BfRHp5QkRGLXlSYWNQQTJwbTg3d1ZIVzdiNFphZlVrYkFfZFRB</guid></item><item><title>坏人会来吗？研究发现大多数业力信徒都这么认为- CNN | Do bad people have it coming?

            When it comes to karma, most people believe the universe is their own personal cheerleader — but an exacting judge for everyone else, according to a new study published May 1 by the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rel-rel0000565.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00023j6npdqjy3qg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers asked more than 2,000 people from various &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/health/francis-collins-faith-science-public-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; and nonreligious backgrounds to write about their experiences with karma — the belief that good deeds are rewarded, and bad actions are punished — and a common through-line of their responses emerged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00033j6n6bwa318q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the participants wrote about themselves, 59% told tales of being rewarded for their good deeds. In their stories about others, 92% chronicled how misfortune befell cheating partners, indebted friends, bullies and lousy coworkers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00043j6n2n0d7pfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Thinking about karma allows people to take personal credit and feel pride in good things that happen to them even when it isn’t clear exactly what they did to create the good outcome,” the study’s senior author, Cindel White, said in a statement. “But it also allows people to see other people’s suffering as justified retribution.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00053j6ni5ppszpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings offer a window into the way our minds form judgments about ourselves and those around us, said White, an assistant professor at York University in Toronto who studies how psychological motives interact with spirituality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00063j6ne6k5st9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I firmly believe in providing charitable donations to those in need, no matter how small,” one anonymous response from the study reads. “Doing so has benefited me greatly and occasionally has led to individuals doing me favors without asking.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00073j6ndp1frl71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another reads, “I knew a guy who was always rude and cruel to everyone; he never did anything nice his entire life. He was diagnosed with cancer, and I just couldn’t help but think that was karma.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x00083j6nes8lpjpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study identifies the tendency to see yourself as deserving of good fortune, even in the absence of direct causes, as a form of “attribution bias,” — a concept which has been studied by psychologists for decades, said Patrick Heck, a research psychologist at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, commenting in his personal capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x00093j6nawcwukih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attribution theory and attribution biases are the general idea that people attribute certain things that happen to them or other people in line with ways that make them feel good about themselves,” said Heck, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000a3j6ncwtktlap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some ways, attribution bias serves the purpose of promoting self-esteem, which helps people overcome challenges in life, White said. But other times, it could lead people astray when they fail to recognize the contributions of others or the external factors of success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000b3j6nzuvul9o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the other side of the coin, the belief that other people’s suffering is a form of punishment comes from a need to believe that the world is just. This belief can help people make sense of the complexity of life, Heck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000c3j6ne2tzclw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(The world) is full of statistical noise. Random things happen to people all the time. And we know from lots of research in psychology that people struggle to reconcile randomness in their lives,” Heck said. “It’s very compelling to want to have a story or an explanation for why good things happen to some people and why bad things happen to other people. … I think karma is a really nicely packaged way that maybe has found its way into religion and other belief systems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000d3j6n4mas26ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of karma originates from Asian religious traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, and many variations exist in how it’s practiced between different groups, White said. For this reason, the study sampled participants from the United States, Singapore and India to get a broad range of cultural and religious backgrounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000e3j6nxs6p3ygt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Notably, results skewed slightly differently between Western and non-Western respondents, with Indian and Singaporean participants showing less self-enhancing bias — a finding that is consistent with &lt;a href="https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/WhiteNorenzayanSchaller-PSPB%202018.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000f3j6nbqiz35hw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We found very similar patterns across multiple cultural contexts, including Western samples, where we know people often think about themselves in exaggeratedly positive ways, and samples from Asian countries where people are more likely to be self-critical,” White said. “But across all countries, participants were much more likely to say that other people face karmic punishments while they receive karmic rewards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000g3j6n2cialb2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            White said her future research will explore how these beliefs around karma affect decision-making.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000h3j6nd3ihk242@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s sometimes differences between your religious beliefs, what people actually think about in everyday life, and then how they act,” White said. “There could be other situations where they are prompted by the experience itself, and they’re going to think about karma in a very different way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000i3j6nrxshljs1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, belief-driven biases can have broad, real-world implications, especially when it comes to policymaking and our justice system, Heck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000j3j6nlf56pj3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, social prejudices such as racism and classism function on the premise that an “inferior” group earned its status by behaving in a way that is socially unacceptable, said Yudit Jung, an adjunct associate professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. Such views can then inform people’s treatment of those groups and their willingness to offer help.

            Ultimately, Jung, who is also a practicing psychoanalyst, said she believes the studied biases are common to most people. They can be a form of defense, originating from early childhood experiences and the need to feel secure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I work with patients a lot on (developing) compassion and a sense of shared humanity, recognizing that we are all a mixture of good and bad,” Jung said. “It’s not about influencing religion. It’s about a patient’s basic ethics.”

Red meat comes from non-fowl mammals (a.k.a. animals that aren’t birds). Beef, pork, lamb, venison, and boar are examples of red meat. Chicken and turkey, on the other hand, are white meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, red meat &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015455/#:~:text=Red%20meat%20is%20a%20nutrient%20dense%20food%20that%20is%20an,B12%20in%20the%20diet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains key nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;contains key nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like protein, vitamin B12, and zinc. Its major flex? Red meat is a top source of heme iron—the kind most readily absorbed by your body, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation/iron-rich-foods.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Red Cross;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—though you can also find heme iron in chicken and turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But be warned: With the buzz around protein online, the pros of red meat might be getting overstated, especially at the expense of the cons.

Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can help keep you full.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some content creators swear by red meat for its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40steakandbuttergal%2Fvideo%2F7482085354737028395&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:satiating power;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;satiating power&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the science backs that up. Red meat is loaded with protein that keeps hunger at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein naturally boosts satiety,” says Kim Johnson, RD, the founder of Nourish/d Wellness. “It keeps you fuller, longer.” That’s partly because it takes more time and energy for your body to break it down, she says. (BTW, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19993913/protein-breakfast-ideas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein in general has this effect;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;in general&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; has this effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so white meat options like chicken should also keep you feeling satiated.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Johnson recommends enjoying red meat earlier in the day, ideally a couple of hours before bed, to give your body time to digest. But here’s the kicker: it’s not just the meat that keeps you full—it’s eating adequate calories that helps you feel truly satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It supports muscle growth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to build strength and support lean muscle, red meat might just deserve a spot on your plate. It’s a complete protein source, meaning it packs all nine essential amino acids your body needs for muscle repair and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it contains &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64174301/how-much-creatine-should-i-take/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creatine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;creatine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—which has &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a44716483/creatine-for-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:legit benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;legit benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to strength and performance—along with B vitamins that help convert food into energy and keep your muscles functioning at their best. You’ll also get a healthy dose of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g19967379/signs-youre-not-getting-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;zinc&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a key player in muscle recovery and overall health, per a 2020 study in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720301312" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Redox Biology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Redox Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And, you’ll get some iron, which supports muscle growth and function, per a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcsm.13277" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s the most bioavailable source of heme iron.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some women intentionally include red meat &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40catherineirvin%3Fis_from_webapp%3D1%26sender_device%3Dpc&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during their follicular phase;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;during their follicular phase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help replenish iron levels—and there might be something behind the strategy. Red meat is a top-tier source of iron, a nutrient many &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62514296/weird-signs-of-iron-deficiency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women tend to fall short on;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women tend to fall short on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially during menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s not just iron. Red meat is rich in zinc and B vitamins, all of which are essential for hormone health and energy, according to Johnson. “If you find yourself seriously craving meat, it might be your body’s way of signaling a need for more iron, protein, or zinc,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no science specifically citing red meat consumption to be beneficial during a woman’s cycle, however, and you can also get these nutrients from other sources like poultry, seafood, shellfish, and plant-based options, says Anjali Prasertong, MPH, RD, the writer of the weekly newsletter Antiracist Dietitian. And it’s not like red meat is the end all be all of a healthy period. “Hormonal health is best supported by consistent and sustainable nutritional variety, stress management, and avoiding restrictive eating,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s tasty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in case you wondered, yes! That’s a good enough reason to add it to your plate. There's no point in eating in a way that's “unsustainable and virtually joyless,” says Abby Langer, RD, the founder of Abby Langer Nutrition and author of &lt;em&gt;Good Food, Bad Diet&lt;/em&gt;. So, if you want to eat red meat because it’s tasty—there’s benefit in that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, some of the potential risks of red meat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It may increase your risk of heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest cons of eating red meat is its potential to harm &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64343593/dhrps-heart-health-measurement-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. Processed and non-processed red meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64619518/walking-activity-quick-bursts-heart-disease-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women, according to a 2023 systematic review in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/44/28/2626/7188739" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European Heart Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the high saturated fat content in red meat can cause cholesterol levels to rise, says Johnson. Compared to white meat, red meat usually has more saturated fat—and processed meats have even more than unprocessed cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends that just six percent of your total daily calories come from saturated fat. That means if you’re consuming 2,000 calories, only 120 of them should be from saturated fats, which shakes out to about 13 grams.

Red meat and processed meat increase colorectal cancer risk by 30 and 40 percent, respectively, according to a 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38112776/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to learn more about how exactly red and processed meats are linked with cancer, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00444-1/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:classifies processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;classifies processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the highest level), meaning there is sufficient evidence that it causes cancer in humans. Red meat is group 2, which makes it a probable carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, it’s not just &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a36366953/color-cancer-symptoms-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

Additionally, several large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8118195/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NIH studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also demonstrated an association between the consumption of heme iron and the development of colorectal cancer and breast cancer in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s linked to type-2 diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat, especially the processed kind (think: hot dogs and deli meats), has been linked to a higher risk of type-2 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, per a 2024 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00179-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The number is steep, according to the research. Participants in a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)66119-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who consumed the most red and processed meat had a 64 percent higher risk of developing type-2 diabetes compared to those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side: swapping red meat for more plant-based foods—like beans, nuts, and whole grains—can lower the risk of both heart disease and diabetes, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03093-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMC Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between red meat and type-2 diabetes comes down to three factors, based on the studies above: saturated fat, heme iron, and inflammatory compounds—all of which can mess with the way your body uses insulin and even damage the cells to produce it, which can lead to type-2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed red meats may increase dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat might also mess with your brain health. Eating processed red meats like bacon, sausages, and salami increases dementia risk by 13 percent, according to a 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210286" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just one fourth of a serving per day increased the risk, compared to those who ate processed meat less frequently. One serving of unprocessed red meat also saw a 16 percent increased risk of self-reported cognitive decline, per the same study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how much red meat should we be eating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are risks associated with red meat, you don’t need to avoid that section of the grocery store entirely. “We don't have to just completely give up red meat,” says Johnson. “It’s all about what kind, how much, and how often.” Red meat can fit into a balanced diet, she says, and she recommends eating red meat once or twice a week in three to four ounce portions (even less frequently than the &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/recommendations/limit-consumption-of-red-and-processed-meat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AIRC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIRC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests women cap their red meat consumption at 12 to 18 cooked ounces per week) and minimizing processed meats as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the claims and diets promoting more frequent consumption might not be backed by experts or science. “I wouldn't recommend it every day,” says Langer. “But once or twice a week, in a moderate amount, is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that people online are advocating consuming more red meat, it’s also that they’re eating mostly—or only—red meat. “I'm not against red meat, I’m just against a diet being predominantly one food group,” Langer says. “A variety of food means that we're getting a variety of nutrients.” When it comes to all-meat diets, you're losing out on a lot of the protective nutrients, like high fiber carbs, non-starchy vegetables, antioxidants, and micronutrients, Johnson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanket statements from red-meat promoters online like “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40steakandbuttergal%2Fvideo%2F7484372490421046574%3F_r%3D1%26_t%3DZT-8vlFPWZF5RL&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I thrive without fiber;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;I thrive without fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40catherineirvin%2Fvideo%2F7494016997382950175&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I'm a daily ground beef girl;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;I'm a daily ground beef girl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” may work for social media, but maybe not so much for people's real lives, Prasertong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Find The Healthiest Red Meat Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all red meat is created equal. Processed meats carry some of the highest risks (according to the research above), and you’ll also want to put some consideration into the fat content of your red meat and how it was raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to enjoy beef, try choosing lean cuts like sirloin or tenderloin to avoid going overboard on calories or saturated fat, says Johnson. When it comes to ground meat, check the label for cuts that are at least 90 percent to keep saturated fat lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our experts say there are some benefits to grass fed cuts, but you don’t need to break the bank for them. “Grass-fed beef does have a better omega-3 profile compared to conventional beef, but it's not going to be your main source of omega-3, so just kind of think of that as a nutritional bonus, and not a substitute for something like salmon,” says Johnson. “The real benefit is overall quality and how the animal was raised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Cut Back On Red Meat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide Your Plate Into Sections:&lt;/strong&gt; Build your plate around plants instead of making meat “the main event of the meal,” says Johnson. Half of your plate should be non-starchy vegetables, like spinach salad, asparagus, and mixed vegetables. Then, one forth of your plate can be protein, like chicken, fish, or steak. The remaining one fourth of your plate can be high-fiber carbs like sweet potatoes, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Your Portion In Half:&lt;/strong&gt; “Cut your red meat portions in half and replace that half with a non-heme plant,” says Johnson. For example, if you are using ground beef for taco night, you could use half of your ground beef and use black beans or lentils as the other half. This would decrease your red meat intake while adding other nutrients like fiber to your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap Your Red Meat For Something Leaner:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of using red meat, swap it for a leaner source of protein, like chicken, turkey, fish, or shellfish, says Johnson. For example, ground beef can be swapped for ground turkey to make turkey burgers, or chili and ground chicken can be made into meatballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick A Few Meals A Week That Are Plant-Based: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re transitioning toward a plant-based diet, Langer recommends aiming for at least two to three meatless meals per week. Try using tofu, beans, lentils, and tempeh as a main protein source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cutting back on meat, it’s important to know how to get the most out of your non-heme iron sources like lentils, chickpeas, tofu, spinach, and quinoa. “Pair them with vitamin C-rich foods to help your body absorb the iron more effectively,” Johnson says. Think: lentils with bell peppers, chickpeas with tomatoes, or a spinach and berry smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 12:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9JdXFWd3lfNHVVdjEwbnhCT1V4ZkEzOEsxaWFQLVF5WjhhVVFyMEhIak96RDk4MUpBS2hBZjVMaFJRZ3NDU011ZVJMWGwyUE50b2VxOUlBZEVkdW1uVjRhNGpZTDhTMF9EV3lj</guid></item><item><title>麻疹在加拿大、墨西哥和美国爆发，跨越北美边境-美联社新闻 | Measles jumps borders in North America with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and US - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPS2dDdXhZeFVEUWtNTHhKbjFXYlQ0ZEU3bVFrTkNERnBlcFJXdXBaNjEyaE92R2dLYWxfVmhLV3pwbXN3a0pOREtndGRfUlhqS1JaRWpZZEVIUTRfNDg4RWhseFFkTm5UMjJ5QW0xZWYtdWZHR3p6SWdWM2hkN2ZfVTFzS3VFQTlyc19VMnJIZlMzYnluUUlzNUx2WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPS2dDdXhZeFVEUWtNTHhKbjFXYlQ0ZEU3bVFrTkNERnBlcFJXdXBaNjEyaE92R2dLYWxfVmhLV3pwbXN3a0pOREtndGRfUlhqS1JaRWpZZEVIUTRfNDg4RWhseFFkTm5UMjJ5QW0xZWYtdWZHR3p6SWdWM2hkN2ZfVTFzS3VFQTlyc19VMnJIZlMzYnluUUlzNUx2WQ</guid></item><item><title>顶级营养师经常食用5种高蛋白、高纤维食物，而不是肉类，以改善肠道健康- Business Insider | 5 high-protein, high-fiber foods a top nutritionist eats regularly instead of meat for better gut health - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNSUJqbjY5OFVPUEt4bDhwQ29fVm5WWjhXSGZEUzJ0bUtNQ0FwRTM5Q3ZjOE8tOS1WY0hHdWtLMllBOWpzT3N4U01xR2psUHNSejlYWHFxTWdKMHlDZEhWdW42QnhmMkIwQlV3c0p2WWYydS1NcmlRcHgzbGlRaDdrTE5NU1k3TkJwNHFRRzhKZi0wZHZSOUMtN0k1dGotWXdJVWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story"&gt;
            
              &lt;p&gt;You don't need to be scoffing steaks or gorging on protein shakes to get enough of the macronutrient — a top nutritionist says &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-nutritious-plant-based-proteins-soy-seitan-pulses-2021-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; is the best kind, and better for your gut health than meat, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federica Amati, Ph.D., is the lead nutritionist at ZOE, a science and nutrition company, and a postdoctoral medical scientist at Imperial College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-protein-foods-rule-easy-fat-loss-lose-pounds-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Hitting protein targets&lt;/a&gt; is currently a huge health trend. But Amati told Business Insider that most people get enough, and don't need to worry about eating more protein unless they're an athlete or actively trying to change their body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; people get their protein from matters, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati referred to a 2024 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition involving 50,000 healthy nurses aged 30-55 at the start of the study, between 1984 and 2016. The nurses who ate more protein, and specifically &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eat-more-protein-boost-gut-health-same-time-easy-doctor-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt;, had a higher chance of being free from 11 major chronic diseases, having good mental health, and not having cognitive or physical impairments as they aged. Meanwhile, participants who ate more animal protein had an increased risk of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is echoed in a 2021 study by researchers at the University of Oxford, published in the journal BMC Medicine. The 474,985 middle-aged British participants who ate more red and processed meat were more likely to develop heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, and growths in the colon. Participants who ate more poultry were at higher risk of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati said the results of the 2024 study suggested that the health benefits came from eating more fruit, vegetable, and whole foods, not protein. The researchers argued this could be because the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt;, micronutrients, and polyphenols in plant foods are associated with positive health effects, including reduced low-density lipoprotein, or "bad," cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and decreased inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Amati still has animal-based proteins: She eats oily fish twice a week, and eggs and fermented dairy — kefir and Greek yogurt specifically — regularly. But most of her protein comes from plants, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't go fully plant-based, research suggests it's possible to make a "huge" reduction in your chronic disease risk by replacing some animal protein with plants, Amati said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shared some of the best sources of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;high-fiber plant protein&lt;/a&gt; that she eats regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1b82631c-db68-416f-9860-0e05347d85d9" data-toc-id="1b82631c-db68-416f-9860-0e05347d85d9"&gt;Nutritional yeast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/nutritional-yeast" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Nutritional yeast&lt;/a&gt;, or "nooch," is deactivated yeast that has a cheesy flavor and contains B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a nice example of a food that has both protein and fiber," Amati said. In terms of nutritional value, 100 grams of nooch contains about 50 grams of protein and about 20 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mediterranean-diet-chef-adds-plant-based-protein-to-meals-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;dietitian who follows the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; previously told BI she incorporates nooch into her diet by sprinkling it on savory dishes as a cheese replacement.

For example, there are about 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber in 100 grams of edamame beans, and around 20 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber in 100 grams of tempeh.

            &lt;p&gt;A 2020 study looking at 210,000 people, published in Circulation, an American Heart Association journal,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;found that participants who ate at least one serving of tofu a week had a lower risk of heart disease than those who ate it less than once a month. The researchers suggested that this may have been because the estrogen-like compounds in tofu could have led to effects that mirror the beneficial effects of estrogen in women who weren't taking supplemental hormones — or because the fiber and minerals found in tofu help to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3d5bd72e-b8c9-46b9-80cf-14521279c859" data-toc-id="3d5bd72e-b8c9-46b9-80cf-14521279c859"&gt;Oats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati often eats oatmeal or &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trying-ree-drummond-easy-overnight-oats-recipe" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;overnight oats&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, adding kefir, chia seeds, and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

It also, unfortunately, means ticks â€” including those that play host to bacteria that cause Lyme disease,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most common tick-borne illness in the US. The bacteria, which larval ticks pick up when they feed on infected rodents, can cause headache, joint pain, a telltale bullseye rash, and more serious symptoms in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Lyme-transmitting ticks, known as black-legged or deer ticks, were once largely balkanized to coastal New England. (The disease is named for a Connecticut town where researchers in the 1970s first described it, although &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/ancient-history-of-lyme-disease-in-north-america-revealed-with-bacterial-genomes/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;it has existed for millennia&lt;/a&gt;.) But in recent decades, the ticksâ€™ range has expanded. Lyme is now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/lyme-disease-case-map.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;pervasive in the northeastern US&lt;/a&gt;, with large numbers of cases detected as far west as Minnesota and as far south as Virginia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Todayâ€™s newsletter explains why ticks have become more widespread â€” and how to keep them from crawling all over you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Two factors have combined to produce ideal conditions for more Lyme-causing ticks to come into contact with more humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One is global warming. Climate change has kept the Northeast hotter and more humid for longer on average, stretching the ticksâ€™ active season from early spring into the late summer or early fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhen I was starting to work on this back in the 1970s, 1980s, we really didnâ€™t see new cases until May,â€� said Dr. Allen Steere, a rheumatologist at Harvard Medical School who was among &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/08/22/lyme-disease-how-discovered-and-where-from-here/KVovTbvJsJ8HIhx4K7yYQI/story.html?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/08/22/lyme-disease-how-discovered-and-where-from-here/KVovTbvJsJ8HIhx4K7yYQI/story.html?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;the first researchers to study Lyme&lt;/a&gt;. Today, infections in the northeast typically start rising in March. Adi Shah, who treats patients with severe Lyme at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, told me heâ€™s seen cases in November or December.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The deer tickâ€™s moniker suggests the second factor behind its proliferation. Less hunting and fewer natural predators have caused New Englandâ€™s population of white-tailed deer â€” on whose backs the ticks breed â€” &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/27/data/massachusetts-deer-population/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/27/data/massachusetts-deer-population/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter "&gt;to skyrocket&lt;/a&gt;. â€œEvery deer represents, basically, a dating site,â€� said Stephen Rich, a microbiologist at UMass Amherst. One deer can feed up to a thousand ticks, each of which can lay up to 4,000 eggs, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Suburban sprawl, lawns that abut woods, and gardens with plants that deer see as tasty snacks have also invited more of them into spaces that humans frequent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thereâ€™s one surefire way to avoid getting Lyme: â€œDonâ€™t get bitten,â€� says Thomas Mather, a University of Rhode Island tick expert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Chemicals can lessen the chances. Rich, the UMass microbiologist, suggests getting your property treated with &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/prevention/protect-your-yard/perimeter-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/prevention/protect-your-yard/perimeter-treatments/"&gt;bifenthrin, an insecticide&lt;/a&gt;. If you live in a tick-infested area, Mather says, spray your clothes and shoes with permethrin, another chemical, once a month. If youâ€˜re traveling to a Lyme hotspot, apply a repellant like DEET every few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are sartorial solutions, too. If hiking, wear long pants and sleeves, tuck in your shirt, and tuck your pants inside your socks. Tight-fitting clothes, like leggings, offer ticks fewer points of entry. Shower after you come inside and do a tick check. â€œThey tend to get in the areas where your body forms a Y,â€� Rich said, like leg and arm joints.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And donâ€™t forget about your pets! Ticks like to burrow behind dogsâ€™ and catsâ€™ ears and beneath their collars. If yours spend time outside, check them regularly and keep them up to date with flea and tick prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Suppose you spot a tick on you. What then? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finding one crawling on you may be creepy, but good news: it probably hasnâ€™t bitten you yet. If it has, use tweezers to grasp the tick close to your skin &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html"&gt;and pull it away gently&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid getting its mouthparts stuck in you. (Gross, I know.) Be careful not to squeeze its body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Different tick species carry different types of bacteria and viruses, so the next step if youâ€˜ve been bitten is to figure out what youâ€˜re dealing with. Consult &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/in-depth/tick-species/art-20546861" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;this visual guide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/tickspotters/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;send a photo to TickSpotters&lt;/a&gt;, Matherâ€™s program at URI, which will identify the tick for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;How long the tick has been there also matters. Ticks swell as they feed on your blood, so if you suspect it has, consider sending it to a lab &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/testing/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;that can test it for germs&lt;/a&gt;. Just put the pest into a sealed zip-lock bag and overnight it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the northeast, about half of adult deer ticks carry germs that cause Lyme disease, so if you pull one of those off you, thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€˜ve been exposed. Many cases of Lyme are mild and resolve quickly with the antibiotic doxycycline. But others can cause lasting fatigue, brain fog, or even brain inflammation and heart problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Lyme can be hard to diagnose, and some patients experience &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/28/magazine/i-was-convinced-i-didnt-have-lyme-disease-guess-what/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/28/magazine/i-was-convinced-i-didnt-have-lyme-disease-guess-what/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter "&gt;a dizzying array of symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. â€œIt is not a well understood phenomenon, and itâ€™s also quite difficult to treat effectively,â€� Steere, of Harvard, said of such cases. A blood test can determine whether you have antibodies that indicate an infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of course, the best peace of mind comes from not getting bitten at all. â€œI know patients who get Lyme disease and it is very debilitating,â€� said Shah, of the Mayo Clinic. â€œIt does take you out of commission.â€�&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ðŸ§© 1 Down: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/games/mini-crossword/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Pointers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;| â˜€ï¸� 58Âº &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/30/metro/boston-new-england-forecast/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;A cooler note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other key lifestyle changes include quitting smoking, cutting back on alcohol, and regular cholesterol checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also important to exercise more to help lower cholesterol levels; the health body advises everybody to do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could be broken down into daily brisk walks, cycling, or swimming – any movement that feels like a workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Try a few different exercises to find something you like doing," the NHS says.

I was told painful periods were normal and I would grow out of it, but it continued to get worse the older I got."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Bulloch said she eventually found herself "struggling with basic bodily functions".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Going to the toilet was difficult. I wasn't able to go out without knowing where the toilets would be. The pain was excruciating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Bulloch's endometriosis eventually affected her bowel, appendix and left ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After undergoing the robotic surgery at Leeds Teaching Hospitals, she said she was much better and she believed her fertility should be unaffected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Listen to your body'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust has just been awarded provisional status as an accredited endometriosis treatment centre by the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Tibbott said the use of the robotic operating theatre was enabling more patients such as Stacey and Ms Bulloch to be treated - and they were recovering more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In fact, he said, he was recently able to perform surgery on six patients in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Stacey and Ms Bulloch both recently met each other for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They said they were doing well and although there was currently no cure for endometriosis, they hoped theirs would be well managed in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Stacey said her priority was now to keep her remaining kidney healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said any woman who was worried about endometriosis should take action as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Don't ignore it.

He joined a high-end longevity clinic for a few hundred dollars a month and began monitoring his blood panels, eating better and improving his sleep. He wanted to stay active as he aged — playing tennis, surfing, hiking and spending time with his young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But during Mr. Provissiero’s annual physical at the longevity clinic, his physician, Dr. Darshan Shah, gave him a sobering warning. Despite his healthy habits, Mr. Provissiero’s blood sugar was nearing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/well/blood-sugar-levels-diabetes.html" title=""&gt;prediabetic levels&lt;/a&gt;. A family history heightened his risk of developing diabetes, which can shave years off a person’s life expectancy. When a stricter diet and exercise regimen didn’t move the needle, Dr. Shah prescribed metformin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have known for decades that metformin lowers blood sugar. It’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes and is also commonly prescribed for weight loss and polycystic ovary syndrome. But some doctors, including Mr. Provissiero’s, are betting this same drug can head off a number of chronic diseases before they even develop, to help otherwise healthy people live longer and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The hope is that this is going to lead to a greater number of healthy years,” said Mr. Provissiero, who lives in Malibu, Calif. After one year on metformin, he said he feels less bloated, more energetic and more in control of his weight and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on metformin’s impact on the human life span is scant. The existing research, much of which has been done on mice, is “all over the place,” showing varying effects based on the animals’ sex and species, said Rafael de Cabo, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Aging who has studied metformin in mice for over two decades. Human studies, which have largely focused on diabetes patients, turn up conflicting findings on metformin’s benefits for healthy people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, interest in metformin’s anti-aging potential has remained high as scientists find early but promising evidence that it could also manage or delay other conditions like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(19)31471-8/abstract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-022-04649-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. “Metformin may be targeting the root cause” of several other diseases whose risks increase with age, potentially because it regulates hormones, repairs tissues and eases immune system inflammation, Dr. de Cabo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinks we’ve heard are bad for blood sugar may actually be helpful, say dietitians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include unsweetened coffee and tea, milk, juice and soy milk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, try to avoid sugary drinks like soda, sweet tea and syrupy lattes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re trying to manage your blood sugar, finding a drink that won’t spike your numbers can seem like a challenge. But what if we told you there are beverages you may be avoiding that are compatible with—and even advantageous for—blood sugar management? It’s true! Many of the drinks we’re often told are bad for blood sugar contain compounds that may support healthy blood sugar levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, there are some drinks that really are problematic for blood sugar. To set the record straight, we asked dietitians to weigh in on drinks that get an unfair rap for blood sugar management, plus ones to avoid. Here’s what they told us. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037224/drinking-coffee-inflammation-diabetes-risk-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; fans, we’ve got good news! “Coffee without added sweetener may actually be beneficial to blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="http://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;2 Day Diabetes Diet.&lt;/em&gt; “Drinking black coffee has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a slowed progression of the disease.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Palinski-Wade points to the presence of chlorogenic acids in coffee. These compounds function as antioxidants that may reduce inflammation. That’s important because unchecked inflammation can make it harder for your body to use its own insulin, impairing glucose metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And it doesn’t matter if you prefer full-test or decaf; both kinds of coffee contain chlorogenic acid. The most important thing is to make sure your coffee is unsweetened to avoid added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-dairy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Dairy Milk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy milk gets an unfair reputation in so many ways. Perhaps you’ve heard it promotes inflammation or that its sugars can raise blood sugar. You can relax, says Palinski-Wade. “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dairy milk&lt;/a&gt; often is looked at as being bad for blood sugar due to the natural sugar (lactose) it contains,” she says. “However, this drink is balanced with protein, carbs and fats, allowing it to have a minimal impact on blood sugar.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, some research has found a correlation between increased dairy intake and a &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The exact reason isn’t known, says Palinski-Wade. “However, it may be due to beneficial nutrients, including vitamin D and magnesium found in dairy, which can help to improve insulin sensitivity.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-100-fruit-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. 100% Fruit Juice  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “100% fruit juice can be part of a diabetes meal plan and keep blood sugar balanced,” says Palinski-Wade. Trouble is, the natural sugar in juice frequently causes people to avoid it, even though natural sugar is very different from added sugar. How so? “Natural sugars—unlike added sugar—are generally bound in a matrix of fiber, antioxidants and other beneficial nutrients that can help blood sugar, not hurt it,” says Palinski-Wade.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re skeptical, consider the results of a recent study that found that moderate fruit juice consumption doesn’t increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or negatively impact blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to fruit juice’s impressive nutrition and antioxidant profile, it has a lower glycemic index than sugar-sweetened beverages. So, it’s unlikely to flood your bloodstream with sugar the same way as soda or sweet tea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Juice can be enjoyed alone or used in recipes as a natural way to sweeten your dish,” says Palinski-Wade. “I recommend looking for juice that contains fiber naturally, such as 100% prune juice, and keeping your portion size to a half-cup at a time for blood sugar balance.” Or, pair it with a source of protein to slow the absorption of its sugars, like a handful of nuts or slice of cheese, says &lt;a href="http://www.samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and wellness expert and co-author of &lt;em&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-soy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Soy Milk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a lot of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-soy-you-need-to-stop-believing-11706042" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; unfounded myths about soy&lt;/a&gt;. One that you might have heard is that soy milk raises blood sugar. Is it true?  “Unsweetened soy milk is one of my go-to plant-based milks because it matches the protein in dairy milk,” says Cassetty. It’s also low in carbs, making it a healthy option when you’re managing your blood sugar, she says. In fact, 1 cup of unsweetened soy milk provides 8 grams of protein, just like dairy milk, and roughly 9 grams of carbohydrates, depending on the brand.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, soy milk’s protein can further slow down the impact of other carbs in your meal or snack. “So, if you’re having a bowl of cereal or oatmeal, serving it with soy milk can help stabilize your blood sugar,” says Cassetty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, looking for a variety with no added sugars is key, she adds. “Sometimes plain versions contain a small amount of sweetener, so you need to read labels until you find a brand that doesn’t,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-tea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Tea  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember how coffee’s chlorogenic acids do good things for blood sugar? Turns out, tea boasts its own blood sugar–friendly compounds called catechins. Research has found that catechins from both green and black tea may regulate blood sugar in multiple ways, such as improving the body’s ability to use insulin, guarding against &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and functioning as antioxidants to combat oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They may also feed your good gut bacteria, which may help your body’s insulin work more effectively to clear sugar from your blood,” says Cassetty. No wonder tea is among our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-drinks-for-diabetes-8667246" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;top antioxidant-rich drinks for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, when it comes to reaping tea’s benefits, the less you add, the better, says Cassetty. “Try to drink tea plain without any sweetener, whether that’s sugar or a zero-calorie sweetener,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-select-blood-sugarfriendly-beverages"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Select Blood Sugar–Friendly Beverages &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even healthy drinks can raise blood glucose if they contain added sugar. In addition to searching the Nutrition Facts panel for added sugars, try these strategies:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrain Your Taste Buds. &lt;/strong&gt;If your favorite beverages contain added sugars, Cassetty recommends slowly weaning yourself off them. “The real key is to get your taste buds used to drinking plain, unsweetened drinks with no added sugar and no other sweeteners,” she says. (More on this next!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap Part of Your Sugary Drink with an Unsweetened Version. &lt;/strong&gt;This works for tea, coffee, and plant-based and flavored milks. Start with a ratio of 75% sweetened to 25% unsweetened. Then, keep adjusting until you’re favoring the unsweetened. Over time, you may not need the sweetened at all!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downsize. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re not quite ready to say goodbye to your sugar-sweetened coffee or tea habit, switch to a smaller cup. It’s a small change that can help until you’re ready to make the move to unsweetened versions.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the Caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people can experience an increase in blood sugar levels when they consume large amounts of caffeine. If you notice that caffeine makes your numbers spike, switch to decaf or a half-caf blend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to what to drink for better blood sugar, there’s a lot of confusion and misinformation! The truth is, many drinks you might have heard are bad for your blood sugar (and that you may be avoiding!) may help with blood sugar management. According to dietitians, unsweetened coffee and tea, dairy milk, 100% fruit juice and soy milk can all be part of a blood sugar–friendly diet. Ideally, the goal is to aim for drinks that are free of added sugars. However, if you’re not ready to say goodbye to sugar entirely, think baby steps. By slowly weaning yourself off of sugar-sweetened drinks, you can retrain your taste buds over time.&lt;br&gt;

has a dark secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The community of just over 15,000 residents has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14647121/subtle-clue-EYE-dementia-45-retinal-thinning.html"&gt;one of the highest dementia rates&lt;/a&gt; in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in four people here over the age of 65 have it compared to around one in 10 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And that is probably only the 'tip of the iceberg', according to Dr Gladys Maestre, director  of a dedicated dementia and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14635517/virus-herpes-shingles-SEVEN-TIMES-early-dementia.html"&gt;Alzheimer's research program&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Daily Mail the number of sufferers is likely 'much, much higher', as many people don't have health insurance and cases therefore go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents in the city and the surrounding Starr County area say that almost everyone has someone in their family impacted by the condition, which causes loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maestre: 'Access to health is difficult in the area, so I believe we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. I have also seen so many people aged around 50 already sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only way to give accurate estimations is by doing an epidemiological study, door by door in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it might appear a sleepy border town with an interesting history, Rio Grande City in southern Texas has a dark secret. The low laying community of just over 15,000 residents has one of the highest dementia rates in America, at around 25 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asked what is behind the staggering number of dementia patients in Starr County, Dr Maestre says poverty is one big factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The region has a poverty rate of around 30 percent, which is more than double the national average of just under 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe lower wages and disadvantaged neighborhoods can put people at a greater risk of dementia due to various factors including poorer air quality, a greater reliance on cars or bus transportation over walking, fewer social interactions and more stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Maestre says she believes that pollutants in the area are another big contributor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She identifies a handful of toxins that have been found in the water supply and in the town's old houses, many of which date back to the early and mid 19th century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include arsenic which has been linked to reduced memory and intellectual abilities in children and adolescents, and cadmium, which is a carcinogen released into the environment through industrial and agricultural activities, known for contributing to the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another factor Dr Maestre highlights is the extreme heat in south Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research has indicated a link between extreme heat and an increased risk of dementia-related deaths and hospitalizations, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study of over three million Medicare patients in New England found that temperature increases of 1.5C (34.7F) led to a 12 per cent rise in hospital admissions for dementia sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation explains that heat can trigger dementia because 'prolonged exposure to the hot summer sun can place too much stress on the body, which negatively impacts cognitive function.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr James Falcon has been working with his physician father Antonio to lead more research into the problems plaguing Starr County&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Earlier this month it emerged that the remains of an 84-year-old Maria Soprano had been found in the city of Roma in Starr County after her family reported her missing. Authorities confirmed that she suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Starr County, temperatures range from an average minimum of 44F in January to an average maximum of 99F in July, while the average annual temperature is 74F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is another factor creating a 'perfect storm' for dementia, says the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The region is also heavily Hispanic and this demographic group is 1.5 times more likely to be affected by dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact reasons for this disparity are still being investigated, research suggests several factors may contribute, including cardiovascular disease, socioeconomic status, and potential genetic predispositions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with Dr Maestre, another leading dementia specialist in the region is Dr James Falcon, who has been working with his physician father Antonio to lead more research into the problems plaguing Starr County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former soldier, who served in Afghanistan before returning to Rio Grande City, previously told Today: 'There isn't a single one of us that works here [in the clinic] that doesn't  know somebody personally that has been affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For a while growing up we were the poorest county in the country, that's the reality of where we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Working here in the clinic, there isn't a day that goes by where we don't see somebody with some kind of memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of people are early in the course of their disease [but] you see pretty advanced patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, around 12 percent of the state’s population over the age of 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Starr County, temperatures range from an average minimum of 44F in January to an average maximum of 99F in July, while the average annual temperature is 74F&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mayra Garza, who has been helping as a volunteer at the Falcon's El Faro Health and Therapeutics clinic in Rio Grande City on Alzheimer's research, explains that it is an issue close to her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'My family has been highly impacted by this Alzheimer's disease, both my parents have / had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important to understand why this is impacting me and my family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month it emerged that the remains of an 84-year-old woman suffering from dementia had been found in the city of Roma in Starr County after her family reported her missing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authorities confirmed that Maria Soprano suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's, which may have contributed to her becoming disoriented and lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maestre told this website that urgent action needs to be taken to prevent such devastating events from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes: 'I think this is a perfect storm, where environmental issues and adverse early life experiences come together to make the brain more vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I say life experiences I mean not only pollutants, I mean extreme heat, and a car-centric environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To make progress, we need more research on what is going on, and more infrastructure for care and prevention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week the Texas House passed a Senate bill that would create a $3 billion Texas research fund for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, if it goes ahead, would issue grants for research and encourage collaboration among universities, medical institutions and other experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, around 12 percent of the state’s population over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include forgetfulness, irritability, struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word and being confused about time and place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:45:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

id="mol-53b2aca0-25cc-11f0-889f-83acd4978611" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; found there were 25,000 visits between 2022 and 2023 - about 68 per day - for symptoms related to semaglutide, the main

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (NEISS-CADES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The database keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on 551 documented cases, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03258"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;estimated 24,499 ED visits were due to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 70 percent were for GI symptoms, including 58 percent for nausea and vomiting, 25 percent with abdominal pain and 12 percent with diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventeen percent of ED visits were because of low blood sugar and six percent of people were experiencing an allergic reaction to the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine percent of the visits involved medication error.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the visits to the ED, about one-third of people with low blood sugar and 15 percent of people with GI symptoms were admitted to the hospital for closer observation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not reveal if any deaths related to the medications occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting and constipation are listed as common side effects of Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More severe side effects listed include thyroid tumors, changes in vision, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, dehydration and kidney complications, allergic reactions, food or liquid getting into the lungs and gallbladder complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being resigned to being obese, Brad Roberts couldn't believe it when he lost 24lbs in a month on weight loss drugs. However, in a shocking turn of events, the 44-year-old father-of-four and his wife Stacey are suing the doctor who prescribed him the weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to these, Wegovy also lists depression or suicidal thoughts, kidney failure, and increased heart rate as side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one lawsuit, Ozempic user Brad Roberts claims&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14507341/ozempic-dieter-suing-doctor-treating-weight-loss-drug.html"&gt; the drug caused debilitating joint and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;, as well as severe stomachaches that confined him to his bed for 18 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other claims in the lawsuit include that he has trouble walking and suffers from memory loss, vision problems and issues communicating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of the court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, Dr Yadira Lockard, a psychologist who has served as Roberts' therapist since January 2015, describes his deterioration after he was allegedly 'dangerously' overmedicated with weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she noticed a concerning change in his behavior about a year into his weight loss and eventually his condition deteriorated until he no longer had 'the mental capacity to make life decisions of any particular consequence to himself or on behalf of his family.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the FDA has received hundreds of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12636411/ozempic-weight-loss-suicide-thoughts-depression-fda.html"&gt;reports of suicidal thoughts and depression from patients on weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt; since 2010, as well as 36 deaths 'by suicide or suspected suicide.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2023, 265 reports of suicidal thoughts and depression among people on weight-loss drugs had been received by the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/wegovy-other-weight-loss-drugs-scrutinized-over-reports-suicidal-thoughts-2023-09-28/"&gt;Reuters &lt;/a&gt;reported, though instances of suicidal thoughts on the drugs are unverified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year revealed dozens of patients were suing Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, claiming they experienced extreme side effects they were not warned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients claim they suffered from gastroparesis - stomach paralysis. The condition, which can be life-threatening, causes a build-up of food in the gut and symptoms include nausea, vomiting and severe pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brea Hand, 23, told DailyMail.com she required five hospital visits before doctors diagnosed her with gastroparesis, which was allegedly caused by Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com reviewed more than a dozen lawsuits filed between November 2023 and January 2024 by patients who were diagnosed with gastroparesis after using Ozempic and Wegovy, including some who suffered 'life-threatening' bowel injuries and now face lifelong consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a woman who used Ozempic and Mounjaro claims she was diagnosed with gastroparesis, which caused her to vomit so much some of her teeth feel out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another, a woman was diagnosed with a 'life-threatening bowel injury' after using Ozempic and underwent surgery that lasted nearly nine hours. Doctors said she would be in pain 'for the rest of her life' and 'will never have a solid bowel movement again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the number of semaglutide-related hospital visits is concerning, it is on par with visits for side effects from other drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493432/#:~:text=Based%20on%2096%E2%80%89925%20cases%20(mean%20patient%20age%2C%2049%20years%3B%2055%25%20female)%2C%20there%20were%20an%20estimated%206.1%20(95%25%20CI%2C%204.8%2D7.5)%20ED%20visits%20for%20medication%20harms%20per%201000%20population%20annually%20and%2038.6%25%20(95%25%20CI%2C%2035.2%25%2D41.9%25)%20resulted%20in%20hospitalization."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found roughly six in 1,000 Americans visit the ED every year due to medication-related complications and a 2022 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757641/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found over-the-counter cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ED visits in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:32:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>美国100个性传播疾病热点城市揭晓：这座令人震惊的富裕小镇隐藏着肮脏的秘密--《每日邮报》 | America's 100 STD hotspot cities revealed: And the shocking wealthy town with a dirty secret - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQlJNT3p3Mnc5LUNseGRpaWZheEFOaFpIMHRZUUFMUHJRQTgxVU5PNVFTTlJ5OGZUaDBfUENONHNOY205Zm1OR1BHQmRaLUdYQVJCUllVMldZYTBZano5MDJyTGM4NzZDRFBMOUNLaEdoS3NPRUtSenBjYk0zVXJRbDJONXZvTVoxdTEzamM4enlNNmVFSjBkSUxqQmlXT29QNkxzX2tnTjM4d9IBrwFBVV95cUxOU3JzdHdSQmRObXhxSE44ZFFyMTctVWpwS21wSzR4QVJpYnNvTEdXb0REX0l6NEFDMkpaYUV2N0RUdFBxUEE2d3FPdi05Rm1jSnZrUmJLOXUtYlVrWndzM2dQTVdGWW05aWxsUm10M0lSQ2RKaWVVTHZsQ1FoUS1IZ09ibDF2dWFybG9OLU95cE9DamFvd3VtM0VPbTMyd3Q2a2pINDBQMTVRaFowcGxr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cities in the eastern half of the US may be rife with sexually transmitted infections, a new analysis shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Innerbody Research, a medical website run by a team of scientists, examined &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-b8147080-253f-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;'s 2023 data for rates of STIs across America and found the 10 cities with the highest rate of infections, with Detroit, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-b81756b0-253f-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, topping the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Midwestern city had about 1,500 infections per 100,000 residents in 2023, jumping eight places from the previous year's report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was followed by Philadelphia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-212b29e0-25c4-11f0-b349-7df794508157"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;

Baltimore, Maryland and New Orleans, Louisiana, made up fourth, fifth and sixth places, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the first time ever, the team named Detroit City as the metro area with the highest overall STI rates across the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Washington DC was &lt;span&gt;found to have a rate of 1,334 overall STI cases per 100,000 people as of 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken down, there were 22,738 cases of chlamydia, 6,450 cases of gonorrhea, 489 cases of syphilis and 593 cases of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-cb0bde61-2541-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a" class=""&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city, where reports suggest it takes having a net worth of over $2million to feel wealthy, has reportedly seen an uptick of cases among younger generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Shenell Williams-Davis, a sexual health coordinator with Mary’s Center Public Health Outreach Services in DC, new dating trends and relationship structures may be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtoninformer.com/std-rates-washington-dc/"&gt;The Washington Informer&lt;/a&gt;: 'The doors of [varied sexual preferences] have opened up, and a lot of people are starting to experience [a multitude of things]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's no longer just one-on-one [sexual relationships], but [people experiencing multiple partner relationships]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So that brings the issue where I may treat three people, but where are the other two in the group, or I can treat three, but where are the other four people? This [creates a breeding ground] for reinfection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite making up only a quarter of the population, young people between 15 to 24 years old account up for about half of new STIs every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years of rising rates of STIs has culminated in what experts call a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14074021/Americas-STD-explosion-laid-bare-shocking-number-people-catching-one-minute.html"&gt; public health crisis&lt;/a&gt;, driven by decreased condom usage and poor sex education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detroit saw &lt;/span&gt;20,830 cases of chlamydia, 7,983 cases of gonorrhea, 628 cases of syphilis and 386 cases of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-4784c6d0-25f3-11f0-ba72-17419599ac08" class=""&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across the US, Chlamydia is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6784019/STD-rates-soar-record-high-driven-rising-rates-40s.html" class=""&gt;the most common STI&lt;/a&gt;, with 492.2 cases per 100,000 people as of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the rate is increasing, mostly driven by a recent uptick in the number of seniors citizens contracting chlamydia due to increased sexual activity in later life, limited sexual health education, low condom use and the misconception that STIs don't affect older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often called a 'silent infection' as many people experience no symptoms but if they do appear, they can be mild and may not show up for several weeks after exposure - making it easier to spread as people keep having unprotected sex without knowing they are suffering from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of chlamydia include abnormal or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness, pain during intercourse, irregular bleeding, and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated chlamydia can lead to several long-term complications, primarily affecting reproductive health, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Gonorrhea cases fell for a second year in 2024, declining seven percent from 2022 to below pre-pandemic levels due to an increased availability of at-home STI kits. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. And while the infection can usually be easily treated, some strains are resistant to commonly used antibiotics - making them harder to clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis has increased by one percent nationwide and the rise - while small - is worrying public health officials, as the disease can advance to damage the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart if it goes untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is most commonly reported among 30- to 34-year-olds, a slightly older group compared to other infections due to peak sexual activity during those years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms begin with small open sores on the genitals, mouth, or rectum, as well as enlarged lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the second stage, a skin rash develops, as well as genitals sores, fever, muscle and joint pain, vision changes, and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the infection advances further, it can inflame and damage heart valves and slowly degrade the brain, causing personality changes, memory loss, difficulty making decisions, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most of the illnesses can be cured with a round of antibiotics and abstinence from sex, HIV can attack the body's immune system and lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once infected with HIV, there is no effective cure currently and proper medical care to control the virus is required. In the US, approximately 8,000 people die each year from HIV-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Washington DC was found to have 1,334 overall STI cases per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People, particularly young people, are using condoms less regularly. They went from the top contraceptive tool for 75 percent of men in 2011 to 42 percent of men by 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite making up only a quarter of the population, young people between 15 to 24 years old account up for about half of new STIs every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 100 US adults has an STI, including over 209,000 cases of syphilis, over 600,000 cases of gonorrhea, and over 1.6million &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-64252/What-symptoms-chlamydia.html"&gt;cases of chlamydia&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are some positive signs that a decade-long rise could be plateauing and even turning a corner. There were 2.4million sexually transmitted infections in 2023, a two percent decline from 2022.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eric Rodriguez, CEO and co-founder of Innerbody Research, SAID: 'The number one thing that an individual can do to help address this issue is to get tested more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we've found is that people don't realize how important it is to get tested regularly, because many STDs are manageable if they are caught early. Many of them are curable. But you can't manage and you can't cure what you don't know.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:32:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQlJNT3p3Mnc5LUNseGRpaWZheEFOaFpIMHRZUUFMUHJRQTgxVU5PNVFTTlJ5OGZUaDBfUENONHNOY205Zm1OR1BHQmRaLUdYQVJCUllVMldZYTBZano5MDJyTGM4NzZDRFBMOUNLaEdoS3NPRUtSenBjYk0zVXJRbDJONXZvTVoxdTEzamM4enlNNmVFSjBkSUxqQmlXT29QNkxzX2tnTjM4d9IBrwFBVV95cUxOU3JzdHdSQmRObXhxSE44ZFFyMTctVWpwS21wSzR4QVJpYnNvTEdXb0REX0l6NEFDMkpaYUV2N0RUdFBxUEE2d3FPdi05Rm1jSnZrUmJLOXUtYlVrWndzM2dQTVdGWW05aWxsUm10M0lSQ2RKaWVVTHZsQ1FoUS1IZ09ibDF2dWFybG9OLU95cE9DamFvd3VtM0VPbTMyd3Q2a2pINDBQMTVRaFowcGxr</guid></item><item><title>找到平衡点的医生- Escape Collective | The doctor who found his balance - Escape Collective</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1keU93eXlDRlhaZXJnQUFFTm00NXlBcUdzWUhoUW1XU01EQ1ZvWTl1cnFnT1I1WmJPX0RnUDZBdWJOOVdkaVNnQk5ibGtpT202amdvMVNsUDR5U0JVTmZ3NDA2cFo1UHhfUFhBbDZlVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article"&gt;
            

            &lt;p&gt;The great irony of my job is that I seldom get to ride my bike like I used to. But while I was sitting in Melbourne lamenting missing &lt;em&gt;Escape's&lt;/em&gt; annual Member Summit at the Spring Classics due to family commitments, I received a late invite to join the Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) summit in Kyoto. Given that's a much more doable four-day trip without jetlag, I couldn't say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I wasn’t about to write a piece about riding down &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;sakura&lt;/a&gt;-lined roads, sushi breaks, and onsen soaks after big days in the saddle (although all of that did happen). No one needs to hear about me gloating about my perfect riding vacation. I wanted something deeper – a story that was more than just a scenic diary entry. I didn't know what that would be until the final night of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RCC summit brought together 130 riders from around the world to explore the backroads and mountain passes of Kyoto, a city with cycling routes as rich as its culture. On day one, I struck up a conversation with a softly spoken Japanese rider named Aki. He was riding a classic De Rosa with rim brakes and 80th anniversary Campy Record. My kinda guy. He pointed out how lucky we were to be there at the peak of sakura season and told me a little about the city. I didn't see him much for the next couple of rides, and I figured that was that – just one of the many friendly, fleeting interactions you have on these kinds of trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the queen stage on Saturday, there was a final dinner where &lt;a href="https://escapecollective.com/new-ceo-fran-millers-vision-for-raphas-future/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Fran Millar&lt;/a&gt; (Rapha's new CEO) spoke about the renewed importance of RCC to the business and a bunch of fun awards were given out. One such award was given to Aki for his book – the first book ever published about RCC and how his first summit literally changed the course of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone wrote an entire book about RCC? This was the story I was waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-life-consumed-by-work"&gt;A life consumed by work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I became a member of Rapha RCC 10 years ago," Aki told me when we sat down for a proper chat. A dedicated internal medicine doctor specialising in renal dialysis, Aki's life was consumed by work before discovering RCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to work every day, from morning to night," he explained, describing the relentless pace that left no space for personal pursuits. "I work from 8am to 11 at night, almost every day. Only Sundays I can have for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demands of running his own clinic with 40-50 employees meant he had no time for exercise. "I became so fat," he admitted with a smile. For nearly 30 years, the bicycle that had once been his passion in youth collected dust as Aki focused entirely on his medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he turned 50, his daughters insisted on a health check-up. The results were a wake-up call. He was nearly 20 kg overweight and battling the silent beginnings of multiple lifestyle diseases. He knew the path he was on. As a doctor, he’d advised patients on it countless times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he changed. Slowly, and then all at once. He adjusted his diet. He started exercising. He even dusted off the old road bike he’d bought in university – now a relic – and began riding again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, he discovered Rapha. Not the clothing, but the culture. “I just wanted to belong to something interesting,” he said. That sense of curiosity led him to join RCC, although he had no idea what it really was at the time. But when he saw an announcement for an RCC Summit in the south of France in 2017, something clicked. Aki made a decisive move that would alter his life's trajectory. "Until then, I had not been abroad since I was 30," he said. "So I lost my passport!" He decided this was his time to go overseas again. "I deserved that. So first I reserved the summit, then I went to get a new passport."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience was transformative. "It was only me, no other Japanese were there. But that's a good thing for me, because I had to communicate with other people. If there were a lot of Japanese there, maybe I don't speak to the foreigners. But since I was alone, I could enjoy the people and culture of foreign countries. That shocked me – it was so interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/A--1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/A--1.jpg 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/A--1.jpg 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/A--1.jpg 1059w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that summit, Aki made a profound decision: "I decided I will work hard, but also I will work hard at enjoying my life, a lot. So every year after that, I go abroad for riding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-life-changing-connection"&gt;A life-changing connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RCC community opened new worlds for Aki, but his story takes an even more meaningful turn through his connection with Christine O’Connell, a fellow RCC member from London. At the summit, he met this tall, middle-aged woman with short blonde hair who, like him, didn't look particularly fast but pedalled powerfully on long rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I talked to her at breakfast, she seemed quiet," Aki recalled. He later found out she had just had surgery for breast cancer. A year later they discovered that the cancer had returned, but this time it had spread to her brain and bones, requiring more surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She may not look it, but she's a breast cancer survivor," Aki explained, recounting how the Rapha London community helped her prepare for and complete the challenging L'Étape du Tour race the very same year she underwent brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galvanised by her experience, Christine started "&lt;a href="https://www.onemorecity.cc/?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;One More City&lt;/a&gt;," a charity campaign ride supporting breast cancer research. "The first year, they started only with four people, and it's open every year, getting larger and larger," Aki said with admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aki described the concept's powerful symbolism; how cancer patients deal with their disease much like cyclists approach a long journey: handling treatment, enduring side effects, going through regular checkups, and overcoming problems one by one, moving towards their goals little by little, city by city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-parallel-journeys"&gt;The parallel journeys&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Aki's story particularly powerful is the parallel between his own physical challenge and Christine's battle with cancer. Last year, just weeks before the Étape, Aki suffered a serious accident while training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hit a small animal on the mountain and crashed, and I broke my pelvis," he explained. "I couldn't walk, I couldn't ride." Most people would have cancelled, but Aki was determined. "I have only a few years left, so I decided to go anyway to France."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/-1-.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/-1-.JPG 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/-1-.JPG 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/-1-.JPG 1426w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped training completely and focused on recovery, trying "everything – new medicine, consultations with specialists." His condition improved enough that he took his bike to France and lined up on the morning of the race, having done nothing but rest until that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the event, after struggling through pain to reach a checkpoint, Aki had to abandon the race. "After 80 kilometres and 2,300 metres climbing, it was my limit, so I quit." Meanwhile, Christine – despite having recently discovered lung metastases and undergoing therapy – continued on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was behind the time cut at the checkpoint," Aki recalled with emotion. "She didn't get an official finishing time, but she decided to continue the race – and she finished."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He saw in this moment a profound metaphor: "I had a problem with a bone fracture. She had a problem with metastatic breast cancer. Two people who knew each other from seven years ago, both with problems, riding close at that point. I quit because I had to continue my work; I couldn't risk getting worse. But she continued because she needed the confidence to live her life more. One person quit, the other person finished. That's very moving for me. That's why I wrote the book."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-2.57.38-PM.jpg 1560w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christine O’Connell, founder of One More City.

While work still occupies about 70% of his life, cycling takes 10%, and he dedicates another 20% to writing. The RCC summit inspired not just his cycling renaissance but also a creative awakening – &lt;em&gt;Go Over the Peak&lt;/em&gt; is his fourth book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first book told the story of a massive COVID outbreak at his clinic and elderly care facility. "Many people died," he said. "We struggled to protect, care for, and cure patients. I also got infected and was in severe condition, hospitalised for three weeks. My father died from COVID." Writing became his way of processing this tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His second book recounted his early career, including his time working alongside Katalin Karikó at the University of Pennsylvania – the scientist who later won a Nobel Prize for her work on mRNA technology that enabled COVID vaccines. "She was Hungarian; I was Japanese. We both didn't speak English well, and we spoke English friendly in the laboratory because we were both foreigners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His third book is deeply personal, connecting his formative year in Kyoto as a student with his decision to establish his family grave there, creating a link between his past, present, and future. It reflects on how his thinking and feeling style was shaped during his time in Kyoto, and how that continues to influence his life decisions today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trip to Kyoto was a return for him. “Kyoto is special,” he said. “That’s where I started to think deeply. And maybe where everything returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="legacy-and-looking-forward"&gt;Legacy and looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 65, Aki is acutely aware of time. "I have only a few years left, maybe cycling for five years, but writing, maybe I can do more. I'm changing my life. I want to leave something behind – for my children, for others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Go Over the Peak' carries multiple meanings. As Aki explained: "I've already passed the peak of my life, maybe. And Christine, she had many hills for her treatment. She's getting over and over and over every year. She's afraid that every year something will happen again, but she is so positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That positivity – finding joy in life's challenges rather than surrendering to them – is what changed Aki's life. It's not just about the cycling; it's about discovering that life can begin at 50, and can be as rich and meaningful as you make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aki's upcoming plans include a trip to the Dolomites this summer and joining the One More City ride next autumn. While he rarely rides with friends at home due to his work schedule, cycling gives him clarity of thought. "Riding in the saddle, I think clearly and get ideas for my novels," he said. "Cycling is good exercise, good thinking time, and makes my body and heart healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his successful medical career and newfound balance, Aki has no plans to retire – Japanese doctors typically work until the end of their lives, he explained. What he has found instead is a way to live more fully while still fulfilling his responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel better than most 65-year-olds," he said with a smile. Looking at him and riding with him, it's hard to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Aki, I found much more than just an interesting story. I found a testament to the power of community, the importance of balance, and a reminder that it's never too late to rediscover what makes life meaningful. His journey shows that sometimes the peak is the place where the view becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to read Aki's book, you can find the English version &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://escapecollective.com/content/files/2025/04/Murasawa-Takehiko------a-novel--Cyclist---.pdf" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (note that it is a quick Google translation and accuracy is not guaranteed).

Summers can be hot and humid, while winters are chilly but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to stay:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Kyoto (near Kawaramachi or Gion) offers easy access to restaurants, temples, and cycling routes. For quieter surroundings, stay near Arashiyama or the northern outskirts, where scenic rides begin just outside your door. We stayed at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dusit.com/dusitthani-kyoto/?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Dusit Thani Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; which was absolutely beautiful and fairly central. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Must eat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try Kyoto’s signature dishes like yudofu (tofu hot pot), kaiseki (traditional multi-course meal), and matcha sweets. Don't miss Nishiki Market for street food or a riverside drinks and dinner along the Kamo River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riding etiquette:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ride on the left-hand side of the road. The law says that you need to ride single file, and common etiquette is that groups should be no more than 10 riders large. Drivers are typically good, but sometimes not overly aware of riders on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to pack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring and autumn can go from cold to warm throughout the day, so layer appropriately and it's always best to bring a good rain jacket with you. Bike shops are plentiful and so are convenience stores (which are surprising excellent for a proper meal) so no need to bring anything special. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punctuality and politeness are highly valued. Bow slightly when greeting or thanking someone. Always remove shoes when entering traditional inns or temples. Learning a few key Japanese phrases will open doors as English is sometimes more rare than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routes to ride around Kyoto:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;There appeared to be endless riding options around Kyoto, but to get you started here are three of the days we rode which were spectacular:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14135539210?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; | &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14143230960?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; | &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14151505108?ref=escapecollective.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"&gt;&lt;p class="kg-callout-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;Disclosure: Thank you to Rapha who paid for travel, accomodation, and meals to make my trip to Kyoto possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists looking to tackle our ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-isn-t-just-one-obesity-gene-linked-to-being-overweight"&gt;obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; have made an important discovery: Intermittent calorie restriction leads to significant changes both in the gut and the brain, which may open up new options for maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from China studied 25 volunteers classed as obese over a period of 62 days, during which they took part in an intermittent energy restriction (IER) program – a regime that involves careful control of calorie intake and relative &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-intermittent-fasting-or-calorie-counting-better-for-weight-loss-new-study-weighs-in"&gt;fasting on some days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the participants in the study lose weight – 7.6 kilograms (16.8 pounds) or 7.8 percent of their body weight on average – there was also evidence of shifts in the activity of obesity-related regions of the brain, and in the make-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here we show that an IER diet changes the human brain-gut-microbiome axis," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; health researcher Qiang Zeng from the Second Medical Center and National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases in China when the results were published in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The observed changes in the gut microbiome and in the activity in addiction-related brain regions during and after weight loss are highly dynamic and coupled over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144243" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642.jpg" alt="Food on a wooden plate in one section with cutlery placed to like hands on a clock" class="size-full wp-image-144243" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144243" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An IER diet involves careful control of calorie intake and relative fasting on some days. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFjkkQB-bU/"&gt;vetrestudio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear what causes these changes, or whether the gut is influencing the brain or vice versa. However, we do know that the gut and the brain are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-pinpoints-specific-gut-bacteria-linked-to-alzheimers"&gt;closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, so treating certain regions of the brain could be a way to control food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes in brain activity, spotted via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans, were in regions known to be important in the regulation of appetite and addiction – including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_part_of_inferior_frontal_gyrus"&gt;inferior frontal orbital gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the gut microbiome changes, analyzed via stool samples and blood measurements, were linked to particular brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bacteria &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coprococcus comes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobutyricum_hallii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eubacterium hallii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were negatively associated with activity in the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus, an area involved in executive function, including our willpower when it comes to food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gut microbiome is thought to communicate with the brain in a complex, two-directional way," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; medical scientist Xiaoning Wang from the State Clinic Center for Geriatrics in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The microbiome produces neurotransmitters and neurotoxins which access the brain through nerves and the blood circulation. In return the brain controls eating behavior, while nutrients from our diet change the composition of the gut microbiome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144241" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144241" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1.jpg" alt="A child eating a slice of watermelon" class="size-full wp-image-144241" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144241" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nutrients from our diet change the composition of the gut microbiome.

&lt;p&gt;Knowing more about how our brains and guts are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/obesity-can-trigger-lasting-changes-in-the-brains-nutrient-response-study-finds"&gt;dependent on each other&lt;/a&gt; could make a huge difference in effectively preventing and reducing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The next question to be answered is the precise mechanism by which the gut microbiome and the brain communicate in obese people, including during weight loss," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Liming Wang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What specific gut microbiome and brain regions are critical for successful weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1269548/full"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in December 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One case is in a suburban Cook County adult resident whose vaccination status is unknown. The other case is in a Chicago adult resident who traveled internationally through O’Hare International Airport in early April, who previously had one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to a news release from the Cook County, Chicago and Illinois departments of public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suburban Cook County resident went to a hospital for medical care Monday and was quickly isolated, according to health officials. The Chicago resident developed a rash April 25 and has been isolating at home since being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are warning that people who were at the following locations on the following dates may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 21: Chicago Public Library – Independence Branch, 4024 N. Elston Ave., Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 21: Fittingly Delicious, 3939 W. Irving Park Road, Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 22: O’Hare Airport, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., especially in Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 23: O’Hare Airport, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., especially in Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 25: Aldi, 7235 39th St., Lyons, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 27:  Shell, 3901 S. Harlem Ave., Stickney, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 28: Mobil: 2945 S. Harlem Ave., Berwyn, from 10:20 a.m. to 1 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who may have been exposed should notify their health care providers if they are unsure about their vaccination status. If they develop symptoms they should talk to their health care providers or a health care facility before going to a medical office or emergency department, so the facility can take steps to prevent other patients and health care providers from being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are considered 97% protective against the measles, and one dose is considered 93% protective. Children typically receive the first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine at age 12 to 15 months, and the second dose from ages 4 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cook County cases follow the &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/24/marion-first-measles-case/"&gt;first case of measles this year in Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in an unvaccinated adult in downstate Marion, reported last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also come amid a surge of cases nationwide, as people express wariness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;As of April 24, there had been 884 confirmed measles cases across the country, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the second-highest number of cases in the U.S. in 25 years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm?s_cid=mm7414a1_w"&gt;a CDC report&lt;/a&gt; released in April. In the U.S., two children and one adult have died of the illness so far this year, all of whom were unvaccinated — the first U.S. measles deaths in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas has had the largest outbreak, with 663 cases as of April 29, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. Of those 663 cases, 635 have been in individuals who were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccinaton statuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are experiencing a resurgence of measles in the United States, despite the fact that two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent it,” said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim chief operating officer at the Cook County Department of Public Health, in a news release. “Misinformation has contributed to declining vaccination rates and fueled recent outbreaks. The MMR vaccine has been in use for over 50 years, is highly effective, and has protected millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that can spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes and can appear up to 21 days after a person is exposed. Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss and brain damage, and the illness can be especially dangerous for babies, young children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local health officials in Illinois say people ages 12 months and older who plan to travel out of the country should make sure they have two doses of the vaccine at least two weeks before traveling. They are also urging anyone vaccinated before 1968 to check with their health care provider about potentially being revaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can check their medical records or contact their health care providers to see their vaccination statuses. They can also visit the Illinois Department of Public Health’s online portal, &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Encourages+Measles+Vaccination&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fdph.illinois.gov%2fvaxverify.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1333387&amp;amp;sfmc_id=128588093"&gt;Vax Verify&lt;/a&gt;, to check their immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination appointments are available at Cook County Health community health centers in Chicago and suburban Cook County by calling 833-308-1988. The Chicago Department of Public Health offers free MMR vaccinations at clinics throughout the city. People can register for appointments at &lt;a href="http://getvaxchi.chicago.gov"&gt;getvaxchi.chicago.gov&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the clinics, though the clinics also take walk-ins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cook County Department of Public Health is investigating the case in suburban Cook County, and the city health department is investigating the Chicago case. The departments are working together to identify and notify people who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/30/citys-public-health-department-declares-measle-outbreak-over-according-to-report/"&gt;Illinois’ last cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; were in March 2024, when 67 cases were reported, with most linked to a Chicago shelter for migrants on the Lower West Side. That outbreak was the largest in Illinois since 1990, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;

Clover Glen Apartment Community has 92 units that say it offers independent living for residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, some residents are left in the dark when it comes to transparency from the complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Million’s mother moved into the complex and, within a few weeks, became sick. After a birthday trip to Cincinnati, she was rushed to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She wasn’t feeling well,” Tim said. “For her to be wiped out in the hospital for two weeks. Her organs were shutting down as were mine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Million and his mother were diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columbus Public Health Department says they’re aware of four confirmed legionellosis cases at Clover Glen. The last case was reported in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department is continuing to monitor additional cases, but there have not been any new cases since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Health, Legionella are bacteria that grow naturally in the environment, and especially in warm water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It occurs in freshwater lakes and streams. However, the quantities in natural water bodies are generally insufficient to cause disease.  Growth of Legionella can occur in building water systems where exposure to aerosols containing the bacteria can cause disease,” said&lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/Legionella-Environmental/legionella-environmental-welcome" target="_blank" title="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/Legionella-Environmental/legionella-environmental-welcome" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; the Ohio Department of Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columbus Public Health says Clover Glen has been working with an outside consultant on remediation and prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jedidiah Bressman is an attorney representing some residents from the complex. He tells ABC 6 that he sent the company operating the property a letter telling the complex to keep all records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this has to go to litigation so we can get access to those materials,” said Bressman. “We think the residents have a right to know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reached out to National Church Residences, the group operating the complex.

One driver is the overuse of antibiotics, with greater exposure to drugs offering bacteria more chances to learn how to evade them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But a focus on overuse has meant access has been neglected, the experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00108-2/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, is the first to quantify the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries. It was led by the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GardP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers focused on Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan and South Africa, and used modelling data on the number of cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections, which are drug-resistant and on the rise. They then looked at sales data for eight types of antibiotic that could be used as treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Across the eight countries, there were an estimated 1.5m CRGN infections and almost 480,000 deaths in 2019. Just under 104,000 courses of antibiotics active against CRGNs were procured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Appropriate antibiotics were available in only 6.9% of cases on average – ranging from 0.2% in Kenya to 14.9% in Mexico and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cohn, GardP’s global access director, said it was a pattern likely to be repeated in other poorer nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The infections in the study included pneumonias, bloodstream infections and complicated urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The “No 1 thing” the lack of drugs did was to drive morbidity and mortality, Cohn stressed, but it could also drive AMR. Trying other, ineffective antibiotics, was likely to mean a longer duration of antibiotic use – &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38833103/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;linked in studies&lt;/a&gt; to increases in resistant bacteria. Killing drug-resistant bacteria with the correct treatment would stop them spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There were many factors behind the treatment gap, she said. Sick people may not make it to a hospital for diagnosis, or those who do may not be able to afford treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are focusing introduction of newer antibiotics in the US and in a few countries in Europe. That’s not where the burden is,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are really trying to change the narrative to say we can’t just focus on stewardship, surveillance and containment in low- and middle-income communities, while we’re focused on just innovation in high-income countries. We actually have to focus on both all at once, in all places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the volley, his soldiers collected the arrows and fired them back, winning the day with weapons supplied by the opposition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one centuries later, microbiologists have uncovered a molecular echo of that famous ploy inside common gut bacteria that can defeat viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.hzau.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Huazhong Agricultural University&lt;/a&gt; have found that &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;coli&lt;/em&gt; carries a previously unknown antiviral system they have named “Kongming.” Like its namesake, the defense hijacks a viral enzyme to launch a counterstrike that ultimately destroys the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work reveals a completely new immune signaling pathway in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-gut-bacteria-behave-like-vampires-to-target-human-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It also widens the catalog of phage-resistance strategies and hints at applications ranging from cancer diagnostics to next-generation antibiotic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-viruses-against-themselves"&gt;Turning viruses against themselves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every virus that infects bacteria, or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteriophages-use-selfish-genetic-elements-as-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phage&lt;/a&gt;, must replicate its genetic material at breakneck speed to outpace cellular defenses. Many phages therefore inject specialized nucleotide kinases, enzymes that churn out the building blocks of DNA and RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kongming system detects that very enzyme and forces it to synthesize a different molecule altogether: a distinctive nucleotide signal known as dITP. Once made, dITP activates a protein complex, triggering a cascade that leads the bacterial cell to self-destruct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve discovered a new antiviral signaling pathway in bacteria that, ironically, relies on a viral enzyme to produce the alarm signal that triggers defense – just like the historical Kongming, who used the production of enemy’s own arrows against them,” said Professor Rafael Pinilla-Redondo, co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the phage hands the bacterium the very biochemical arrow that brings about its demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-die-to-defeat-viruses"&gt;Bacteria die to defeat viruses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suicide might sound like an odd way to survive infection, but in bacterial colonies it can be remarkably effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bacterium sacrifices itself to stop the virus – which may sound dramatic, but it’s an incredibly effective strategy. By dying, it takes the virus down with it, preventing the infection from spreading to other bacteria in the population. It’s a bit like blowing up a bridge to stop an advancing enemy,” Pinilla-Redondo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because phages must complete their replication cycles inside living hosts, the premature death of a single cell prevents the release of hundreds of viral progeny. A few sacrificial cells can protect the community – much like programmed cell death in the human immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viruses-can-launch-counter-attacks"&gt;Viruses can launch counter attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phages are not passive targets. The scientists observed that some viruses carry auxiliary enzymes able to degrade dITP before it reaches lethal levels, effectively cutting the alarm wires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some viruses have figured out how to get around Kongming,” noted first-author Ruiliang Zhao, a doctoral candidate in Pinilla-Redondo’s lab. “They carry special enzymes that break down the molecules needed to trigger the system. It’s their way of cutting off the cables of the alarm before it goes off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such counterintelligence highlights the ongoing evolutionary arms race between microbes and their viral predators, a contest that has spawned &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-gets-a-revolutionary-upgrade-with-new-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;, toxin–antitoxin modules, and now the Kongming pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kongming-beyond-the-gut"&gt;Kongming beyond the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although initially characterized in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, genetic sleuthing revealed dozens of Kongming-like operons in soil and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/23-new-marine-bacteria-species-discovered-that-influence-global-ocean-cycles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;marine bacteria&lt;/a&gt; across the globe. This suggests that the mechanism is not a niche curiosity but a broadly distributed archetype for bacteria to defeat viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping its genetic hallmarks, scientists can begin to predict which environmental microbes harbor similar systems. This information is critical for biogeochemical modeling and for developing phage therapies that must bypass native immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-therapy-blocked-by-bacteria"&gt;Therapy blocked by bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of antibiotic resistance has rekindled interest in treating infections with phages tailored to kill specific pathogens. Yet a therapeutic phage will fail if its target bacterium possesses a potent defense like Kongming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To develop effective phage therapies, we need to understand the natural immune systems bacteria use to resist viral attacks,” noted Pinilla-Redondo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed knowledge of Kongming and its viral countermeasures can guide the selection, or engineering of phages that slip past bacterial alarms, improving clinical success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biotech-uses-for-kongming"&gt;Biotech uses for Kongming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s significance is not limited to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-infectious-disease-landscape-is-changing-and-we-must-prepare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; control. Because the Kongming effector complex responds exclusively to dITP, a non-canonical nucleotide implicated in genomic instability and certain cancers, it could serve as a molecular sensor for diagnostic assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the Kongming immune effector complex specifically responds to dITP, it could be used to detect this non-canonical nucleotide – opening the door to interesting biotechnological applications,” Zhao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic biologists may also harness the pathway to build programmable cell-death switches or precision gene-editing safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-bacterial-immunity-revealed"&gt;New bacterial immunity revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, comparative genomics has uncovered an astonishing diversity of bacterial antiviral systems, yet many remain poorly understood. Kongming demonstrates how a fresh look can rewrite assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, hijacking a viral enzyme to synthesize an immune signal was a trick known only in certain viruses themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery shows that bacteria use viral “enemy arrows” to fight viruses, highlighting a richer immune toolkit in nature than once believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turning a pathogen’s own resource into an executioner, the Kongming system offers an elegant illustration of molecular jiu-jitsu – one that not only deepens our understanding of microbial warfare but also points the way toward innovative therapies and diagnostic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads6055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 22:21:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPNHZoNE85NnRMSlA1bjJFbXA5WXR3UEVoMl9Nb1dVOU5aS3ctV212OHZ5dUN4dUlyY0pyNnFvOHp5N29SVXJfTTNHQngzTXhuRmdmTldIVDJkdkNURFZGLUVYT0JpRm56M0tSQkpIUkZBTzI4bG9EUVFEZ3JLLXpKSjg4ckhQekVERl84eA</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州麻疹爆发|感染者参加了德克萨斯游骑兵队的比赛- WFAA | Texas measles outbreak | Infected person attended Texas Rangers game - WFAA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwJBVV95cUxNN2JlTFFOX0oyeTBHY1pfMHk3M0RmMG1hUEpZOG5RbHNKMFpnNFp6cG53V0hrSHNVNjNfRWFTZE4zYm45M3VUOVhYaEI0dmpld2FjUkVITWZyNDdSSFhKVDlfcDhOWjVvSFJCUEdWYklPS3VyZy10dzFISWtiM2NLbnJjWmJxVUNxSEJVZ3JSMTdsdklyUFRlaWwtX3c3T0FvYzRmU3VLOEJaQW16dkQ3RUp3aTZPS2V3N1RvanREay1rV1dFWFN5c3lRd242dkp2czlJd2ZoWmIzQUdCSlNzSXUzWVNpLVEta2UyM3U4QkFoa2E4UFQ2OHpQaS1SQ1QyM3hnVlVnTWpYOVNkRUJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;“Today’s case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception,” said Denton County Public Health Director Matt Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DENTON COUNTY, Texas — Another North Texas county became the latest to report its first case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denton County Public Health (DCPH) announced Wednesday that an adult of unknown vaccination status contracted measles. The case marks &lt;a href="/article/news/1-case-of-measles-reported-in-denton-county-health-officials-confirm/287-825c9a39-af8f-422d-8cce-8e2a4d084ef3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the first in Denton County since 2019&lt;/a&gt; during a smaller statewide outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception,” said Dr. Matt Richardson, Denton County's Director of Public Health. “While we haven’t linked this case to an existing outbreak, it highlights two realities: vaccines are important, and if you have signs and symptoms, you should be tested.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious and fatal if untreated. &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here for more information about measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Denton County health officials, the person went to several places after exposure. Most notably, they attended the April 19 Texas Rangers game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Globe Life Field in Arlington, officials said. 39,244 people attended that game. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;Here's everywhere the person went:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a connection is unconfirmed, this case comes amid an &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;outbreak of measles statewide&lt;/a&gt;, which originated in a West Texas Mennonite community and has recently &lt;a href="/article/news/health/collin-county-measles-case-child-middle-school-dfw-lucas-lovejoy/287-6a6a61a9-b683-4f4c-a3dd-60e186340205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;spread to parts of North Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than&lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; 660 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported across Texas, and two children in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, according to April 29 numbers from state health officials. At least 87 of those people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Denton County case announcement comes just one day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited Texas. During his &lt;a href="/article/news/health/tx-tribune-texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/500-1306662b-4730-45cc-8517-2576daa64755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;short appearance in College Station&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, saying more attention should be paid to diabetes and autism.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The facility is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is located at the US Army base Fort Detrick. It conducts research on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases that are deemed “high consequence”—those that pose significant risks to public health. It has 168 employees, including federal workers and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The email, sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, says the lab is terminating studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a rare but lethal mosquito-borne disease that has been reported in several Northern US states. “We are collecting as many samples as is reasonable to ensure these studies are of value,” he says in the email. “We have not been asked to euthanize any animals so these animals will continue to be managed.” Holbrook did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The email says representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were padlocking freezers in BSL-4 labs, those with the highest level of biosafety containment used for studying highly dangerous microbes. Only about a dozen BSL-4 labs exist in North America. These labs work with the viruses that cause Ebola, Lassa fever, and Marburg, types of hemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Research Facility is one of few places in the world that is able to perform medical imaging on animals infected with BSL-4 agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The sacrifice to research is immense,” says Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, on the closure. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, has also been placed on administrative leave, according to the email. Previously, Schmaljohn served as a senior research scientist at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. She has more than 200 research publications and her work has led to several clinical trials of first-of-their kind vaccines. Schmaljohn also did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In an emailed statement provided to WIRED, Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, confirmed the halt in research activity. “NIH has implemented a research pause—referred to as a safety stand-down—at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick. This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause. During the stand-down, no research will be conducted, and access will be limited to essential personnel only, to safeguard the facility and its resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Moss did not elaborate on the nature of the personnel issues, and said he did not know how long the research pause would last. Staff have not received an anticipated reopening date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The research pause is the latest disruption to federal science agencies after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html"&gt;announced at the end of March&lt;/a&gt; that 10,000 people across the vast federal health agency would lose their jobs, including those at the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mass layoffs are part of a restructuring plan being carried out by President Donald Trump’s so-called &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/"&gt;Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:53:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE90UU5PblVYckI0cnFfZjFtMWlzT3RTYjZQYzQyQjNOZVgtNG5rc3J4ekplR0VWU0laOWc4Znd4b1FuT3pWMXdDOENibE8wWWgxeVRteXhyTTAtRjVJek9NYmN2Z1dfOHFVdVJiS0htOGxvME5wMnRzVXZR</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，家庭测试大大降低了这种癌症的死亡率-旧金山纪事报 | At-home tests dramatically reduced death rates for this kind of cancer, study finds - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQeHRqV19XWGo2R0NrcWI5ay1hM2gyNnhuaEhVT3ZjNkdHdy15blRtUnVBdDZrOWhtdnNqN1V6WDZsbFFGblBpNVB0TDBrUUVUM0tCdno5a1NkeklEeUFxc1RkTU5BM0RYTi1wMUlLVktqVDRzNXc2WVdHd2FBMHpTcmRXYU56djdDTXlSTklwU054Y3kzUGE1NV93bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

(P&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;MLB reports the Rangers game the patient went to against the Dodgers was attended by 39,244 people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" data-v-ec26887a data-v-d11d7278&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;"Today’s case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception," said Dr. Matt Richardson, Director of Public Health. "While we haven’t linked this case to an existing outbreak, it highlights two realities: vaccines are important, and if you have signs and symptoms, you should be tested."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" data-v-ec26887a data-v-d11d7278&gt;What we don't know:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Officials did not provide any other information on the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Texas Measles Outbreak&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;State health officials on Tuesday said the number of measles cases in the state linked to a West Texas outbreak has grown to 663 since January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;There have been 87 patients hospitalized since the outbreak started. The state says these hospitalizations are from earlier in the outbreak, and the numbers may increase as DSHS receives records for earlier cases. The number of people currently in the hospital for measles has not been released.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Since January, 16 cases have been reported in people who were considered fully vaccinated and 12 cases in people who only had one dose of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;In Texas, two school-aged children have died from complications with the measles. Both were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, state health officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" data-v-ec26887a data-v-d11d7278&gt;Why you should care:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;A person is contagious from about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Common symptoms of measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The "measles rash" typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;How to prevent getting measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with two doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information on the Denton County measles case comes from Denton County Public Health.

It mainly affects the lungs and can also cause damage to the brain, spinal cord and lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It most commonly spreads through the air when infected people cough or speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once known as consumption, TB is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14332367/Tuberculosis-outbreak-Kansas.html"&gt;one of the deadliest diseases in the world&lt;/a&gt; and according to WHO, over 10 million people across the globe were diagnosed with the illness out of which nearly two million died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, over 10,000 Americans were diagnosed with the infection and 565 died in 2024, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Florida state officials have confirmed a case of active tuberculosis in a Fort Lauderdale high school. (Stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MR Broomfield said in a letter addressed to school parents: 'DOH-Broward and BCPS [Broward County Public Schools] have identified and notified those individuals who have been determined to be a close contact, at this time. No further action is needed unless you are contacted directly.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier, this year an 'unprecedented' tuberculosis outbreak occurred in Kansas -  which left 147 people infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this 67 people became actively ill and 80 contracted the illness but showed no symptoms. Two patients have died, as of now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, Florida reported 681 tuberculosis (TB) cases - a nine percent increase from 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2025, TB cases are increasing both globally and in the United States due to higher international travel and migration, increased reporting, reactivation of latent TB infections and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older people and those with weak immune systems are most at risk of contracting TB - leading to permanent lung damage, even after successful treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB is mostly spread through an exchange of germs containing the bacteria through the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of active TB in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks and signs can include coughing up blood or mucus, chest pains, pain with breathing or coughing, fever, chills and night sweats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can protect themselves against TB by getting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, but it is not generally not on the vaccination schedule in the US due to the low risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Florida Department of Health said that a member of Dillard High School in Broward County (pictured) with active tuberculosis was recently present on campus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tuberculosis, also called TB, is a fatal illness caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria and mainly affects the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If infected, patients are asked to remain isolated and must take antibiotics for six months to treat TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people become infected with TB germs that live in the body for years without causing illness. This is known as inactive TB or latent TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However without treatment, one in 10 people with inactive TB will get sick with active TB disease, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:35:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQekVjMnJBc0lJbU9QaVU4TjdmWm5UOHJNVVNtalZhc3owWjdRZzdWZW1FWWhZcW9hRGZIaEZMMWpGZElZUnNmbXYyMHFQSzZFOGpSNzlUREdnbEM2QW5nQnA5MlpvU1ROTEdmWGdlaGY3MzJIWEZUMXhkTUcwT0JDQS1GTlBwcVBnUTRBclFJTHVIUUhIQWRHYWlIVzRqZXlCcUVPQ3BRV2_SAa4BQVVfeXFMTVhmWlRTVUg4QlV2MUFxcVpZOWVPZ09UVFFNaHMwcHFvOEpHOVhUblI4UjFEX0lCT0kwYi12QjF6MlJnWjRpOTZXclV2ZzJ2WURxYU9CX0cyaUxGU01LajlFSFhxQnJreTEwbW9EN1YyNXpzZS1MYktoM2pjbVdQa3RGZ0ZoRkJYcXpRR0lMT18xWnpPZjF3Tmh2UTg3d3hQWUh3SUdmNi0zRHA2dEtB</guid></item><item><title>难以制作可可和辣椒？科学家炮制万无一失的解决方案-泰晤士报 | Struggling to make cacio e pepe?

However, the researchers said this was an inadequate method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Preparing cacio e pepe successfully depends on getting the balance just right, particularly the ratio of starch to cheese,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The concentration of starch plays a crucial role in keeping the sauce creamy and smooth, without clumps or separation. If the starch content is less than 1 per cent of the cheese weight, the sauce is prone to separating into unpleasant clumps. The pasta water alone does not contain enough starch to stabilise the sauce effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Their solution? Use a powdered starch, such as cornflour or potato starch, instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For example, for two people, the researchers recommended mixing 5g of starch with 50ml of water before heating it in a pan until almost clear. Then add 100ml of cool water, mix again, before adding 200g of grated cheese and a good grind of black pepper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.5"&gt;&lt;div id="48f30e4e-14c5-4677-9fb9-c6864a43ea3d"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Crouch said that 200g for two people was more than an entire block of pecorino from Tesco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;JACK TAYLOR FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Meanwhile, cook 300g pasta in slightly salted water until it is al dente. Save some of the pasta cooking water before draining. Once the pasta has been drained, let it cool down for up to a minute to prevent the excessive heat from destabilising the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Finally, mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding ­reserved pasta water as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Daniel Busiello, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, said when cheese was heated, its proteins changed their configuration and began to aggregate or clump together. Starch, he said, helped prevent this by binding to the proteins and reducing the chance of them sticking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers ran several experiments to find the perfect cheese-to-water ratio, using different concentrations of starch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.11"&gt;&lt;div id="41744620-4d4f-4835-9bef-f24ca8f36502"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Crouch using cornflour in the sauce while preparing the dish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;JACK TAYLOR FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They also consumed a huge amount of cheese. Dr Ivan Di Terlizzi, another co-author of the paper, told The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/29/physicists-find-key-to-perfect-pasta-but-not-how-mamma-used-to-make-it" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; that the team consumed about 6kg of cheese for the study. He said: “Although we are still not tired of this delicious dish, one of the authors had blood tests showing very high cholesterol levels. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/27de6d5c-d6d6-4682-be58-21fa3f18a68f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;price of science&lt;/a&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, not everyone is convinced. Antonio Alderuccio, an Italian chef based in &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/london-food-drink" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, said: “I’m not sure I’d try the scientists’ recipe. I’m sure it works but I believe you can get a smooth sauce without going to these lengths. The key is properly grating the cheese and using really fresh pecorino — it incorporates much more easily. The sauce only splits if you add too much water. You’ll need about half an average-sized glass for 300g of pasta.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Taste test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I must admit, I’m more of a by-eye cook than a technical one — an instinct I surely inherited from my Italian nonna, who never measured anything, Giulia Crouch writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’m too lazy to weigh ingredients — it takes the fun out of cooking. But some recipes demand precision, and the Roman classic cacio e pepe is definitely one of them. My usual trick is to reserve plenty of pasta water so I can tweak the sauce’s consistency at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But since these scientists went to all this trouble I thought I’d try their version. The method is relatively straightforward, though I can’t say the starchy slurry looked appetising as it bubbled away on the hob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.19"&gt;&lt;div id="827d06a5-d1f4-4ed0-ab37-ebadb0fdd0ec"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Crouch trying the finished product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;JACK TAYLOR FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What did impress me was the scientists’ generous cheese recommendation — 200g for two people, which was more than an entire block of pecorino from Tesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In their paper they write: “The amount of cheese can, of course, vary depending on personal taste. Traditionalists would insist on using only Pecorino Romano DOP but some argue that up to 30 per cent Parmigiano Reggiano DOP is acceptable, though this remains a point of debate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Naturally I went for the full 200g, throwing in a bit of Parmigiano Reggiano for good measure and because I didn’t have enough pecorino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The instruction to let the pasta cool slightly before mixing felt counterintuitive — pasta doesn’t usually like to sit around as it has a tendency to stick. And perhaps, by the time I’d grated such a gigantic mound of cheese, it had cooled a little too much. Still, once I added the cheesy starchy mix to my spaghetti, it all came together beautifully and the kitchen smelt glorious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So, how did it taste?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Well, great. But then pasta and cheese rarely disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As for the all-important matter of consistency, I’m sad to report that it wasn’t the best. I’ve definitely had silkier, more luxurious cacio e pepe in the past. Whether this is down to a flaw in the recipe or my execution, I guess we’ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:30:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNmIxUjFoS1N3V1pob3p2VHZUUDFfSWVqRDJTcmw0eG9sazJ4QU1NenZQRUF5X3JuLVg2YlJTdUExdWxrN0JnTGE0MXdpYVFtMGxyVEtlcnRlZTJ3QkhKeFIxWnhHRDM4MjZqekpYTFVYMzE3bnRTV3NqZGpiRDBKNE9zNUNhMDBRMDAxOUNTNFhUcVVq</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬的人性化汽车坐姿给孩子们带来全面的童趣- PetHelpful | Golden Retriever’s Human-Like Way of Sitting in Car Gives Total Kid Vibes - PetHelpful</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOYnB4WV9nNDJ3X3pPcDNDY1pseUpNcjF3c2l0dFU2di1YUGNMZTU0Rkxsa1lWQUNGY1ZTano2dmZ6d05jaThxSHl0bTk5X0hsT2hzZ2piRnAyR2tHTzk5NGhlcVRhbWg4WDB2djlWd1pVR3NBa0ljT2NLUE1xWm94ZGlMcUFKdEtCbXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOYnB4WV9nNDJ3X3pPcDNDY1pseUpNcjF3c2l0dFU2di1YUGNMZTU0Rkxsa1lWQUNGY1ZTano2dmZ6d05jaThxSHl0bTk5X0hsT2hzZ2piRnAyR2tHTzk5NGhlcVRhbWg4WDB2djlWd1pVR3NBa0ljT2NLUE1xWm94ZGlMcUFKdEtCbXc</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬的人性化坐在车里给孩子们带来共鸣-雅虎 | Golden Retriever's Human-Like Way of Sitting in Car Gives Total Kid Vibes - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOVDFJdURCeHpVdTk1M0o4WEJaNXBJWGRlSGV5N0IwRndQa1MwcVdJSGdlajNjNFI4U0VKT2g0alR2VkFjekxTOE9oNThjQ1VZVUdVWmtjTmMxTno5bzdna296LUlnaTJ4bEFZVVg4dUEzWHVGVFZpNkxYaXBLRncyXzFFNFdwVE0yMmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You know who loves the car?

(Another type of liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, is caused by drinking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Both conditions are the result of the body storing too much fat in the liver, said Dr. Sobia Laique, a liver doctor and the director of the Multidisciplinary MASLD Clinic at Cleveland Clinic. In people with MASH, the excess fat has started to cause inflammation, which over time can lead to scarring, or fibrosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Left untreated, it can progress to liver failure and liver cancer, Laique said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is more common in people with obesity or Type 2 diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/liver-disease/nafld-nash/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 75% of overweight people and more than 90% of people with obesity have the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s only one FDA-approved medication for MASH, called resmetirom, Laique said. However, the medication only helps about a quarter of patients and doesn’t address the underlying conditions that drive the disease. Bariatric surgery is often the recommended treatment for those who can’t resolve the condition through lifestyle changes, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This is fairly monumental and really is going to be paradigm-changing,” Laique said of the Wegovy trial results, “because at least in the pharmacotherapy space, you don’t have a comparable drug yet.” She was not involved with the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial, funded by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, included 800 patients with MASH from 37 countries. Patients either got a weekly 2.4 milligram dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, or a placebo, for 72 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial found that about 63% of patients in the semaglutide group saw a reduction in liver inflammation, compared with 34.3% of people who got a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to starting the trial, the participants also had moderate to high levels of scar tissue in the liver, known as stage 2 or 3 fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 37% of the semaglutide group saw improvements in their fibrosis, compared with 22.4% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also saw other benefits, including a 10.5% average weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said she was impressed, noting that once fibrosis has developed in patients, it’s often difficult to reverse or treat the inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s incredibly good news that semaglutide not only reduced inflammation but also that fibrosis regressed,” Spratt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said in an email that the results may offer hope for a condition with few treatment options, but added that long-term data is to determine whether the improvements from the drug will reduce liver-related complications and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These findings represent a very promising step forward in the fight against a common, progressive, and often silent disease,” McGowan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial results add to the growing list of conditions that GLP-1s —  the class of drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound — can treat &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beyond-ozempic-glp-1-drugs-promise-weight-loss-health-benefits-rcna157525" target="_blank"&gt;beyond diabetes and weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-wegovy-reduce-heart-attack-stroke-risk-rcna142534" target="_blank"&gt;to reduce heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt; in people with obesity. The agency also approved Zepbound for&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-weight-loss-drug-zepbound-sleep-apnea-rcna184916" target="_blank"&gt; obstructive sleep apnea &lt;/a&gt;in December, and Ozempic to &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-ozempic-semaglutide-as-the-only-glp-1-ra-to-reduce-the-risk-of-worsening-kidney-disease-and-cardiovascular-death-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-and-chronic-kidney-disease-302362466.html" target="_blank"&gt;treat chronic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt; in patients with Type 2 diabetes in January. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs are effective &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-may-protect-alzheimers-rcna163459" target="_blank"&gt;against Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-alcohol-addiction-latest-science-shows-rcna191015%20https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-alcohol-addiction-latest-science-shows-rcna191015%20https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-alcohol-addiction-latest-science-shows-rcna191015" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Insurance companies are often reluctant to cover the drugs for weight; however, they’ve shown willingness to cover them when approved for other conditions, such as heart disease risk and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a release Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said the FDA could make a decision on whether to approve Wegovy for MASH as early as the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA has granted the drug a priority review designation, the drugmaker said, meaning it will review the application in six months, rather than the standard nine-month window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Spratt noted that side effects can be a barrier for some who want to take Wegovy and similar weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The drug was well tolerated, according to the trial results. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting. Side effects leading to people dropping out of the trial were 2.6% for the semaglutide group and 3.3% for the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Laique questioned whether patients would continue to see improvement after 72 weeks. She also noted that patients would likely have to continue taking the medication, or risk MASH coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s significant weight loss, but then is it also durable weight loss?” she said. “And I think that’s the part people often forget about obesity management, it’s two battles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:04:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPRS1lMUJXd3o0RmMtVm01d216Zm1rZGRqUW5hOGkyQTRXR0RBc2xHUG9QUXZHMmVWUlFBVzlCQ1dnZVdqYWoyS09aVzdiRmlTSzNkRTNIbGVoa2hvWkcxYUt3RUxiTnVxVWtFZ190VWF5QVp1RUVUV3A1d1FFTmcxVFl4RTNIcmcwVmhUWm9nZE1Od3lSQnZLZDFEU0NCYkQteUs0QlVORElRaENYVkpUUUlFOXRaNGPSAVZBVV95cUxOeDNwbll4ajdNVVZIOXpuQXZNOTAwOXFLZl9wTWtZRy1VSmw5a2cyLTlyUmRTXzF3MlJneXRHWGpOYl9fejRiMUhkVk1oR0oxS1RYempQZw</guid></item><item><title>长期COVID具有独特的症状，在流感，肺炎中未见持久性，研究表明- CIDRAP | Long COVID has unique symptoms, persistence not seen in flu, pneumonia, research suggests - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPZXRFNllicXNrOXEzOU9GX18tRHhpZ0JmUTg1Vk8yQVhNX2NveENnNWtjUU1DNHpaQmNGSzJMZDA3WkNUdkNFYUxnNW9iMnZUSnBqc1FrQWxGODFHVmItdlNXbHhxRlRWQWF3OV8zN3BRU0g5N0VsVHM4V3ZJa0VKZDdkTW1PdHNzVVJqLTZJblM2NlR5RjA5aVZFWTIxbzZ0cGhpUzhuS1FSOXlBZUxGSUZYNFJkZ3NReEFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Post-COVID symptoms, prevalence, and time to resolution are different from those seen after flu or pneumonia, better characterizing long COVID, University of Texas investigators say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; health claims data from Medicare Advantage–covered and commercially insured US adults diagnosed as having symptomatic COVID-19 in 2020 (121,205 patients) and similar groups with flu (20,844) and pneumonia (29,052) diagnosed before the pandemic. Symptoms were evaluated 1, 3, and 6 months after post-diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings were published yesterday in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over time, only most severe cases still caused symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After 1, 3, and 6 months post-diagnosis, the odds ratios [ORs] of any symptom in the flu cohort relative to the COVID-19 group were 0.77, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively. In contrast, the respective ORs among pneumonia patients were 2.24, 2.41, and 2.46, meaning more than double the risk at those points in time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most common symptoms persisting beyond 4 weeks post-infection among COVID-19 patients were fatigue (25.4%), shortness of breath (24.7%), and joint pain (24.7%). Among flu patients, the most common symptoms were joint pain (19.8%), fatigue (18.2%), and cough (17.7%). In the pneumonia group, shortness of breath (42.2%), fatigue (34.8%), and cough (33.9%) were noted most often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The odds of having any symptom didn't differ significantly between illness severity levels 4 and 3, but the ORs for severity levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 were 1.12, 1.16, 1.46, and 2.64 times those for severity level 3, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With increasing time since diagnosis, only the most severe infections (severity levels 7 and 8) continued to cause symptoms. For level 7, the OR of having a symptom versus level 3 was 1.19 and 1.10 after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Likewise, the level-8 OR was 1.84 and 1.53 at the same time points. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Underlying medical conditions resulted in higher odds for all time points and comorbidities. The chronic conditions with the greatest increased odds of symptoms after 4 weeks were rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 2.15), ischemic heart disease (OR, 1.80), and asthma (OR, 1.80).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnitude of odds waned, but trend persisted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, relative to patients aged 80 and older, the odds of any symptom after 4 weeks were lower for all age-groups except for 70 to 79 years, which was not statistically different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We found differences in the prevalence of symptoms as well as different times to resolution better characterizing 'long COVID' and identifying that this persistence of symptoms is unique to COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After controlling for demographic factors and chronic conditions, the likelihood of a diagnosis of anxiety, brain fog, fatigue, and shortness of breath after 1, 3, and 6 months rose along with COVID-19 severity. The probability of fatigue for severity level 8 after 4 weeks was 3.32 times that for level 3, and the OR of shortness of breath was 3.07. Over time, the magnitude of ORs ebbed but maintained the trend. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The northeastern United States saw the highest rates of all lingering COVID-19 symptoms, except for headache, for which it had the lowest rates. White patients were more likely to have anxiety or fatigue than their Asian, Black, and Hispanic peers. Hispanic patients were the least likely to have persistent abnormal heart rhythms, brain fog, and shortness of breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We found that COVID-19 symptomology could not be perfectly described by previously seen influenza or pneumonia symptomology," the study authors concluded. "We found differences in the prevalence of symptoms as well as different times to resolution better characterizing 'long COVID' and identifying that this persistence of symptoms is unique to COVID-19."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Fitzgerald said &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/introduction-to-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;hot flashes are one of the most commonly reported symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of perimenopause and menopause. "A hot flush or flash is caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly changes in estrogen levels. During perimenopause, estrogen levels fluctuate much like a rollercoaster, which can lead to temperature dysregulation and trigger hot flashes. After menopause, when there is a steep decline in estrogen levels, hot flashes often continue but may become less frequent over time," she explained.&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Irregular periods and night sweats are other &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" target="_blank"&gt;common symptoms of perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. "Hot flushes are an example of vasomotor symptoms. Other symptoms include brain fog, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, joint aches and pains, muscle pain, dry eyes or hair, tinnitus, vaginal dryness, rescues libido, weight gain, reduced energy levels," Fitzgerald said, adding that people may experience all, some, or none of these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

"A hot flush or flash is caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly changes in estrogen levels. During perimenopause, estrogen levels fluctuate much like a rollercoaster, which can lead to temperature dysregulation and trigger hot flashes. After menopause, when there is a steep decline in estrogen levels, hot flashes often continue but may become less frequent over time," she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Irregular periods and night sweats are other &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:common symptoms of perimenopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;common symptoms of perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. "Hot flushes are an example of vasomotor symptoms. Other symptoms include brain fog, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, joint aches and pains, muscle pain, dry eyes or hair, tinnitus, vaginal dryness, rescues libido, weight gain, reduced energy levels," Fitzgerald said, adding that people may experience all, some, or none of these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the lesser-known symptoms shared by the TikTokers above, people may also experience &lt;a href="https://myacare.com/blog/12-perimenopause-symptoms-that-no-one-talks-about-and-how-to-deal-with-them" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:burning mouth syndrome, nipple discharge, and hormonal acne;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;burning mouth syndrome, nipple discharge, and hormonal acne&lt;/a&gt;. Fitzgerald said Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is one of the most effective options when it comes to helping stabilize estrogen levels to diminish symptoms like hot flashes. "However, some people cannot have hormones or do not want to have hormones," she then emphasized that you should always consult your physician to figure out what may be the best option for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fitzgerald has provided some resources if you want to further educate yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womens-health-concern.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/02-WHC-FACTSHEET-CBT-WOMEN-FEB-2023-A.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Women's Health Concern Fact Sheet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Women's Health Concern Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://zeg-berlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MRS_USA.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Menopause Symptom Checker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Menopause Symptom Checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rockmymenopause.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:General Menopause Information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;General Menopause Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://informd.ie/menopause" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Her Menopause Website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Her Menopause Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladybitespodcast?igsh=Z2gxdzgxMmtnaGNr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Her Women's Health Podcast ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Her Women's Health Podcast &lt;/a&gt;(Specifically &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5wJgyEv13fEMXjbxnklIcJ?si=BJIg49VAQ1GomeGjQx8JBA&amp;amp;nd=1&amp;amp;dlsi=a298d9b68a89430d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this episode;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7shINN42wkLftZ3lWowE30?si=HA1fX0WwQu64-wpks7K4vA&amp;amp;nd=1&amp;amp;dlsi=1fd368b218ff434c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this episode;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/noradominick/naomi-watts-first-time-sex-billy-crudup-menopause" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Naomi Watts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Naomi Watts&lt;/a&gt; is also a big advocate for menopause education.

The term perimenopause wasn't even known. I mean, my doctor wasn't using it.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The groundbreaking move offered a rare and powerful opportunity to see dementia developing in human brain cells. Experts said the new way of studying the disease could make it easier to test new drugs and boost the chances of finding ones that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dementia presents a big threat to health and social care systems across the world. The number of people affected is forecast to triple to nearly 153 million by 2050, which underlines why finding new ways to study the disease and speed up the search for treatments is a health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the study, scientists and neurosurgeons in Edinburgh teamed up to show for the first time how a toxic form of a protein linked to Alzheimer’s, amyloid beta, can stick to and destroy vital connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Tiny fragments of healthy brain tissue were collected from cancer patients while they were undergoing routine surgery to remove tumours at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b8c69be-6cd6-43cb-a6e9-4944996e5fa2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Living brain tissue cultures are placed inside an incubator set at 37C to mimic body temperature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists dressed in scrubs were stationed in operating theatres alongside surgical teams, ready to receive the healthy brain tissue, which would otherwise have been discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Once the pieces of brain were retrieved, scientists put them in glass bottles filled with oxygenated artificial spinal fluid before jumping into taxis to transport the samples to their lab a few minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We pretty much ran back to the lab,” said Dr Claire Durrant, a Race Against Dementia fellow and UK Dementia Research Institute emerging leader at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There, samples were sliced into thin pieces, less than a third of a millimetre thick, and laid out in small dishes. Each piece of living brain tissue was kept in a nutrient-rich liquid, inside an incubator at 37C to mimic body temperature. “And then we start experiments almost straight away,” Durrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fragments of human brain were kept alive in dishes for up to a fortnight, with the patient’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers extracted the toxic form of amyloid beta from people who died from Alzheimer’s disease and then applied it to the healthy living brain tissue in their dishes. “We’re trying to mimic Alzheimer’s disease,” said Durrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="24dbd054-ad95-4f99-a061-759dc717918c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;From left: Dr Claire Durrant, Sir James Dyson and Sir Jackie Stewart.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Douglas Robertson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike when exposed to a normal form of the protein, the brain did not attempt to repair damage caused by the toxic form of amyloid beta, her team found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even small changes in natural levels of amyloid beta – increasing or decreasing – were enough to disrupt brain cells. This suggests that the brain requires a finely tuned sweet spot of the protein to function properly, Durrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working alongside the neurosurgical team at the University of Edinburgh, we have shown that living human brain slices can be used to explore fundamental questions relating to Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alzheimer’s attacks synapses and their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Durrant’s team also found that brain slices taken from the temporal lobe, a region known to be affected early in Alzheimer’s, released higher levels of tau, another key disease protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This may explain why this part of the brain is particularly vulnerable in early Alzheimer’s, as increased tau release may enable toxic forms of this protein to spread faster between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research was backed by Race Against Dementia, a charity formed by Sir Jackie Stewart after his wife’s dementia diagnosis, and a £1m donation from the James Dyson Foundation, a charity supporting medical research and engineering education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dyson said the breakthrough represented progress “towards solving one of the most devastating problems of our time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working with brain surgeons and their consenting patients to collect samples of living human brain and keep them alive in the lab is a groundbreaking method,” he said. “It allows researchers to better examine Alzheimer’s disease on real human brain cells rather than relying on animal substitutes, such as mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tara Spires-Jones, group leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, hailed the important development. Seeing early Alzheimer’s in real-time provided a new tool for scientists to better understand the disease and how to treat it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She said: “The use of living human tissue samples generously donated by people undergoing surgery to remove brain tumours allows scientists to probe how living human brain reacts to toxic proteins produced in Alzheimer’s, and in future will allow testing of whether new treatments are effective in human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVEFxT2NpaWRVWm5GM3BwWFU0Z21lYnBfcTFQY0l4bjM1d01JbGZUQXFHQi1sVXA5eEdvRktoRkYxWkg1Q24yZDJySzA0UzBHNEpDZmVIZDJvYzlkTXo0MGttWkhBdjQ0bndwYnZ1dkpPbEZ0dnZneEZzNW5HaWxOenFBZVd4UjdDandkNXhtLWZ0Q0dDUlpydDNuN2FiU3F1ank4QWpLdWlfalFUU2MweC1TUHpIUE95Q0E</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，常见的家用塑料与全球数千人死于心脏病有关- CNN | Common household plastics linked to thousands of global deaths from heart disease, study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQTWtrT043aFd4S3ROLW9pc3N2UEJ1Z0U3WVdMUnhSWHhPd2VGLVVTVUtHMXQ1bldzMlpoblpWbmdWRS13cGZ4N2ZJOWdzUGsxQVRON0F4XzVOVHFnS0tqMlItWG5NcEdtbVhaSjdFdmhuQXk5dThZeXpFRkIwdGZUblBDSXdLNDAzTWtoTGF4UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.

    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            Researchers analyzed health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys, which included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by DEHP, which is known to be connected to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20a%20positive,subclinical%20atherosclerosis%2C%20enhancing%20the%20risk" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, Trasande said.

            Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate has also been linked to birth defects, cancer and reproductive harm for men, according to California’s &lt;a href="https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;, a law that requires companies to place warning labels on products notifying consumers about chemicals’ possible health effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000p3b6mdnfg65k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers compared the exposure with death statistics collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research group that gathers global medical information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000q3b6mrvx58kr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found exposure to DEHP contributed to 356,238 deaths in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64 globally. Africa accounted for 30% of the deaths from heart disease linked to DEHP, while East Asia and the Middle East accounted for 25% of the mortality, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000r3b6mm1bfdioa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is believed to be the first global estimate of any health outcome from exposure to the DEHP, said lead study author Sara Hyman, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000s3b6mv63u81ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” Hyman said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000t3b6mllcyynix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A limitation of the research, however, stems from the use of hazard ratios the US to estimate population-attributable deaths in other countries, EWG’s Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000u3b6m0fj7a2zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000v3b6mxpdd7sf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by Trasande and his team measured the urine concentration of phthalates in more than 5,000 adults in the United States and compared those levels with the risk of early death over an average of 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000w3b6mhoxmte59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            Researchers estimated those deaths could cost the United States about $40 billion to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00103b6m15pm0pdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00113b6mev2owgaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are other tips to reduce exposure:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00123b6mw1otkhlp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ·       Use unscented lotions and laundry detergents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ·       Use cleaning supplies without scents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00143b6mivwqr2kv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ·       Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic or wood to hold and store foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00153b6m6r74bzgq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ·       Buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables instead of canned and processed versions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00163b6mi2btagjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ·       Encourage frequent handwashing to remove chemicals from hands.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ·       Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.

    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            People are exposed when they breathe contaminated air or eat or drink foods that come into contact with the plastic, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”

            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care workers who wash their uniforms at home may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitals, according to a new study led by Katie Laird of De Montfort University, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0321467&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hospital-acquired infections are a major public health concern, in part because they frequently involve antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Many nurses and health care workers clean their uniforms at home in standard washing machines, but some studies have found that bacteria can be transmitted through clothing, raising the question of whether these machines can sufficiently prevent the spread of dangerous microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers evaluated whether six models of home washing machine successfully decontaminated health care worker uniforms, by washing contaminated fabric swatches in hot water, using a rapid or normal cycle. Half of the machines did not disinfect the clothing during a rapid cycle, while one-third failed to clean sufficiently during the standard cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also sampled biofilms from inside 12 washing machines. DNA sequencing revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic+resistance+genes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;. Investigations also showed that bacteria can develop resistance to domestic detergent, which also increases their resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings suggest that many home washing machines may be insufficient for decontaminating health care worker uniforms, and may be contributing to the spread of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;-acquired infections and antibiotic resistance. The researchers propose that the laundering guidelines given to health care workers should be revised to ensure that home washing machines are cleaning effectively. Alternatively, health care facilities could use on-site industrial machines to launder uniforms to improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+safety/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patient safety&lt;/a&gt; and control the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add, "Our research shows that domestic washing machines often fail to disinfect textiles, allowing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic-resistant+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic-resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to survive. If we're serious about the transmission of infectious disease via textiles and tackling antimicrobial resistance, we must rethink how we launder what our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+workers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; wear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, schizophrenia and other mental health conditions affect 1 in 4 people in their lifetime, but the mechanisms underlying these conditions are poorly understood. New research led by researchers at the University of Bristol has linked the body's immune response with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. The study demonstrates mental health conditions might be affected by the whole body as well as changes in the brain. The findings could pave the way for better treatments of some mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The work &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03032-x" target="_blank"&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with depression or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/schizophrenia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; are treated with drugs that work on brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine. However, one in three people with these conditions do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Christina Dardani and Professor Golam Khandaker in Bristol's MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), used Mendelian randomization—a computational approach that uses &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic information&lt;/a&gt; from large datasets—to examine whether immunological proteins are likely to be involved in seven neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team looked at the relationship of 735 immune response-related proteins measurable in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+blood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human blood&lt;/a&gt; with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, Alzheimer's disease, autism, and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response-related proteins in these seven neuropsychiatric conditions. From the identified biomarkers, 20 showed potential as targets of drugs approved for other conditions. These biomarkers could potentially be used in the future for novel therapeutics in the area of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a fundamental change in the understanding of causal mechanisms for neuropsychiatric conditions. To date, causal explanations for depression and schizophrenia have been predicted by monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, but this study suggests that overactivity of the immune system could also contribute to the cause of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golam Khandaker, Professor of Psychiatry and Immunology and MRC Investigator in the Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences (PHS), said, "Our study demonstrates that inflammation in the brain and the body might influence the risk of mental health conditions. The findings challenge the centuries-old Cartesian dichotomy between the body and the mind, and suggest that we should consider &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and schizophrenia as conditions affecting the whole person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to examine biomarkers identified through &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic analysis&lt;/a&gt; using other methods. This includes research based on health records, animal studies, and proof-of-concept &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in humans, to further evaluate causality; understand precise mechanisms from inflammation to symptoms of mental health conditions; and learn more about therapeutic potential, including whether modulating immune pathways improves symptoms of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

            More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-maternal-deaths-rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;provisional data&lt;/a&gt; posted Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz700053b6m7fk65jmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That’s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz700063b6m5joujyrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz700073b6mk1ht3u91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/maternal-mortality-healthy-start-oklahoma-california-new-york-city-0aa1fa2a141ef82607026b384cc14af7" target="_blank"&gt;leading causes&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women’s worries, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz700093b6mj31ezdqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz7000a3b6mlyfzaz4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-deaths-cdc-maternal-mortality-fbb4950245b517b4f4d57517b62556d9" target="_blank"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt;. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz7000b3b6meh4zkp5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The U.S. has one of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/maternal-mortality-rates-us-europe-norway-56829d76f4469c2fd48761ed922d13e4" target="_blank"&gt;the highest&lt;/a&gt; maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/black-maternal-mortality-american-indian-hispanic-deaths-64da18fec80f8f1790aee2e9986a757e" target="_blank"&gt;wide racial disparities&lt;/a&gt; in such deaths, with Black women dying &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/maternal-mortality-deaths-black-white-1755a7d1b51d2098326fd651af9bb1ef" target="_blank"&gt;at a far higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than white women.

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Briana Galvan said goodbye to her father on the morning of March 16, 2024, she left the hospital to run errands, comforted by the fact that he was recovering.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Westrum, 80, had recently suffered a stroke and had been admitted to M Health Fairview Southdale with shortness of breath and pneumonia just four days earlier. But his condition had improved enough that he had been moved to a step-down unit while awaiting transfer to a nursing home. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just hours later, Briana received a call to come back to the hospital. When she arrived, she was not allowed into her father’s room and was directed to the chapel. There, she was told her father was dead. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable,” Briana said, “based on the condition that I saw him in that morning.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana said the hospital told her that Steven had suffered external bleeding but offered no further details.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said he had bled externally, but they were not aware of what had happened yet, that they would need to do some investigation and look into it,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two months, she was left without answers. Then came the autopsy. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_1"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; The Meeting&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Steven Westrum’s death did not seem connected to an intentional act, records show the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office declined to do a forensic autopsy.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That left the autopsy, which Briana said she wanted done, to be completed by the M Health Fairview system. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hospital autopsy was completed in May 2024, Briana says she was contacted to set up a meeting to discuss the results. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana, who works in risk management, told KARE 11 she was suspicious because of the lack of answers she’d received to date, so she and her husband decided to secretly record the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business cards handed to Briana by the two hospital representatives in attendance show she met with Dr. Dan Frechette, Fairview Health Services' vice president of medical affairs at Ridges and Southdale hospitals, along with VP Adam Karlen, Fairview’s chief nursing officer. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, a bleeding event may have contributed, and so it is our responsibility to be transparent about that,” one of the men can be heard telling Briana in the recording, “and also to do what we can to try to address it from happening in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital executives explained that Steven’s IV catheter had become disconnected at some point in the afternoon, they weren’t sure when or how, and that uncapped catheter — which did not have backflow prevention — was the source of what they labeled “the bleeding event.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called the event “extremely rare” but also downplayed the known role it played in Steven’s death.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it's just so difficult to know what the impact of that was,” one of the hospital representatives said.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can't say definitively that this caused your father's death,” Briana was told in the recording. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M Health Fairview’s autopsy results also offered few answers, but one important clue. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_2"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; A Natural Death&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M Health Fairview autopsy on the body of Steven Westrum was conducted by pathologists at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first page, the anatomic cause of death is listed as “Not Identified.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of significant contributory conditions are listed, including severe coronary artery disease, hypertension and pneumonia.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood loss is not among the contributing conditions listed. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on page five, under the “Clinical Information” section, there is a notation that for Briana, screams off the page. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like reading a horror story,” she said while looking at the document. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notation reads, “He was found with an uncapped IV catheter in his arm and was lying in a pool of blood that was congealed at the edges.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the clinical finding that Steven lost so much blood it pooled beneath him, pathologists wrote, “multiple medical conditions were identified at autopsy, and correlated with clinical information, that may have contributed to his death.”  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They concluded, “Taken together, these findings do not point to an acute or specific cause of death.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autopsy listed Steven’s manner of death as “Natural.”&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_3"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; The Death Certificate&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after she met with the hospital executives, on May 30, 2024, Briana received another call, this time from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This call would completely change her understanding of her father’s death. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME’s office was preparing her father’s death certificate and wanted to go over the case and the wording. Briana was told the official cause of death was exsanguination — a severe loss of blood — due to a catheter mishap. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana was told for the first time that her father did not die from a natural combination of his underlying health conditions. She, instead, was told he conclusively bled to death in his hospital bed.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unbelievable, unbelievable,” she said. “There’s nothing natural about this, nothing!” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike what Briana had been told by M Health Fairview, records kept by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner show their investigator was immediately informed by the hospital on the day Steven died that he had “exsanguinated … due to an uncapped IV.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME investigator's narrative shows that Dr. Christopher Aronson with Fairview Southdale Hospital called the ME’s office on March 16, 2024, to report the death. He said that “a lab tech went into the decedent’s room to draw blood and found the decedent unresponsive with a pool of blood on the floor next to his bed.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was estimated that Steven had lost “about 4 liters of blood.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal hospital notes later obtained by Briana show staff wrote, “There was a large amount of blood on the left side of the patient's body and a large pool of blood underneath the patient's bed, which was apparently congealed at the edges and dried (did not wet the tip of glove).” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_4"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; 'Smacks of protectionism'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human body only holds about five liters of blood,” says Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who previously served as the president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At KARE 11’s request, Dr. Weedn reviewed all of the hospital medical and autopsy records, along with the ME’s reports. He said in his opinion the autopsy “smacks of protectionism of the hospital.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s significant when you see that four liters of blood was lost?” KARE 11 asked. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yes,” Weedn responded, “Four liters of blood is clearly a lethal event. There is absolutely no mystery about what caused Mr. Westrum’s death. He definitely died from blood loss.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana has since hired attorney Jeff Montpetit and is preparing to file a medical malpractice lawsuit against M Health Fairview. Montpetit called the case “the most deviant thing I have ever seen in my history as a lawyer.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_5"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; A Mistake&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to KARE 11’s investigation, M Health Fairview declined an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after repeated questioning by KARE 11 about the details of its autopsy, the hospital system did an about-face. It admitted it was a mistake for the manner of death to have been listed as “natural.” The hospital system also pledged it would be changed to "Accidental."&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KARE 11 made the editorial decision to publish their lengthy statement in full: &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Westrum and regret the circumstances surrounding his death. While adverse events are rare, we recognize that even one is too many. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to be clear: our care team communicated with Mr. Westrum’s family about the IV catheter disconnection and visible bleeding following the incident. These details were documented in the medical record, discussed with the family, included in the hospital’s autopsy narrative, and reported to regulatory bodies. We take every incident seriously, and this highly unusual complication was no exception. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hospital autopsy report listed the cause of death as “not identified” and the manner of death as “natural.” After further review, we acknowledge that this classification may not fully reflect the circumstances surrounding the event. Based on the clinical context, a classification of “undetermined” or “accidental" may have been more appropriate. The classification in the autopsy report had no bearing on our response to this incident. It did not impact our disclosure process with the family, reporting it through appropriate oversight and safety reporting channels, or our extensive analysis of the event and corrective action plans developed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was not an attempt to mislead or conceal what occurred. Rather, it reflects the reality that over 95% of hospital deaths are classified as natural, while non-natural classifications are uncommon. Our chief of pathology has reviewed this case and will share additional training and process updates across the pathology team as part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, learning, and patient safety. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Westrum wanted his ashes spread in a place he loved to visit: Copper Harbor, Michigan.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, Briana plans to honor that wish, embarking on a final journey with her father, who, even at 80 years old and in failing health, she believes died too soon.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He bled out externally — almost all the blood in his body over a period of time,” she said, “and no accountability for that.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;

lucid dreaming&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a vivid sleep state, it's actually a whole other state of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucid dreaming occurs when a person becomes aware they are dreaming, often gaining the ability to control the dream’s events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, they might fly, walk through walls, or confront fears, taking advantage of the limitless possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, scientists believed lucid dreams were simply more vivid or intense versions of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14078587/dreams-scientist-bizarre-sleep-paralysis-lucid.html"&gt;the typical dreams that occur during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which is a normal phase of the sleep cycle characterized by increased brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this new study shows that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14590121/Jaw-dropping-scan-shows-mouse-brain-youve-never-seen-before.html"&gt;brain activity patterns&lt;/a&gt; during a lucid dream are entirely different from those that occur during regular dreams and wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patterns reflect changes in how brain regions activate and communicate, linked to shifts in perception, memory, self-awareness, and cognitive control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, they found that lucid dreaming was associated with reduced beta brain waves (which are linked to waking consciousness and alertness) in two different brain regions that control spatial awareness, sense of touch and self-perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, gamma waves, which indicate heightened focus and consciousness, increased in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in self-referential thinking and metacognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings suggest lucid dreaming is a unique neural state, offering new insights into consciousness and potential applications in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have discovered that lucid dreaming is more than just a vivid sleep state, it's actually a whole other state of consciousness &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself,' said lead researcher Çağatay Demirel, of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This work offers a perspective that could challenge the traditional binary view of sleep and wakefulness in future research,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demirel and his colleagues compiled an enormous amount of data from previous sleep studies — which measured brain activity with EEGs — into what they believe is now the largest dataset in this field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then compared brain activity patterns for wakefulness, REM sleep and lucid dreaming to determine what makes each state unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the surface level, brain activity during lucid dreaming did not look all that different from REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the researchers dove deeper to look at the sources of electrical signals in the brain, key differences began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reduction in beta waves associated with lucid dreaming was isolated to the right temporal lobe (which controls spatial awareness and nonverbal memory) and the parietal lobe (which controls the senses and self-perception).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beta waves are high-frequency brain waves that are typically associated with a wakeful state. They are involved in conscious thought and logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucid dreams are dreams where the dreamer is aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control what happens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggest that this reduction could signal the brain's process of recognizing that the dream is not real, thereby allowing the dreamer to become aware that they are dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found an increase in gamma waves in the right precuneus, which plays an important role in spatially guided behavior and imagining one's own actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This surge of gamma activity coincided with the moment the dreamer realizes they are dreaming, suggesting that it may further reflect the brain's process of becoming lucid while sleeping.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that these patterns of brain activity are totally unique to lucid dreaming, indicating that it is its own state of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But perhaps more interestingly, they also found that these patterns are most similar to the brain activity associated with the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like lucid dreams, these psychedelic experiences are also associated with activity changes in the precuneus, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But 'While psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and decreased self-referential processing . . . lucid dreams may actually harness elements of self-awareness &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and control,' Demirel they wrote in their report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team published their findings in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/03/27/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025"&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lucid dreams can occur spontaneously, but you can also train yourself to have them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers have identified several techniques that can help you induce a lucid dream. But the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, also known as the 'MILD' technique, is among the most effective, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams/lucid-dreams"&gt;SleepFoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's designed to be used when you wake up in the middle of the night, and involves four basic steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, upon awakening, try to recall what you have been dreaming about or the details of a dream you just had that you'd like to reenter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, identify signs from the dream that will help you realize that you're dreaming once you reenter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Say the words: 'When I begin dreaming, I will remember that I'm dreaming.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then continue recalling the dream content and repeating that phrase until you fall back asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This technique is more effective for some people than others, but it tends to result in lucid dreaming 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:37:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>年轻人的肠癌发病率正在上升-《经济学人》 | Rates of bowel cancer are rising among young people - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPUzlvRjZHa2xQRi1DNkd5YkJtdDRYcXNZdmstR3pHX0RNekgtLU5VUlBzWkN1clMtN21ETENpbGJ1NDFzVjBJSHU2RVRXdjRmcHBCcVB1aFY1MllvSnFDeXhhSnNMcFlYX0czRTdsd29jb3prYW5IeG1MRGg4bzQ5TmhXYkoza2tyclZoam5rSTdPNklSMERHcHlBcGlKb3M0VG5MclNud09hcmdBR0JSSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-p6fe6o efq1yh21"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;T EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS&lt;/small&gt; across the world, patients are presenting with undiagnosed cancers at an advanced stage.

&lt;p&gt;In the years since legalization, there has been a tremendous surge in the &lt;a href="https://www.doingbusinesswithocs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OCS-By-the-Numbers-Data-Report-2023.pdf"&gt;number of cannabis products&lt;/a&gt; available to Canadian consumers, many offering tailored experiences to enhance seemingly any mood or activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want something calming or uplifting? Are you looking to inspire focus, spark creativity or get a good night’s sleep? Do you prefer full-spectrum extracts or THC isolates? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does one plant produce so many different experiences? Like many of its botanical relatives, cannabis is rich in active compounds. The prevailing view is that these compounds work together to shape the overall experience, a phenomenon known as the “entourage effect.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a consumer standpoint, the idea of custom-tailored experiences guided by key active ingredients is appealing — and it certainly makes things easier. But in reality, it’s not so cut-and-dried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making informed decisions as a cannabis consumer can seem overwhelming, and navigating a product menu can feel like it requires a chemistry degree. But how much do we really know about how cannabis works? And how well are we able to predict individual experiences based on a product’s composition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s in a high?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most research into cannabis’ effects has focused on two key compounds, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.12.022"&gt;Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)&lt;/a&gt;. CBD is non-intoxicating and thought to underlie many therapeutic effects of cannabis, whereas THC is the primary compound responsible for the classic cannabis high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the most pertinent information available to cannabis consumers was the THC:CBD ratio, and from a regulatory standpoint, these are the only compounds required by &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/regulations-support-cannabis-act.html"&gt;Health Canada&lt;/a&gt; for product labels. But the cannabis plant produces over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26092774"&gt;500 potentially bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, most notably cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids, with increasing emphasis being placed on how they interact to drive different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that the different components of cannabis work in concert, modulating one another’s activity to influence the overall experience, has been termed the “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x"&gt;entourage effect&lt;/a&gt;.” Simply put, it seeks to explain the effects of cannabis beyond those of any individual component, such as THC or CBD, and offers an elegant explanation for a common question: how can products with the same amount of THC and CBD produce different effects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the medical cannabis community has long-favoured full- and broad-spectrum products (those containing a varied chemical profile) over single-compound isolates such as purified THC or CBD, based on claims of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/can.2021.0114"&gt;superior safety and efficacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask your local budtender for a recommendation and you will likely get a crash-course on terpene nomenclature, hearing words like limonene, myrcene, pinene and linalool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this modern embrace of terpene pharmacology and natural product chemistry reflects a growing appreciation for the complexities of the cannabis plant, claims of entourage effects remain largely speculative, highlighting how much we’ve yet to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/655812/original/file-20250317-56-b0zgdq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Tijana Martin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sound science or smoke and mirrors?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00392-6"&gt;Initially coined by scientists in Israel and Italy&lt;/a&gt; in study published in 1998, the term “entourage effect” described interactions among endogenous cannabinoids (THC-and CBD-like molecules produced by the human body). The idea was that some of these compounds, which are inactive on their own, could enhance or modulate the activity of others, resulting in combined effects greater than the sum of their parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this study did not examine plant-derived cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, but rather structurally related compounds produced naturally in the brain and body. As such, the idea of cannabis-specific entourage effects did not emerge directly from the data itself, but from broader inferences drawn from that research that provided a rationale for the diverse effects often reported by cannabis users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, and despite a lack of supporting evidence, the term has been widely adopted and adapted by the cannabis industry, often leveraged to differentiate products in an overly crowded market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available support for entourage effects in humans is limited to a few small clinical and observational studies and meta-analyses that suggest whole-plant extracts may outperform isolates for conditions like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.091414"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2002-2119"&gt;pediatric epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these studies often use non-standardized extracts and are therefore unable to identify which chemical interactions are driving the effects. Further, direct comparisons of full-spectrum and isolate products are lacking, with most claims rooted in inferences made from pre-clinical (in other words, non-human) research and from studies of non-cannabis derived phytomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the entourage effect is a valid hypothesis and arguably the most promising in terms of explaining cannabis’s varied and nuanced effects. Similar effects have been described for other drug classes, though these interactions are often termed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1549"&gt;synergism and potentiation&lt;/a&gt; and typically involve just a few well-characterized compounds. In contrast, unlocking cannabis synergy requires untangling the interactions of hundreds of different molecules, many of which are still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That complexity is what I’ve spent my career trying to understand. Researching how cannabis-derived compounds work in the brain and body, I have gained a considerable appreciation for how far our understanding of cannabis has come, how much we have still yet to uncover and how easy it is for enthusiasm to outpace evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/655815/original/file-20250317-56-n2p7x5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reading between the product lines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the cannabis industry continues to evolve, consumers need to approach product claims with a healthy dose of skepticism. There is no doubt the cannabis plant is a treasure trove of unexplored and underexplored bioactive molecules, and that we will continue to uncover interesting and unexpected interactions among them. But we are far from a complete picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the entourage effect remains a hypothesis more often co-opted for marketing than grounded in evidence. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong, but it does mean we should resist conflating convenient narratives with established science. This highlights an important question: where does the onus of responsibility for generating this new knowledge fall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the cannabis industry continues invoking the entourage effect for marketing and product differentiation, then it should support and contribute to research that furthers the state of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying solely on existing pre-clinical and academic studies in lieu of directly advancing the science and validating real-world product claims risks perpetuating hype at the expense of credibility. But industry is not alone in their duty. Government must also remedy the regulatory bottlenecks that impede new research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a credible, science-backed cannabis marketplace means moving beyond hype. It requires action, from industry and government, to generate the information consumers need to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to recognize and distinguish unpleasant from pleasant interactions is essential for humans to navigate their social environment,” says Xiaoting Wu, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now, it has been unclear how the brain assigns positivity or negativity—‘valence’—to social experiences, and how that information can be flexibly updated in a constantly changing environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of this complex neural circuitry is the hippocampus, located deep in the temporal lobe of the brain and responsible for forming new memories, learning, and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai researchers described how two neuromodulators—serotonin and neurotensin, which influence processes such as mood, arousal, and neural plasticity—are released into the hippocampal subregion known as ventral CA1, where they control opposing social valence assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both neurotransmitters impact distinct populations of ventral CA1 neurons through their respective receptors, serotonin 1B and neurotensin 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While deficits in social valence are known to be prevalent in many neuropsychiatric disorders, their underlying neural mechanisms and pathophysiology have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through our work we’ve provided the first foundational insights into the neural basis of social valence,” notes Dr. Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have demonstrated that the neuromodulators serotonin and neurotensin signal opposing valence, revealing a fundamental principle of brain function in the form of a neuromodulatory switch that allows behavioral adaptation based on social history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team developed a novel social cognitive paradigm that involved exposing mice to negative and positive social encounters. In the negative social encounter, the test mouse was exposed to a mean/aggressive mouse; in the positive encounter, the mouse was exposed to a potential mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both assays the mice had negative or neutral/positive or neutral interaction and then got to choose which mouse they would like to spend more time with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without prior experience, the mice did not have a preference, but with the experience, they associated a mouse with a positive or negative valence and then learned to avoid the “bad” mouse or approach the “good” mouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, the team uncovered specific drug targets for positive and negative valence, knowledge that could potentially factor into future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, serotonin acting on the serotonin 1B receptor generates a positive impression of a social encounter, while neurotensin acting on the neurotensin 1 receptor creates a negative impression. Imbalanced emotional processing of those two social experiences is known to be a debilitating symptom of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, by activating the serotonin 1B receptor, researchers were able to restore a positive impression associated with rewarding social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a specific neuromodulator receptor which we then targeted to rescue social cognitive deficits in a mouse model of ASD,” Dr. Wu explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a broader scale, our work provides critical insights into complex social behaviors while revealing potential therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to improve social cognitive deficits in common neuropsychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by funding from NIH K99 Career Development Award (grant no.
