First, measure out 5m (16.5ft), followed by another 10m. To get started, it's recommended to walk for 5m to get up to your normal speed, then walk at your normal pace for 10m.

With this test, measure out 1m (3.3ft), followed by 4m. The idea is to use the first metre to get up to speed, then time how long it takes to walk for 4m at your usual pace. To work out your speed, divide four metres by the number of seconds it took you to walk that distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-2d378821-0 duQDIB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-1 dBCBSi"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-2d378821-3 djFilw"&gt;Find out how you compare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-2 bjvxgb"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For an idea of how you compare to other people, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820535/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;average walking speed&lt;/a&gt; of a 40-49 woman is 1.39m/s (4.6ft/s), and 1.43m/s (4.7ft/s) for a 40-49-year-old man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If you are aged 50-59, then the average walking speed is 1.31m/s (4.3ft/s) for a woman, and 1.43m/s (4.7ft/s) for a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For 60-69 year-olds, average gait speed falls to 1.24m/s (4.1ft/s) for a woman, and 1.43m/s (4.7ft/s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For 70-79 year-olds, average walking speed is 1.13m/s (3.7ft/s) for a woman, and 1.26m/s (4.16ft/s) for a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Finally, for 80-89 year-olds, gait speed is around 0.94m/s (3.1ft) for a woman, and 0.97m/s (3.2ft/s) for a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Alternatively, there are many apps you can use to measure your walking speed, including fitness trackers like Walkmeter, MapMyWalk, Strava, and Google Fit, which use GPS to track distance and time, allowing them to calculate your speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies have shown that gait speed is a significant predictor of life expectancy in older adults. For example, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh pooled together the results of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080184/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;nine studies&lt;/a&gt; which collectively tracked more than 34,000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older aged between six and 21 years. The study showed that that gait speed was significantly associated with lifespan. For example, men with the slowest walking speeds at age 75 had a 19% chance of living for 10 years, compared to men with the fastest walking speeds who had an 87% chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One explanation is that people who are already unwell tend to be less mobile. However a 2009 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4460" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study in France&lt;/a&gt; found that even amongst healthy adults aged over 65, participants with low walking speed were around three times more likely to die of cardiovascular disease during the study period compared with people who walked faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Walking seems like such a simple thing – most of us don't think about it, we just do it," says Line Rasmussen, a senior researcher in the department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The bodies of slower walkers age at a faster pace (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The bodies of slower walkers age at a faster pace (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But walking actually relies on many different body systems working together: your bones and muscles carry and move you, your eyes help you see where you're going, your heart and lungs circulate blood and oxygen, and your brain and nerves coordinate it all," Rasmussen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to Rasmussen, as we age, the function of these systems starts to slow down – and a slower walking speed can therefore reflect this overall decline and be a sign of advanced ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This doesn't just apply to older adults.

For example, they tended to score lower on IQ tests overall, performing worse on tests of memory, processing speed, reasoning and other cognitive functions. MRI scans also showed that this cognitive deterioration was accompanied by observable changes in the participants' brains. Slower walkers had smaller brains, a thinner neocortex – the outermost layer of the brain, which controls thinking and higher information processing – and more white matter. Intriguingly, even the faces of slow walkers were rated as ageing at a faster rate than the other participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In all, the research suggests that the bodies and brains of slow walkers age at a faster rate to those of quick walkers. There were also signs that these health differences were present from an early age, as researchers were able to predict the walking speed of 45-year-olds based on intelligence, language and motor skills tests taken when the participants were just three years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Walking more regularly can help to boost your walking speed (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Walking more regularly can help to boost your walking speed (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"What surprised me most was finding a link between how fast people walked at age 45 and their cognitive abilities all the way back in early childhood," says Rasmussen. "This suggests that walking speed is not just a sign of ageing, but also a window into lifelong brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, readers who class themselves as slow walkers needn't be too disheartened, as there are many things we can do to improve our walking speed. As part of her research to help cancer patients, Dieli-Conwright produces exercise regimes to help people recovering from chemotherapy regain their strength. Participants are advised to increase the duration and intensity of their walking exercise every three to four weeks to improve their fitness. And there are even simpler things that people can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Take any opportunity you can to walk more regularly, as remaining physically active is so important," says Dieli-Conwright. Her tips include parking further away from your destination, meeting up with friends to walk socially, or taking a pet to the local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's important to take walking breaks, especially for individuals who have a more sedentary job," says Dieli-Conwright. "Even if it's just a five-minute walking break to go to the bathroom, or a five-minute quick walk around the block – it's vital to interrupt that sitting time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQM1BnVDdVY1Nfc2VGcVNQSUV5MzB1cWM2cGJJWWg4TGhXaGxFV2VTRjBDbEk5QmVaWXdCYldKUFlKZ3lHYmJ6OEc5Z3FlcXBQdUZIQ3NDSG5HTHVycjRwa2xOWkE5cnFSU3lkSDlqMFlaWHJZOXlIWnFfczE3aV9OU0J0dXE1TnB1Z1pNZmZMX2NHdEVxcXpfdmNGWUctVnoySWc</guid></item><item><title>在现实环境中发现肥胖症注射药物可产生较小的体重减轻- Medical Xpress | Injectable medications for obesity found to produce smaller weight loss in a real-world setting - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPLWUyOThLcktJcHJNaWEtbk52bVViNEpNa0x6d1ROZ2ZnWTFsaDJwT3FnVlRaUk8wTjh1ZzdybnY4NThUbk1BRl85dDl6UnpSeUUxYkZ3RC1XZG1VNjlmaTk1TEhWU19ndnhDU0xWT3RPZzM2Y2F6VERMX251WDJ5U09kQzhhOG9pdkV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Cleveland Clinic study shows that semaglutide and tirzepatide—injectable GLP-1 drugs for obesity—produce smaller weight loss in a real-world setting because patients discontinue treatment or use lower maintenance dosages. Treatment discontinuation also negatively impacted blood sugar control in patients with prediabetes. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.24331" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the &lt;i&gt;Obesity Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hamlet Gasoyan, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a researcher with Cleveland Clinic's Center for Value-Based Care Research, said, "Our study shows that patients treated for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obesity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; with semaglutide or tirzepatide lost less weight on average in a regular clinical setting compared to what is observed in randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"According to our data, this could be explained by higher rates of discontinuation and lower maintenance dosages used in clinical practice, compared to randomized clinical trial settings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide (sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic) and tirzepatide (sold under the brand names Zepbound and Mounjaro) are FDA-approved medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of those medications, Dr. Gasoyan and colleagues studied their effect on weight reduction and blood sugar regulation (glycemic control) in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Cleveland Clinic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retrospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; included 7,881 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult patients&lt;/a&gt; with an average body mass index (BMI) greater than 39, which is classified as clinically severe obesity. Among the participants, 1,320 had pre-diabetes at the start of the study, defined by blood sugar levels between 5.7–6.4%. Patients who have pre-diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is one of the most common complications of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study participants began treatment for obesity with injectable forms of semaglutide or tirzepatide between 2021 and 2023. Researchers grouped patients who discontinued their obesity medications into those who discontinued early (within three months) and late (within three to 12 months). The study's follow-up ended in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that more than 20% of patients discontinued their medications early and 32% discontinued their medications late. In addition, more than 80% of study participants were on lower maintenance dosages of those medications (i.e., equal to or less than 1 mg for semaglutide and equal to or less than 7.5 mg for tirzepatide). The maintenance dose refers to the amount of medication needed to sustain a therapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year after the start of the treatment, researchers found that the average weight reduction was 3.6% among the participants who discontinued their treatment early, compared to 6.8% for those who discontinued their treatment late. Those who did not discontinue treatment lost on average 11.9% body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who did not discontinue treatment and were on high maintenance dosage of the medications lost 13.7% of their body weight with semaglutide and 18.0% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings about the real-world use patterns of these medications and associated clinical outcomes could inform the decisions of health care providers and their patients on the role of treatment discontinuation and maintenance dosage in achieving clinically meaningful weight reductions," said Dr. Gasoyan.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Researchers also identified what factors were associated with higher odds of achieving weight loss of 10% or more, which provides clinically significant health benefits in this patient population. Patients had higher odds of achieving 10% or greater &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+reduction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight reduction&lt;/a&gt; after one year of treatment if they:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not discontinue their medications or discontinued late (vs. early)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were on high maintenance dosage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;received tirzepatide (vs. semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were female (vs. male).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at the factors that affect a person's weight trajectory, researchers tracked glycemic control in patients who had pre-diabetes at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the participants with pre-diabetes, 33% of those who discontinued their treatment early experienced normal blood sugar levels (defined by an HbA1c level of 5.6 or lower), compared to 41% who discontinued their treatment late, and 67.9% who did not discontinue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our study, the majority of the patients with pre-diabetes experienced normal blood sugar levels when they continued their treatment," said Dr. Gasoyan. "Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common complications of obesity, so diabetes prevention is very important. This study highlights that treatment discontinuation, especially early, negatively affects both weight and glycemic control outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment included the cost of the medications and insurance coverage–related issues, side effects, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medication/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; shortages. A follow-up study is in the works to quantify why patients discontinue their obesity medications in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers observed that while patients who discontinued obesity medications lost significantly less weight compared to those who persisted, their weight trajectories remained relatively stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be studied further to identify what additional weight management methods patients are using in real world settings after discontinuation of obesity medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to boost your cardiovascular fitness, strengthen your bones and joints, and boost your mood, you might think lacing up a set of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes"&gt;best running shoes&lt;/a&gt; and heading out the door is the solution. But what if running just isn’t for you? I’ve got good news — according to NASA, rebounding is more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebounding, or bouncing on a mini trampoline, is a low-impact workout that soared in popularity in the 1980s. At the same time, NASA did a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1980.49.5.881" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1980.49.5.881" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found just 10 minutes of rebounding could be 68% more effective than a 30-minute run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight participants, aged between 19 and 26, walked and ran on a treadmill at four speeds, and jumped on a trampoline at four heights. Researchers looked at oxygen uptake, acceleration levels, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results found that trampolining put a lot less pressure on the participants’ bodies than the treadmill. What’s more, “the external work output at equivalent levels of oxygen uptake were significantly greater while trampolining than running.” Notably, “the greatest difference was about 68%.” Rebounding made the participant’s joints and muscles work harder than running did, even though their hearts and lungs were working at the same levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of oxygen consumption was also found to be twice as efficient when rebounding than treadmill running, plus recovery times were quicker. While there’s drawbacks to the research (it was conducted exclusively on men and the sample size is small), this high-intensity, low-impact form of cardio might be one to consider if you’re looking for a new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-benefits-of-rebounding"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the benefits of rebounding? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While running primarily engages the muscles in the lower body, rebounding is a full-body workout. Your legs work hard when bouncing, as does your core, which has to stabilize your body. As you jump, you’re working on your balance and coordination, as well as burning calories. If losing weight is your goal, you’ll need to ensure you’re in a calorie deficit — burning more calories than you consume. The best way to keep an eye on your calorie burn is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebounding is great for building cardio endurance, as your heart rate will skyrocket as you jump. It’s also a fun workout — there’s a reason why toddlers love bouncing on a trampoline. If you’re bored of pounding the sidewalks on your run, why not try bouncing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DJdpgACRAyKdtcYzRiNgG8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DJdpgACRAyKdtcYzRiNgG8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-started"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get started &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to try rebounding? All you’ll need is a mini trampoline and enough space around you to ensure you’re safe. Start by building up your time bouncing, and then add more dynamic moves like butt kicks, jogging, star jumps and tucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, if you’re a complete beginner or you’re recovering from an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to check with a personal trainer before trying a new exercise regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

                Justin Carlyle, age 23, photographed on the street in Kensington, a neighborhood of Philadelphia, has lived with addiction to fentanyl and other drugs for a decade. After a decade when overdoses devastated young Americans, drug deaths among people in the U.S. under age 35 are plummeting. The shift is saving thousands of young lives every year.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When Justin Carlyle, 23, began experimenting with drugs a decade ago, he found himself part of a generation of young Americans caught in the devastating wave of harm caused by fentanyl addiction and overdose.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I use fentanyl, cocaine, crack cocaine, yeah, all of it," Carlyle said, speaking to NPR on the streets of Kensington, a working class neighborhood in Philadelphia where dealers sell drugs openly. "I was real young. I was 13 or 14 when I tried cocaine, crack cocaine, for the first time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As an elevated train rumbled overhead, Carlyle described turning to fentanyl, xylazine and other increasingly toxic street drugs. "I've had three overdoses, and two of the times I was definitely Narcaned," he said, referring to a medication, also known as naloxone, that reverses potentially fatal opioid overdoses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Carlyle's teens and early 20s have been wracked by severe drug use, but the fact that he's still alive means he's part of a hopeful new national trend.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing is a massive reduction in [fatal] overdose risk, among Gen Z in particular," said Nabarun Dasgupta, an addiction researcher at the University of North Carolina. "Ages 20 to 29 lowered the risk by 47%, cut it right in half."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This stunning drop in drug deaths among people in the U.S.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is being tracked in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The latest available records found fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people (see chart) under the age of 35 in 2021. By last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses, according to provisional CDC data.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The life-saving shift is welcome news for parents like Jon Epstein, who lost his son Cal to fentanyl in 2020. "What has happened with the 20- to 29-year-olds?  They beat fentanyl," said Epstein, who works with &lt;a href="https://www.songforcharlie.org/" target="_blank"&gt;a national drug awareness group focused on young people called Song for Charlie&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70926" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

His father, Jon Epstein, and mother, Jennifer Epstein, joined a movement of activist parents in a group called Song for Charlie that works to raise awareness about the risks of fentanyl and other street drugs. Also shown is Cal's brother, Miles Epstein.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;For America's young, a decade of unprecedented carnage&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand the significance of this promising trend, it's important to recall the terror and devastation wrought by fentanyl among families and communities in the U.S.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Beginning around 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6533a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. officials say Mexican drug cartels began smuggling large quantities of fentanyl into American communities&lt;/a&gt;, often disguising the street drug as counterfeit prescription pills resembling OxyContin or Percocet.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, drug overdoses among young people surged, killing more than 230,000 people under the age of 35. For many families and whole communities, the losses felt catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We went to check on [Cal] and he was unresponsive," Jon Epstein recalled. "We made it to the hospital, but he didn't make it home. It was a bolt out of the blue."  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70970" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Cal Epstein was 18, a college student. According to the family, it's not clear why he decided to take an opioid pill. He tried to purchase a prescription-grade pill from a dealer on social media. In fact, it was a counterfeit pill containing a deadly dose of fentanyl.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While grieving, Jon Epstein started learning about fentanyl, digging through public health data. He found other kids in his town of Beaverton, Ore., were dying. "They had lost four students [to fatal overdoses in the local school district] in the preceding year," he recalled.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jon and his wife, Jennifer Epstein, connected with a growing network of shattered parents around the country who were waking up to a terrifying fact: Fentanyl, often sold on social media platforms, was making it into their homes and killing their kids.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like many grieving families, they turned their sorrow into activism. Through the group Song for Charlie, they worked to educate young people and parents about the unique dangers of fentanyl.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The game has completely changed, especially for kids who are going through an experimental phase," Jon Epstein warned in a video distributed nationally. "An experimental phase is now deadly." This message — summed up by the phrase &lt;em&gt;One pill can kill&lt;/em&gt; —  began spreading in schools and on social media nationwide but for years the wave of death seemed unsolvable.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392279/" target="_blank"&gt;study published last month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researcher Noa Krawczyk at the NYU Grossman School of Public Health found deaths attributed entirely to fentanyl "nearly quadrupled" among people people age 15 to 24 from 2018 through 2022.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In your generation, people used drugs. In my generation people used drugs, we just didn't use to die as much from them," Krawcyzk said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Especially among teenagers in the U.S., fentanyl deaths seemed stuck at catastrophic levels, between 1,500 and 2,000 fatal overdoses a year. Then last year, federal data revealed a stunning decline, with 40% fewer teens experiencing fatal overdoses. "We're super heartened to finally see teens dropping," Epstein said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the improvement is dramatic, Dasgupta at the University of North Carolina, found the recovery among teens appears uneven.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some teens and twenty-somethings are seeing far fewer deaths, but he identified one cluster born between 2005 and 2011 who actually saw a slight uptick in deaths over the past two years. The increase is relatively small — about 300 additional fatalities nationwide over two years — but Dasgupta said it's an area of concern that needs more study to determine why. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The question now is what changed that is suddenly saving so many young lives?  Drug policy experts are scrambling to understand the shift.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Many U.S. kids appear more cautious about drug use  &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theories include the wider distribution of Narcan, or naloxone; a trend of weaker, less deadly fentanyl being sold by dealers; more readily available addiction healthcare; and also the loss of so many vulnerable young people who have already died.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many researchers believe another key factor may be less risky drug and alcohol use among teens and twenty-somethings, a pattern that emerged during the years of the COVID epidemic. &lt;a href="https://monitoringthefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mtf2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;One study by a team at the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; found the number of teens abstaining from substance grew to its highest level in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This trend in the reduction of substance use among teenagers is unprecedented," Nora D. Volkow, who has served as director of the U.S. government's National Institute on Drug Abuse since 2003, said &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/reported-use-most-drugs-among-adolescents-remained-low-2024" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement last December.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keith Humphreys, an addiction researcher at Stanford University, credits this apparent behavioral shift with helping save lives. "There's fewer people initiating with these substances. That should work in our favor," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dasgupta at the University of North Carolina, years of devastation caused by fentanyl and other opioids might mean more people in their teens and twenties are choosing to experiment with less risky drugs.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Alcohol and opioids are on the outs with Gen Z, and instead we see [a shift to] cannabis and psychedelics, and those are inherently safer drugs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Overall, this positive trend among younger Americans is outpacing the wider opioid recovery in the U.S., which saw 27% fewer fatal overdoses across all age groups in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Will drug deaths keep dropping for young Americans? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While this news is promising — roughly 15,000 fewer drug deaths among young people in the U.S. in 2024, according to preliminary data, compared with the deadliest year 2021 — researchers say sustaining progress may be difficult. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because many of the young people still most at risk, like Justin Carlyle in Philadelphia, aren't just experimenting with drugs. They're struggling with full blown addiction.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I'm used to is getting high, you know?" he said.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the danger of a fatal overdose, Carlyle told NPR he has tried to quit fentanyl repeatedly, even using the medication suboxone to to try to curb his opioid cravings, so far without success.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I wish I had the answer to that. I know all of us fighting addiction right now wish we had the answer," he said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many experts, activists and front-line healthcare workers say there's more hope on the streets, too. The spread of Narcan&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is helping. Researchers studying street drugs say the fentanyl being sold by dealers in the U.S. is less potent, less deadly, than it once was.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That matters because studies show people who survive addiction long enough do typically recover.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also growing efforts around the U.S. aimed at reaching young people experiencing severe addiction, programs that ramped up over the past four years with federal funding from the Biden administration.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a recent afternoon, two city drug response workers in Philadelphia, Kevin Howard and Dominick Maurizio, offered counseling to a young man huddled in a bus shelter.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anything we can help you with? Want to go in-patient?" Howard said. "Want to go to a shelter?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70983" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Howard and Maurizio are themselves in recovery after surviving what they describe as their own battles with heroin and crack cocaine addiction when they were young men in their 20s.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both said they believe this kind of outreach is helping. "If we help one person, we're winning in some capacity," Maurizio said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I see it as me saving lives," Howard said. "Any time I give someone Narcan or just check on them to see if they're alive, I believe we're winning."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But experts point to one other uncertainty in this first hopeful moment since the fentanyl crisis began. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to cut billions of dollars in funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis. The federal government has already moved to freeze or end grants that support front-line drug treatment and harm reduction programs.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New research shows that people who take certain psychiatric medications may be more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS), which is the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which was led by a team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, raises some important questions about the connections between psychiatric symptoms, ALS, and MND, and how they might be targeted for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic"&gt;Anxiolytics&lt;/a&gt;, hypnotics and sedatives, and antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed drugs for psychiatric disorders such as anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="163907" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and sleep problems. In terms of increased ALS risk, it worked out as 34 percent, 21 percent, and 26 percent respectively for the three drug types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased risk is extremely small when taken in context with the low prevalence of ALS itself. Yet understanding these links could help improve our understanding of motor neurone disease and provide insights for specialists prescribing ways to treat common psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this case-control study, prescribed use of anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, or antidepressants was associated with a higher subsequent risk of ALS," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14437"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prediagnostic use of such medications was also associated with a poor prognosis after ALS diagnosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there's no cure for the progressive debilitation that ALS causes, as parts of the nervous system break down – leading to paralysis and, eventually, respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also identified a slight increase in rate of decline and risk of an earlier death among those diagnosed with ALS who had been exposed to one of a number of psychiatric medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163910" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163910" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart.jpg" alt="Drugs vs ALS chart" class="wp-image-163910 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart-279x415.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart-600x893.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163910" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Medications such as anxiolytics (above) can also increase the risk of mortality or need for invasive ventilation in those diagnosed with ALS. (Chourpiliadis et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used national health data in Sweden to compare 1,057 people with ALS who had been diagnosed between 2015 and 2023 with more than 5,000 controls matched for age and sex who had no MND diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also accounted for genetic and environmental factors in their analysis, further backing up the idea that the increased risk of ALS was connected to the medication – or the reasons the medications were prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The data isn't enough to show the drugs are directly causing the increase in ALS risk. It's also possible that other health-related factors are causing both the prescription of psychiatric medications, and the higher likelihood of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis"&gt;an ALS diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study adds to growing evidence that individuals with psychiatric conditions may face an elevated risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/motor-neurone-disease-linked-to-use-of-common-psychiatric-medications"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Susannah Tye, from the University of Queensland in Australia, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the implication that psychiatric medications themselves contribute to this risk should be interpreted with caution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24801"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found people with psychiatric disorders are also more at risk of developing ALS, these results may provide some much needed detail&lt;span&gt; to the overall picture of how these different conditions, and their causes and treatments, fit together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that ALS remains a rare condition, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/als/dashboard/index.html"&gt;around 9 in 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Depression and anxiety are much more common, which means millions of people take these medications to treat their mental health without ever developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time though, scientists are gradually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vigorous-physical-activity-linked-to-increased-risk-of-developing-als-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-mnd"&gt;understanding the different factors&lt;/a&gt; that affect ALS risk, which should provide clues as to how it might one day be effectively treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14437"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, histotripsy carries a lower risk of complications than ablation, in which liver tumours are destroyed by applying heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/scotland/article/shapeshifting-bowel-cancer-cells-key-to-treatment-breakthrough-kxdl0h29k" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shapeshifting bowel cancer cells key to treatment breakthrough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The technology has been approved in the UK under the innovative devices access pathway, a process overseen by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is designed to allow faster approvals of potentially transformative medical devices that address urgent unmet needs and have evidence of safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wes Streeting, the health secretary, who authorised early access to the technology, said: “By cutting red tape we’ve allowed this non-invasive, life-saving treatment to reach patients years earlier than planned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Liver cancer incidence across the UK has surged by more than 40 per cent over the past decade, according to the charity Liver Cancer UK, fuelled by harmful levels of alcohol consumption, rising obesity rates and the growing prevalence of hepatitis infections. There are now about 6,000deaths each year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has one of the lowest survival rates out of all cancer types and is showing one of the fastest increases in mortality. Only 13 per cent of patients will survive for five years or more after a diagnosis, the charity says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="6.8"&gt;&lt;div id="e915cb5d-de81-41a2-9e28-49c817eeebd4"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge will be the first in the UK to use the treatment on liver cancer patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Roland Sinker, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: “Histotripsy is an exciting new technology that will make a huge difference to patients. By offering this non-invasive, more targeted treatment, we can care for more people as outpatients and free up time for surgeons to treat more complex cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The installation of the UK’s first histotripsy system at Addenbrooke’s was supported by the Li Ka Shing Foundation, a long-standing backer of cancer research in Cambridge. The technology has been developed by the US company HistoSonics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sinker added: “The faster recovery times mean patients will be able to return to their normal lives more quickly, which will also reduce pressure on hospital beds, helping us ensure that patients are able to receive the right treatment at the right time. We are delighted to be receiving this new state-of-the-art machine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Further studies are under way to explore histotripsy’s use in treating kidney and pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Fiona Carey, who is a kidney cancer patient and co-chair of the patient advisory group for Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, said: “This is seriously good news.

Below, doctors weigh in on the supposed “razor blade” sore throat symptom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people with COVID are reporting a “razor blade throat,” but you don’t need to panic. It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there has been a longstanding recommendation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that people who are at increased risk of getting severe COVID should actually get two COVID vaccinations a year. Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

It’s nothing new.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, as new variants have come on the scene, there almost invariably have been questions about distinctive symptoms, and after a while, when you gather a lot of data, turns out not to be the case — all of these symptoms have occurred before,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, the circulating COVID variants tend to produce the same sort of symptoms and disease as the ones from years ago, Schaffner added. “Although the more recent variants, these omicron variants, are less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very sore throat isn’t specific to the circulating COVID variants, said &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Carrie Horn" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/carrie-a-horn" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Carrie Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the chief medical officer and chief of the division of hospital and internal medicine at National Jewish Health in Colorado. Instead, it’s a symptom that has been associated with COVID infections for a while, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner had not heard of the “razor blade” sore throat symptom particularly, but has heard of people having a severe sore throat with COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people can have a very sore throat that could be described as razor-like, it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to everyone — and it also isn’t some new, scary symptom that is associated with new COVID infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not one outstanding COVID symptom that marks an infection, said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Burns" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/mark-burns/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Mark Burns&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at UofL Health in Louisville, Kentucky. “A sore throat is a symptom of this, but also fever and cough and fatigue, these are all symptoms as well,” Burns added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To sum it all up, the symptoms, including sore throat, are really no different. There’s no increased intensity based on sore throat or anything like that,” added Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from a COVID infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID tends to surge twice a year — once in the winter and once in the mid-to-late summer, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there has been a longstanding recommendation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that people who are at increased risk of getting severe COVID should actually get two COVID vaccinations a year. Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

The cause for the rise in such GI cancers needs more research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e3054" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s likely that there are environmental causes, which include exposures to food, water and micro plastics or lifestyle or dietary changes,” said Cercek, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “You can’t really pin it down to one thing or another. It’s likely multiple factors causing this rise after 1945.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e34ef" class="body-graf"&gt;The appendix is a small pouch that hangs off the large intestine on the lower right side of the abdomen. A blockage can lead to infection and inflammation, called appendicitis, which needs emergency treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eadb19" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike other cancers of the GI tract, appendix cancers aren’t easily found because they’re not as easy to see on abdominal scans and won’t be picked up by colonoscopies, said Dr. Deborah Doroshow, an associate professor of medicine at the Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “So it’s not easy to detect or screen for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1ac1c" class="body-graf"&gt;In fact, Holowatyj said, about 95% of appendix cancers aren’t spotted until after a person has appendicitis and the appendix is removed and examined by pathologists. As a result, the cancers tend to be at a late stage with poorer long-term prognoses, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a0b3c" class="body-graf"&gt;Doroshow, who wasn’t involved with the new study, said it’s important for patients and their doctors to be more aware of subtle symptoms.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published this year pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes and uncovered how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found that many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won. "Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes that were linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.

The ability of these genes to impact cascades and networks of processes, such as gene regulation, could explain why the same variants can contribute to different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pleiotropy was traditionally viewed as a challenge because it complicates the classification of psychiatric disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, if we can understand the genetic basis of pleiotropy, it might allow us to develop treatments targeting these shared genetic factors, which could then help treat multiple psychiatric disorders with a common therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be a very useful strategy given the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates 1 in 8 people (almost 1 billion in total) live with some form of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders"&gt;psychiatric condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.12.022"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in February 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She has a passion for painting and puzzles, an extended social network and an optimistic outlook. She “exemplifies healthy ageing”, Topol says, and he classifies her as one of the “wellderly”. In contrast, most people are the “illderly”; only about a quarter of people aged 65 to 74 in the UK have no diagnosed long-term health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div id="3.0"&gt;&lt;div id="e31bf542-9015-45ca-a887-0522c43e6266"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The cardiologist Eric Topol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;CHARLIE NEUMAN/U-T SAN DIEGO/ZUMA/ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A professor at Scripps Research in San Diego, California, Topol, 70, has published a series of bestsellers on the future of medicine as well as more than 1,300 journal articles. For one research project he looked at 1,400 people who were aged 80-plus, had never been sick and had never had one of the big three chronic illnesses: cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease. He found there was little in their DNA that accounted for their healthy ageing, but they were considerably thinner than their peers, exercised more, were better educated than the general population, and were upbeat and sociable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One thing Topol says can’t be emphasised enough is that cancer and the major age-related diseases of the heart and brain can incubate for 20 years at least before revealing themselves clinically. Those years offer a great opportunity to work on preventing such illnesses. With that in mind, he has written a new book, &lt;i&gt;Super Agers&lt;/i&gt;, in which he lays out how to achieve one’s maximum health span — the number of years lived in optimal health — and shift from the illderly path to the wellderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“You’re going to gain healthy ageing years by adopting these very important lifestyle changes,” Topol says. And the earlier you do so, “the more years of healthy ageing you gain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Adopt an anti-ageing diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol is an advocate of the Mediterranean diet, which is high in vegetables, fruit and fibre. He hasn’t eaten red meat for years. “It’s pro-inflammatory, so if you’re going to have it, don’t make it a frequent thing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He recommends using the app Open Food Facts to scan packets to identify ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which he says he is “religious” about avoiding. One day UPFs will be regarded in a similar way to cigarettes, he believes. “A lot of these are pro-inflammatory and they’ve been linked with all three major age-related diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-slow-ageing-top-tips-ways-slxs665g7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to slow ageing: nine tips from a longevity expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There is little evidence that intermittent fasting improves anti-ageing, and until there is more, his advice is to eat an early dinner and avoid consuming any more calories until breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He drinks a cup or two of coffee in the morning. “I don’t drink it because it’s going to improve healthy ageing, but that’s a bonus.” Observational studies have shown that there is an association between drinking coffee and lower risk of various cancers, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s and type 2 diabetes, although this could be linked to other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;You don’t need to be teetotal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I’ll have a glass or two of wine on weekend nights. That’s about it for me,” Topol says. The data is clear that anything more than moderate drinking (seven drinks a week for men; four to five for women) is not good for us. However, social engagement is important for healthy ageing and that often involves a drink. Topol’s best summary of the studies of light alcohol intake (a couple of drinks a week) is that it is not a problem, but the risk quickly increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Ditch the supplements &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His patients often provide long lists of the supplements they’re taking. “I just shake my head. They’re wasting a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.16"&gt;&lt;div id="5c805ec1-bc59-49fb-9c68-b100e81032a5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Richard Morgan, 93, on the rowing machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ROW2K.COM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;It’s never too late to start exercising&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol cites the case of Richard Morgan, a 93-year-old Irishman who had never exercised regularly before he reached his seventies, when he started using a rowing machine in his shed and then went on to win indoor rowing competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Even walking briskly for just over an hour a day is associated with living for four and a half years longer than those who don’t exercise. Though it is important, if walking is your main exercise, that your heart rate is increased for a sustained period of 30 minutes or longer and you are not simply counting steps accrued during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/anti-ageing-vaccine-is-closer-than-ever-but-what-helps-now-mvxfmh9q3" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anti-ageing vaccine is ‘closer than ever’ — but what helps now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For years Topol emphasised to his patients the importance of aerobic exercise, but he has become convinced that preserving core strength is also vital. “In the past year-plus I’ve been very diligent about incorporating balance and strength training,” he says. Topol strength trains four times a week using resistance bands and exercises such as planks and lunges, as well as balance training and completing a similar number of sessions of aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling and swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He also tries to get outside regularly; a UK Biobank study found that long-term exposure to greenery where we live was associated with reduced anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Deep sleep matters &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About seven hours of sleep is the optimal amount. Surprisingly, sleeping beyond seven hours may be associated with signs of cognitive and mental health decline, Topol says. There also appears to be a relationship between sleeping for more than eight hours and heightened all-cause morbidity — though Topol stresses that this is at a population level, and that some people perform better with eight or six hours’ sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Among the benefits of deep sleep, or non-rapid eye movement sleep, is that it helps to clear the brain of metabolic waste that may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Using a sleep tracker, Topol discovered that he was getting as little as 15 minutes a night of deep sleep. Some experts suggest we need one to two hours, but it depends on our age, Topol says. He increased his deep sleep to an hour a night by adopting a stricter bedtime routine, stopping exercising and eating late in the evenings, and hydrating earlier in the day so he didn’t wake to urinate. He is sceptical of sleep medications, some of which could make toxins in the brain more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;The tests that could help you li&lt;b&gt;ve longer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genome sequencing is underused, according to Topol, who says it is vital for identifying disease-causing genetic mutations in those with unknown illnesses (last week &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/david-cameron-dna-test-sick-children-build-register-mx5g5zf87" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;David Cameron called for all infants admitted to paediatric care to be tested for unusual genetic conditions&lt;/a&gt;). In some cases, a test to reveal disease-causing genes — particularly those associated with cancer — may cost only a few hundred pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/why-sitting-unhealthy-standing-how-to-stay-fit-zq8brhr5c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why sitting for more than 60 hours a week is ageing you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Polygenic-risk tests for specific diseases are also available for common cancers, heart disease and Alzheimer’s. They can be sought at private clinics and online and test a sample of saliva or blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Organ clocks, which measure proteins in the blood, can reveal which individual organs are ageing faster than the rest of the body. Studies have been carried out with UK Biobank participants, and Topol expects commercial tests will be available in the near future — and will eventually form a routine part of health assessments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;But don’t say yes to every test &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol is scornful of companies offering full MRI scans. “That’s completely off the rails,” he says. “The chance for harm is greater than the potential benefit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scans can also lead to unnecessary interventions. He has seen patients almost bleed to death from a liver biopsy or who suffered a collapsed lung “from a biopsy of an innocent nodule”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is dismissive of Bryan Johnson, the Silicon Valley biohacker who is spending $2 million a year trying to reverse the ageing process, and of private clinics offering blood transfusions from young people at $8,000 a litre. “Ridiculous! We have longevity clinics that charge $250,000 a year. It’s reckless and predatory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Microbiome tests are popular, but Topol cautions that there isn’t a reliable commercial test yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Beware of anti-ageing drugs &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He worries that not enough is being done to tackle serious threats to our lifespans, including environmental pollution, microplastics and “forever chemicals”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The jury is still out on some scientific advances, including much-hyped anti-ageing drugs. “Some are very effective in mice and rats, but rodents are not people,” he says. “There’s some very strong science that’s being pursued but there’s no guarantee we’re going to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, he is excited about where science is taking us. A company called Infinity Bio has developed a blood test that can determine a person’s exposure to more than 500 viruses. This may become commercially available in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Ozempic could prevent diseases in old age &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol’s greatest enthusiasm is reserved for GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, which he says may play a role in “the next frontier for medicine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“These gut hormones that talk to the brain and talk to the immune system are going to be one of the most important groups of medicine going forward to help prevent the big three diseases — cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative — and we have trials for Alzheimer’s ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is not overly concerned about the side-effects. “Gastrointestinal side-effects usually dissipate in the first few weeks. The side-effect of muscle mass loss in people who are obese can be countered by resistance training.” But he does have one reservation: he is not a fan of people having to take drugs for the rest of their lives. “It would be nice if we had a weaning strategy, and the companies don’t appear to have any interest in that.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super Agers by Eric Topol (Simon &amp;amp; Schuster £22).

Rates among older millennials, born in the 1980s, were more than four times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even with those increases, appendix cancer still remains extremely rare. Doctors diagnose an &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979656/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 3,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States each year, compared with more than 150,000 cases of colon and rectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings come at a time of growing concern about the earlier onset of certain cancers, including colorectal, breast and kidney cancers. The new research describes what’s known as a “birth cohort” effect, or a disease becoming more common among successive generations. Such an effect lends credence to the idea that people born after a certain time have had similar exposures to something that is increasing their cancer risk more so than among people born decades before, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And the fact that researchers have seen similar generational effects in colorectal and gastric cancers suggests there may be some shared risk factors between those cancers and appendix cancer, said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who researches the epidemiology of colon cancer and also was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Diet is one such possibility, he said.

Summers in Southwest cities have set records in recent years for prolonged heat waves that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/19/seniors-heat-wave-phoenix-arizona/"&gt;can be life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; for people who cannot find &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/25/excessive-heat-renters-ac-cooling/"&gt;places to cool down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MPDZAKFWHNHOZDJ5ITFJDWG56E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were about 600 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year, about half of which were of people experiencing homelessness, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5934"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the county’s Health Department. Temperatures in Phoenix last year surpassed 110 degrees Fahrenheit on 70 days, a record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KOKKEN42CJB75BJOAPIQZUMQ6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weckstein and her colleagues analyzed emergency department data from 2021 and 2022 during the months of May to September across the country, when nearly 60,000 Americans were treated for heat-related illness. The rate of homeless people visiting emergency rooms was 604 per 100,000 people; for non-homeless people, the rate was 22 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJMOJXEVDZHVXEQY4GK4UURTQY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The homeless people who did visit emergency rooms were also twice as likely to be hospitalized as non-homeless people, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TQP3Q6Q6ZJFPPJCT2H3L54J2D4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study broke down the country by region but did not provide more granular geographic data.

A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38844692/" target="_blank"&gt;study last year&lt;/a&gt; looked at how temperature impacted mortality among the homeless in counties surrounding Los Angeles and Las Vegas between 2015 and 2022. It found that nearly half the deaths of homeless people in the Las Vegas area in that period were attributable to heat, and about 5 percent in the Los Angeles area were — “orders of magnitude greater” than in the general population, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YKLI7XUYRZH7XHJZ5JS5M6FOEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weckstein, who will soon start her residency in internal medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, said she wants to be a practitioner working mostly with homeless individuals. She noted the need for more affordable housing and better access to shelters and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/15/cooling-centers-limitations-heatwaves-cities/"&gt;cooling centers&lt;/a&gt;. Her research “points to the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable groups,” she said, “and the need for policies that protect those at greatest risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 20:16:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQdG9Fb3BESEdZTFJneUlIU21yZ2ZSTFR5WUxENTFpRU5Ka0ROWEhUOWpXMzk0WVFaRTluV2cxcFcxRWUyczBrMjFYVTBMVEljWnM5NWdqNmRWZTQ1d0ZRdHlhQnFMdzBLWDV0dnk1U1JXVm42WndGcjVQOTZuY1Q0NS14SnFEV294VHR4bzF1YTBfaXNrNVFXeXJ3</guid></item><item><title>流行的糖替代品赤藓糖醇可能会损害脑血管健康，研究发现- PsyPost | Popular sugar substitute erythritol may impair brain blood vessel health, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOMHRER0VSaFFWSFhYcGVDcDdPZ0g0NzA3bUxPU2FoUnhqTmpOMFN6QnZzYURyOHNJcTlGMjVBNTBlb3d6X1Y2YU1HQ0ZsckIxb3cwS012SWpzQ0lUd1FUaVpLV29GY0dNcDZrclBhTngxQkE2OU5oS3VoUHk4VzA2Y2Z3SkVSYndpSFlVWXNHZ3F1a0hYZEhTOENsMWQzVlhmSUpaVUU4aGFWcFNXOGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that erythritol, a popular sugar substitute, may negatively affect the cells lining blood vessels in the brain. In laboratory experiments, researchers found that erythritol increased oxidative stress, disrupted nitric oxide production, promoted the release of a blood vessel-constricting compound, and impaired the release of a key clot-busting protein. These changes are all associated with a higher risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is widely used as a low-calorie sweetener. It is found in many “sugar-free” or “keto” products, including soft drinks, baked goods, and candies. Because it has minimal impact on blood sugar and insulin, erythritol has been promoted as a healthier alternative to sugar for people with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. It is naturally present in small amounts in fruits and vegetables and can also be produced in the body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved erythritol for use as a food additive in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concerns about erythritol’s effects on cardiovascular health have been rising. A 2023 study by Witkowski and colleagues reported that higher levels of erythritol in the blood were linked to a greater risk of heart attack and stroke over a three-year period. This association held true across sexes and across populations in the United States and Europe. The same research group also found that drinking a beverage containing erythritol led to increased platelet reactivity—a potential contributor to blood clots. Other studies have similarly noted a possible link between erythritol and heart-related health risks. However, until now, there has been limited direct evidence on how erythritol affects blood vessel function at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers in the new study examined how erythritol influences brain microvascular endothelial cells, which line the small blood vessels in the brain and help regulate blood flow. These cells also play a role in controlling inflammation, preventing clot formation, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier. When they become dysfunctional, the risk of stroke and other brain disorders can increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an in vitro model, meaning they grew human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells in the lab and exposed them to erythritol. The dose they used—6 millimolar—was equivalent to the amount of erythritol found in a typical artificially sweetened beverage, or about 30 grams. The cells were exposed to erythritol for three hours, after which various markers of cell function were measured. These included oxidative stress levels, nitric oxide and endothelin-1 production, and the ability of cells to release tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), a protein that helps dissolve blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed several concerning changes. First, the erythritol-treated cells produced significantly more reactive oxygen species—compounds that can damage cells and are a key sign of oxidative stress. Specifically, cells exposed to erythritol showed about a 75% increase in reactive oxygen species compared to untreated cells. This rise in oxidative stress was accompanied by an increase in antioxidant proteins like superoxide dismutase-1 and catalase, suggesting that the cells were attempting to counteract the harmful effects of the stress but were not able to fully do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide is a molecule produced by blood vessel cells that helps keep blood vessels open and maintains healthy blood flow. While the overall level of the enzyme responsible for nitric oxide production—endothelial nitric oxide synthase—did not change, the activation of this enzyme was significantly reduced in erythritol-treated cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, one form of activation, called phosphorylation at Ser1177, dropped by about 65%, while an inhibitory modification, phosphorylation at Thr495, increased by roughly 85%. As a result, nitric oxide production dropped by about 20%. Reduced nitric oxide availability is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction and is linked to increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the study found an increase in the production of endothelin-1, a peptide that causes blood vessels to constrict. Levels of its precursor, Big ET-1, were significantly higher in erythritol-treated cells, and the amount of endothelin-1 released into the surrounding environment was about 30% higher. Elevated endothelin-1 can lead to excessive narrowing of blood vessels and impair cerebral blood flow, especially during times of increased demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final part of the study looked at the cells’ ability to release t-PA, a protein that helps dissolve blood clots and is essential for preventing stroke. While baseline t-PA levels were similar between treated and untreated cells, the erythritol-treated cells failed to increase their t-PA output in response to thrombin, a compound that normally triggers clot-busting activity. In contrast, untreated cells showed a robust increase in t-PA release. This suggests that erythritol impairs the cells’ ability to respond to clot-promoting conditions, potentially weakening the body’s natural ability to prevent strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the findings point to a concerning pattern. Erythritol exposure increased oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide availability, increased production of a vessel-constricting compound, and blunted the release of a key clot-dissolving enzyme. All of these changes are well-established features of cerebrovascular dysfunction and are known contributors to the development and severity of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While erythritol is widely used in sugar-free products marketed as healthier alternatives, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on vascular health,” said Auburn Berry, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and first author of the study, in a news release. “In general, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers caution that the study was conducted in vitro and cannot directly predict how erythritol will affect brain blood vessels in a living person. The experimental model used isolated human endothelial cells and tested only a single, acute exposure. Real-world effects might depend on the dose, frequency, and duration of erythritol consumption, as well as individual health factors. Still, the study’s findings align with recent clinical and epidemiological research linking erythritol consumption to increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine whether repeated or long-term exposure to erythritol produces similar effects in living organisms, including humans. Future studies should also explore whether other non-nutritive sweeteners have similar impacts on endothelial health, and whether certain populations may be more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;The Non-Nutritive Sweetner Erythritol Adversely Affects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell Function&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Auburn R.

It’s not uncommon as people age, affecting 15 to 30 percent of older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VGJKXPHEYFFZTGLPH2U7GJ35TM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Feeling less hungry occasionally may not be anything to worry about, but if it persists, it can lead to negative health consequences in older adults, says Mary Hickson, a professor of dietetics at the University of Plymouth in England. Here’s how to know when a lack of appetite may be harmful and how to help bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3BOEHFR7XNHODDFOHQRLSIGSBU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3BOEHFR7XNHODDFOHQRLSIGSBU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why you feel less hungry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A4ALIDFWL5BA5KVSQA3A5LC2IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How appetite works isn’t well understood, but scientists know that the brain and the digestive, endocrine and nervous systems all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FSNEKKMZ5AMXN7N2EBVD2TBDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, metabolism slows with age, and that can make food less interesting. Your sense of taste or smell may diminish, and that can affect your appetite, too. Hormonal shifts may dampen the desire to eat and make you feel fuller when you do. Also, “life events,” Hickson says, such as retirement, loss of a job or the loss of a partner who did the cooking, “can trigger changes in what people eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XNJADEDNSZGALEANSCTPHDOSEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, the problem may not be related to the desire to eat but to difficulty eating. For example, saliva production can decrease because of age or a medication you’re taking (such as common ones for high blood pressure, an overactive bladder and depression). This can make food taste drier and harder to swallow. Tooth decay, poorly fitting dental work and jaw problems can lead to trouble chewing. And having little appetite may be a sign of some illnesses, such as an underactive thyroid or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RLSBCAXKENDTFGSBNY5KL7QAME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A prolonged lack of appetite and unintentional weight loss aren’t a normal part of aging, says Leah Cahill, an associate professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. See your doctor if the following signs last longer than a week: You’re skipping more meals, passing up formerly favorite foods, eating only a few bites at a meal or feeling nauseous at the thought of food. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dieting-weight-loss/how-to-lose-weight-safely-a7419492212/" target="_blank"&gt;Losing weight&lt;/a&gt; without trying over a six-month span should also trigger a health-care visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LRCRTE43HJAIBATVAKDS3ECM6Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LRCRTE43HJAIBATVAKDS3ECM6Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What happens when you don’t eat enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAR2LAOJUNAGFBA5WYWX4MCBVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Taking in fewer calories can cause weight and muscle loss, which can zap energy and affect balance and strength. It also makes it hard to get the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients you need. “The body requires nutrients for its basic functions, and not getting enough food can cause your body systems to weaken and not work as they should,” Cahill says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKUXXV5D2NBU7ODOZLXWULFDEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frailty is another consequence, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jfa.2022.14" target="_blank"&gt;2022 international task force report&lt;/a&gt; on appetite loss and aging. Frailty, characterized by weight loss, weakness, being less physically active, exhaustion and cognitive decline, can make you more vulnerable to illness and falls, and to having worse outcomes when those occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="B2JTD6U2KFFFJCSPAD63E4OPUA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="B2JTD6U2KFFFJCSPAD63E4OPUA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Tips to boost appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MVY6BVHZF5E4FPAEGD7YX3SJSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In general, diet and lifestyle changes are preferred over prescription appetite stimulants because the latter don’t help much and have side effects. Forcing food on yourself isn’t a good move, either, because it can make you queasy, Hickson says. Instead, try the following strategies to help you improve your appetite and stay healthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ID6TAORWYJCUTA6KYVRLA2HVGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switch to mini-meals.&lt;/b&gt; Can’t manage a full meal? “Start with a smaller portion size of everything you would normally eat or have a goal of eating half of everything on your plate,” says Jen Bruning, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Or try having three smaller meals plus three snacks, Hickson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDV6EO6L7VFJVBYK6NENLXDJRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize protein.&lt;/b&gt; It’s important for building and preserving muscle. It also helps fight infection and maintain skin elasticity, so “get some protein on the plate with every meal,” Bruning says. And to make sure you get it in, eat it first in case you get too full before you finish your meal. Eggs, cottage cheese, yogurt, fish, tofu, chicken and other lean meats, legumes and nut butters (almond, peanut, cashew) are all good sources. If you have trouble getting enough protein from food alone, having a protein drink (such as Ensure) or adding a scoop of protein powder to smoothies might be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I4MA35GXTFHV5MGMJMJNCKQXR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pair fruits and veggies with a dip.&lt;/b&gt; Any kind of produce makes a nutrient-rich snack. But fruits and vegetables are low in calories and quite filling. To get more of the vitamins, minerals and calories you need, serve them with nutritious higher-calorie dips, such as nut butters, full-fat yogurt, hummus or guacamole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJQATR3DDJCMLFKLJMDNO7U5BI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drink water between — not with — meals.&lt;/b&gt; You need to stay hydrated, but water can take up room in your stomach. As a result, you may leave too much food on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GBDBX2KYNJF23J3POM5W5X3NFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indulge in full-fat foods&lt;/b&gt;. Fat is the most concentrated source of calories, and older adults — especially those over 75 — can afford to carry a bit more weight, Hickson says. So it’s okay to have full-fat milk, cheese and yogurt, and butter on your toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PLCSRIC2XFECVDWDKYHOFCECJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use herbs and spices liberally.&lt;/b&gt; They add flavor to food, and the aroma as they cook can be an appetite stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L2W32FLWPFFNBLJPAAYI2HFMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat with others when you can.&lt;/b&gt; Research shows that you might eat less if you eat alone and that having company might increase your intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BSXJH3FN4NHH5BS25ATLSDETAA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BSXJH3FN4NHH5BS25ATLSDETAA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Little meals that pack a big nutrition punch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSNRRA5IMRBGZP6QMTLIAOBG4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, moderately active men over age 50 require 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day to get the fuel and nutrients they need, while women of a similar age and activity level need 1,800 calories. If you’re not feeling very hungry, it can be tough to eat that much food. One solution is to have smaller portions spread out throughout the day and to ensure the food you eat is full of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O4UPBULSNFAWXK2V7MVREEVM7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s an example of what a healthy daily menu containing about 2,000 calories might look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7RWJKTDTAZADDOGEHJNC2KJA5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breakfast.&lt;/b&gt; Soft Taco Scramble: Scramble 1 egg and 2 egg whites with Monterey Jack cheese and ½ cup of fresh baby spinach.

              &lt;p&gt;Your zip code may shape your aging brain’s health. New research out today shows that people’s odds of being diagnosed with dementia differ significantly across different parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, led the study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2834952"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Neurology. They analyzed the medical records of veterans, finding that dementia rates were noticeably higher in the Southeast, Northwest, and other regions, even after accounting for some possible factors like income. The findings suggest that deep-seated regional differences can contribute to dementia risk, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is a growing public health issue, particularly among the elderly. More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia currently and a government-funded study this February &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states"&gt;projected&lt;/a&gt; that 42% of Americans over 55 will develop it in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a complex condition, with most cases caused by a mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. But according to senior study author and neurologist Kristine Yaffe, there’s been little research looking at how the risk of dementia can vary geographically, at least on a national level. Yaffe and her team had access to a dataset that had the potential to shed light on that: deidentified records from people enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We realized the VA national data would allow for such an investigation as the VA has a uniform way of capturing data across the U.S.,” Yaffe, who is also chief of neuropsychiatry at the San Francisco VA healthcare system, told Gizmodo in an email. “There are no other national healthcare systems that have this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yaffe’s team studied the health of more than 1.2 million randomly selected VA patients 65 years and older who had no pre-existing dementia. These people were followed for an average length of 12 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, dementia rates were lowest in the Mid-Atlantic region, covering states like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Using this as a baseline, the researchers found that dementia rates were 25% higher in the Southeast (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama); 23% higher in both the Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) and the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas); 18% higher in the South (Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana); 13% higher in the Southwest (California, Nevada, and Arizona); and 7% in the Northeast (New York).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is a very large difference, especially given that these are all veterans with care at the VAHS,” Yaffe said. “It was really surprising we saw such big differences.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers reasoned that factors such as a person’s average level of education, how rural a state was, or the rate of other health conditions like heart disease within these states might explain most of the variance they found. But even when they adjusted for these variables, the patterns barely budged at all. That could mean there are other reasons—reasons not so easily captured through medical records alone—why someone in New Jersey will tend to have a lower risk of dementia than a similar person in Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the differences are explained by lifelong differences in things like education quality (vs quantity) and social determinants of health might be driving some of the differences,” Yaffe said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings now leave open more questions to be answered, which the team plans to start digging into. With any luck, the lessons they learn might help us find new ways to better prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

Merck said in a release that it expects orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the virus starts to spread widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year. Complications from RSV are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to ensuring availability of [Enflonsia] in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems," Dr. Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's shot will compete against a similar blockbuster treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca called Beyfortus, which was in short supply nationwide during the 2023 RSV season due to unprecedented demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are preventative monoclonal antibodies, which deliver antibodies directly into the bloodstream to provide immediate protection. But each targets a different part of the virus, making it difficult to compare them directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's shot can be administered to infants regardless of their weight, which the company said may offer convenience in terms of dosing. Meanwhile, the recommended dosage of Beyfortus is based on an infant's body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanofi on Monday &lt;a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2025/2025-06-09-05-00-00-3095598" target="_blank"&gt;revealed &lt;/a&gt;an aggressive effort to increase supply of Beyfortus, including a plan to begin shipping the shot early in the third quarter. Last year, Beyfortus booked sales of €1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines for RSV are also available in the U.S. from companies such as &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/GSK/"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But those shots are only for use in adults or in pregnant women.

The shot also reduced lower respiratory infections that required medical attention by more than 60% compared with a placebo through five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 19:30:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPRVhrOUVhUVZwNFJsTFJ3THM1VldHNUI2cW1SejVjS19udi1mYklQVVZhS1hCZzZnX3FqNThOWG53Q0lPN3ZwUW5wMEVGdDRNczNUWExvQm1sdzgxWUU4bzM2OTBuOGlFWml4R00xd29yZmFVTG05Z1A5djR6SjJ2Y0UycWRLUWdfMkVnNS1kYllweG45aW1TLVl2UFBMSVZHUGs0WXhqQdIBrAFBVV95cUxOQUM1eXNNZTBuNi1pTkctXzBUUzItb3hRekFCNVZQODZ5Ql9RRjRLT2VUZ2JDR1lWcUNNRTNyYjBKdko0WkE5OUI1UlRDeUVPbXZNblg5cUhWMWxPbDBCTGdJUkdSTzBPa1hOUE9TczNyc1Bfcmo0U1YzOG1nUjdFT0lwUUNMN216X1l0bjlHeHdIU3Nhc3l2ck5UOWd2YkZvNnZmQzRqR2psbllf</guid></item><item><title>什么是TRT ？专家讨论男性“绝经期”以及如何安全地治疗低睾酮-《纽约邮报》 | What is TRT?

&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it. RJK Jr. has explored a few controversial ideas, particularly in the health and wellness sector. But, regardless of where you stand on his views, one thing is hard to deny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking back at those viral videos of him &lt;a href="https://www.insideedition.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-is-not-on-steroids-credits-testosterone-replacement-and-fitness-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pumping weights&lt;/a&gt; at Gold’s Gym back in 2023, he was in phenomenal shape for a man his age — biceps bulging, chest chiseled, pecks defined. He could have been an amateur bodybuilder. For a nearly 70-year-old, he was &lt;em&gt;ripped&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the videos surfaced, rumors began buzzing that Kennedy was on steroids. He promptly denied it, instead crediting his disciplined 35-minute workout routine. There was one other thing he mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I take testosterone replacement, which are appropriate to my age, and then I take a big fistful of nutrients,” he explained in an &lt;a href="https://www.insideedition.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-is-not-on-steroids-credits-testosterone-replacement-and-fitness-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Newsmax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes associated with menopause are not so secret. Women are warned about hot flashes, mood swings, and decreased periods — all of which have been studied and scrutinized for as long as most of us can remember. But &lt;em&gt;Man-opause&lt;/em&gt;? Until recently, it has remained a blind spot in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age-related decline in testosterone levels, sometimes called Andropause — or “Manopause” colloquially — has often been met with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Emerging research has begun to spark conversations around male aging and hormonal health. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17062768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology revealed that testosterone levels in American men have dropped about 1% per year since the 1980s. The decline can not be attributed to aging alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






	&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some endocrinologists have studied the root causes, suspecting the decline is due to the increase in ultra-processed foods, pesticides, as well as drug use, and other environmental concerns. Others are focused on the best ways to raise levels back to the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people like Deep Patel, co-founder of the telehealth company &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D3001441%26m%3D162919%26afftrack%3Dnyp-FF-TXL-whatistrt%26urllink%3Dulo.co%2Fproducts%2Ftestosterone-replacement-therapy&amp;amp;author=Miska%20Salemann&amp;amp;articleID=35941372&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=june%209%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=testosterone&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ulo&lt;/a&gt;, the statistic was a catalyst for exploring Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) as a potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like the male version of menopause, except no one acknowledged it until recently,” Patel told the New York Post. “And look, the data backs this up. Endocrinologists have documented a population-wide decrease in testosterone levels over the past few decades. It’s not just in people’s heads.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone levels typically begin to decline when men reach their forties, at which point, some will start to experience a range of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, everything from hair loss and lowered libido to decreased muscle mass and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes are to be expected, but others can reveal a larger condition, hypogonadism. Men with particularly low levels of testosterone — “Low T,” as the guys say — could also suffer from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, osteoporosis, and even infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To determine whether levels are healthy or low, men can take a TRT test. These blood tests, typically administered in the morning when levels peak, examine the amount of the male hormone present in the blood. The &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;normal range&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be anywhere between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For men outside the normal range, some Doctors recommend trying TRT, the routine that RFK Jr. and millions of others have embraced as part of their anti-aging and health protocols. On TikTok, the tag “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/trt-before-and-after?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TRT Before and After&lt;/a&gt;” has amassed thousands of videos and millions of views showcasing brawny men flexing their quads and joking about their sudden burst of energy and newfound sex drives. Unlike Kennedy, many of these men are still young, in their twenties and thirties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT has become more accessible through providers and online TRT companies like Ulo, but it’s essential to recognize that it’s only &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; for specific conditions, such as hypogonadism or diminished functional activity of the gonads. TRT is not FDA-approved for men with low levels due to aging or other non-medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical experts still have varying opinions on treatment. Some believe that the “normal range” does not sufficiently identify men who could benefit from TRT. Others take a more conservative approach, warning that the potential side effects outweigh the benefits and that TRT should be reserved for men with particularly low levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To break down the myths surrounding manopause and TRT, The Post spoke with three experts who have years of experience in the men’s health field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is testosterone declining in America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone levels have declined substantially over the last couple of decades, and experts believe several factors may be contributing to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, testosterone is declining in American men of all age groups, young and old. No one is talking about that,” shared Dr. Michael Aziz, the author of “&lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="0757325149" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAgeless-Revolution-Hallmarks-Defeating-Reversing%2Fdp%2F0757325149%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Ageless Revolution&lt;/a&gt;” and an anti-aging internist and regenerative physician specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azis believes that the decline in level is tied to several environmental problems, dietary changes, and how men socialize. “This has to do with increased consumption of ultra-processed food, use of pesticides, excess alcohol, legalization of recreational drugs, smoking, and trans fats,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the ideal testosterone levels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most medical centers and experts considered normal testosterone levels to land anywhere between 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, age is also an important factor. Azis explained that it is important to look at each patient individually in order to determine whether their levels are considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If testosterone levels are checked, the lab reference is wrong, as it groups all men. Lab levels are 300-1000 nanograms per deciliter, so men in their twenties who are supposed to have a testosterone of 1,000 are placed in the same category as 80-year-old men with levels of 300,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, Azis explained that some young people with low levels are told that their results are normal when, in reality, they could be ideal candidates for TRT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many men suffer as doctors treat those men with drugs for depression or ED pills, versus looking at testosterone levels,” Azis warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is TRT, and how is TRT used to treat low testosterone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mostafa Abu-Hijlih, a nurse practitioner practicing at Grand Central Men’s Health in NYC, says that TRT has been a game-changer for his patients. He always felt there was a gap in clinical spaces for men to discuss issues that have been historically stigmatized, but TRT opened up the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone Replacement Therapy is a medical treatment used to optimize testosterone levels in men and women when indicated, ” Abu-Hijlih explained. “Testosterone is responsible for energy levels, libido, muscle mass, and bone density, and has been shown to improve REM sleep time when optimized.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT works by replenishing the lost testosterone that the body is not producing naturally. It’s not about taking extra testosterone but rather restoring the body to a healthy, normal level. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abu-Hijlih pointed out that the dosage depends on what is needed for each patient, and testosterone levels should be continuously monitored to determine the appropriate dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is TRT administered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Abu-Hijlih, there are a few different options for TRT patients when it comes to how testosterone is administered and absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;blackday – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT is administered through a variety of modalities, including weekly intramuscular injections, topical cream, implantable pellets, or even intranasal nose spray,” he noted. “Really depends on a combination of clinical results, patient preference, and tolerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for patients to try different administration techniques until they find the one that works best for them. About 90% of Abu-Hijlih’s patients undergo TRT via a weekly intramuscular injection into their arm or their glutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of TRT&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of TRT include increased energy, improved sleep quality, higher libido, enhanced intimate performance, and better results at the gym. Abu-Hijlih described how many patients begin to feel young again, with more motivation to participate in all the activities they used to love, but no longer had the energy for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The improvement in overall quality of life is always incredibly gratifying to witness,” he shared. “They walk in standing taller, [with] higher levels of confidence, regained energy levels to work out at the gym again, and have a bounce in their step that makes it a very gratifying experience for both the patients and the provider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has also revealed that TRT is an effective option for addressing psychological and sexual symptoms associated with hypogonadism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6765788/#:~:text=Men%20most%20frequently%20claimed%20testosterone,emphasis%20on%20sex%20and%20energy." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; on prescription testosterone found that 52% of men claimed testosterone improved their energy, 42% saw improvements in their libido, and 29% reported muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can benefit from TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Patel is not a physician, but he has built his career around solving real-world problems that men deal with every day. His telehealth company, &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D3001441%26m%3D162919%26afftrack%3Dnyp-FF-TXL-whatistrt%26urllink%3Dulo.co%2Fproducts%2Ftestosterone-replacement-therapy&amp;amp;author=Miska%20Salemann&amp;amp;articleID=35941372&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=june%209%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=testosterone&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ulo&lt;/a&gt;, has been working to make TRT more accessible to men than ever before, and he says that their services are not bound to men over 50.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger men can benefit from TRT, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More and more men in their twenties, thirties, and forties are dealing with low T,” Patel shared. “About 40% of men over 45 have clinically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;low testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re seeing younger guys affected too. If that sounds like you, it’s worth getting your levels checked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get TRT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many providers and telehealth sites offer TRT services. In many cases, the first step is taking a TRT test and speaking with a doctor about symptoms. Companies like Ulo treat patients holistically, considering their specific needs and tailoring the treatment to their individual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest mistake people make is doing TRT without medical guidance or buying unregulated testosterone products online,” Patel said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At Ulo, we monitor every guy’s complete bloodwork regularly, not just testosterone, but also things like hematocrit, estradiol, and lipid profiles — and adjust treatment accordingly to catch issues before they become problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel explained that the best way to minimize risk is to work with a legitimate provider who actually looks at your bloodwork and adjusts your protocol based on how your body specifically responds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to see results from TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel explained that symptom relief can look different in everyone, but you shouldn’t have to wait long to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As for results, most guys feel a difference within four to six weeks,” he noted. “More energy, better mood, stronger libido. The body composition changes, like more muscle and less fat, usually take a bit longer, around two to three months.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel cited one TRT patient who knew the treatment was working when he woke up one morning and actually wanted to go to the gym for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is TRT safe? What are TRT risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When properly monitored, research indicates that TRT can be safe long-term for most men. That said, every patient needs regular blood work to ensure their levels stay within a healthy range, according to Patel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TRT does come with risks that need to be taken seriously. The most common side effects include acne, water retention, or elevated red blood cell counts, which can thicken your blood,” he shared. “Some men experience testicular shrinkage or reduced fertility. There are also concerns about cardiovascular risks in certain populations, particularly men with existing heart conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can TRT affect fertility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, TRT can affect fertility, especially if you’re not using anything to counteract it. TRT significantly suppresses natural testosterone production, which can also reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6305868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sperm production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But if fertility matters to you, there are medications like HCG or enclomiphene that can be taken&lt;br&gt;alongside TRT to preserve it,” Patel pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10890669/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, over 90% of men maintained normal sperm counts when using these fertility-preserving medications with TRT. Patel stressed the importance of telling providers that fertility is a priority before they begin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does TRT cost? Does insurance cover TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of TRT varies depending on factors such as your insurance coverage, provider, treatment needs, and the location of the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some insurance providers do cover TRT, but patients must meet specific thresholds. Most providers require TRT candidates to have medical documentation that indicates their testosterone has fallen below the normal levels, as well as recorded symptoms like fatigue or low libido.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re paying out of pocket, the cost of TRT will depend on the type of treatment. Most testosterone injections cost between $50 and $150, oral tablets around $300, and patches can reach $400. Some telehealth companies offer a range of treatments for a monthly subscription cost, which can range from $100 to $300 per month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you try TRT? Is it worth it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Patel has seen many men suffer from low testosterone firsthand. It’s not uncommon for him to hear them say things like “I can’t focus like I used to,” “I feel flat mentally, physically, sexually,” “I’ve lost my drive,” or “I just don’t feel like me anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after optimizing for sleep, diet, and everything else, their low testosterone was still impacting their everyday lives. Once they received treatment, things began to shift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re not looking for shortcuts. They’re looking to feel normal again,” Patel said. “And, often they’ve tried everything else — better sleep, different diets, supplements, lifestyle changes. TRT is rarely the first thing they try, but for many with genuinely low levels, it’s the solution that finally works.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT could be right for you, but, as with any new health treatment, it’s important to consult your physician and explain your symptoms prior to making any changes to your regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;ENFLONSIA is a preventive monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants against a spectrum of RSV disease severity, including worsening disease requiring hospitalization&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="bwalignc"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ENFLONSIA is the first and only RSV preventive option administered to infants using the same dose regardless of weight&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bw-dateline-wrapper"&gt;RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- &lt;/span&gt;
Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ENFLONSIA™ (clesrovimab-cfor) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in neonates (newborns) and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is a preventive, long-acting monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season, with the same 105 mg dose regardless of weight. A typical RSV season usually spans autumn to spring of the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“RSV disease is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S. and can lead to serious respiratory conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia,” said Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and investigator for the CLEVER (MK-1654-004) and SMART (MK-1654-007) trials. “ENFLONSIA combines dosing convenience with strong clinical data showing significant reductions in RSV disease incidence and hospitalizations, making it a promising new intervention to help protect infants from RSV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENFLONSIA should not be administered to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA. See additional Selected Safety Information below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 2b/3 CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) evaluating a single dose of ENFLONSIA administered to preterm and full-term infants (birth to 1 year of age). The trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints, as outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="bwlistdisc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENFLONSIA demonstrated a reduction in incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections (MALRI) requiring ≥1 indicator of lower respiratory infection (LRI) or severity compared to placebo through 5 months (primary endpoint) by 60.5% (95% CI: 44.2, 72.0, p&amp;lt;0.001) (incidence rates: ENFLONSIA, 0.026; placebo, 0.065).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENFLONSIA demonstrated a reduction in RSV-associated hospitalizations through 5 months (key secondary endpoint) by 84.3% (95% CI: 66.7, 92.6, p&amp;lt;0.001) (incidence rates: ENFLONSIA, 0.004; placebo, 0.024), showing increasing efficacy with increasing disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval is also supported by results from the Phase 3 SMART trial (MK-1654-007) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA versus palivizumab in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ENFLONSIA provides an important new preventive option to help protect healthy and at-risk infants born during or entering their first RSV season with the same dose regardless of weight,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are committed to ensuring availability of ENFLONSIA in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet later this month to discuss and make recommendations for the use of ENFLONSIA in infants. Ordering is anticipated to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the start of the 2025-2026 RSV season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About ENFLONSIA™ (clesrovimab-cfor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENFLONSIA (clesrovimab-cfor) is Merck’s extended half-life monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for passive immunization for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is administered using non-weight-based dosing and is designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season. For infants born during the RSV season, ENFLONSIA is to be administered starting from birth. For infants born outside of the RSV season, ENFLONSIA should be administered prior to the start of their first RSV season. For infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass during or entering their first RSV season, an additional 105 mg dose is recommended as soon as the infant is stable after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selected Safety Information for ENFLONSIA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(clesrovimab-cfor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not administer ENFLONSIA to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with other human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema (3.8%), injection-site swelling (2.7%) and rash (2.3%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Clinical Trials and Data Supporting U.S. FDA Approval&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) (&lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclassic.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04767373&amp;amp;esheet=54271340&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250609303937&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=NCT04767373&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=bce1f4aa575013b9fa9bac315951e307" rel="nofollow"&gt;NCT04767373&lt;/a&gt;) was a Phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA in early and moderate preterm infants (≥29 to &amp;lt;35 weeks gestational age [GA]) and late preterm and full-term infants (≥35 weeks GA) entering their first RSV season. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive a single 105 mg dose of ENFLONSIA (N=2,411) or saline placebo (N=1,203) by intramuscular (IM) injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary endpoint was the incidence of participants with RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infection (MALRI) characterized as cough or difficulty breathing and requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI (wheezing, rales/crackles) or severity (chest wall in-drawing/retractions, hypoxemia, tachypnea, dehydration due to respiratory symptoms) from Day 1 through Day 150 (5 months) after dosing. Medically attended includes all health care provider visits in settings such as outpatient clinic, clinical study site, emergency department, urgent care center and/or hospital. The key secondary endpoint was RSV-associated hospitalization through Day 150 (5 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial demonstrated that the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants entering their first RSV season was generally comparable to placebo. The most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema occurring within 5 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 3.8%; placebo: 3.3%), injection-site swelling occurring within 5 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 2.7%; placebo: 2.6%) and rash occurring within 14 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 2.3%; placebo: 1.9%). Participants were monitored for serious adverse events (SAEs) through the duration of their participation for up to 365 days post-dose. Most (≥97%) of the adverse reactions were toxicity grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SMART trial (MK-1654-007) (&lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04938830%3Fintr%3DClesrovimab%26rank%3D3&amp;amp;esheet=54271340&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250609303937&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=NCT04938830&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=e35858ee892e471e42dc431ade70ecef" rel="nofollow"&gt;NCT04938830&lt;/a&gt;) was a Phase 3, randomized, partially-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multi-site trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease, including early (&amp;lt;29 weeks GA) or moderate preterm infants (≥29 to ≤35 weeks GA) and infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease of any GA. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive ENFLONSIA (N=446) or palivizumab (N=450) by IM injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease and entering their first RSV season, the trial demonstrated that the safety profile of ENFLONSIA was generally comparable to palivizumab and consistent with the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants in the CLEVER trial. The efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease was established by extrapolation of efficacy of ENFLONSIA from the CLEVER trial to the SMART trial based on similar pharmacokinetic exposure. The incidence rates of RSV-associated MALRI requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI or severity and RSV-associated hospitalization were generally comparable between ENFLONSIA (3.6%, 95% CI: 2.0, 6.0 and 1.3%, 95% CI: 0.4, 2.9, respectively) and palivizumab (2.9%, 95% CI: 1.5, 5.2 and 1.5%, 95% CI: 0.5, 3.2, respectively) through Day 150 (5 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, when ENFLONSIA was given concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines, the safety profile of the co-administered regimen was generally comparable to the safety profile when ENFLONSIA and childhood vaccines were administered alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Merck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

			&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-most-effective-way-to-floss-your-teeth-requires-just-three-easy-steps"&gt;flossing is generally good&lt;/a&gt; for our oral health, but researchers from Tufts University in the United States have gone one step further, developing smart floss that monitors your stress levels as well as keeping your teeth and gums clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works through the use of a narrow channel in the floss, which draws in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;. The saliva is then passed over electrodes attached to the floss, before being analyzed by a built-in sensor, with readings transmitted to a phone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine?" &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/05/23/dental-floss-can-measure-stress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; electrical and computer engineer Sameer Sonkusale, from Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smart floss addresses one of the main problems with tracking stress: it's not all that easy to measure properly, with self-reporting and psychological tests susceptible to bias, and current cortisol analysis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hsr.2023.100079"&gt;relying on blood samples&lt;/a&gt; and lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smart floss approach would be quicker, more convenient, and easier to fit into a daily routine. There's plenty of work still to do – this prototype was tested using a lab setup, not by people actually flossing – but there's definitely potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162972" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype.jpg" alt="Smart floss prototype" class="wp-image-162972 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162972" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The prototype device developed by researchers. (Atul Sharma/Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the invention is a material called eMIP (or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coelec.2020.09.007"&gt;electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymer&lt;/a&gt;) that enables the device to recognize cortisol. It's a bit like a microscopic plaster cast, made to fit a specific shape – in this case, the shape of cortisol molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eMIP massively cuts down on the work and expense normally required to develop a biosensor like this. What's more, it was shown to be very accurate in tests – the researchers found it was as good as any other current sensor at detecting cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="162969" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; or receptors," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/05/23/dental-floss-can-measure-stress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sonkusale. "If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means the system can be easily adapted to detect other biological markers too, like tracking hormone levels for fertility or glucose levels to monitor diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162974" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162974" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration.jpg" alt="Smart floss illustration" class="wp-image-162974 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162974" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cortisol readings could be transmitted to a smartphone app. (Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of us will come under stresses and strains of some type or other during the day, chronic, long-term stress is a significant health issue. It can often increase the risk of other serious conditions, including cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. It's also linked to mental health problems, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mindfulness-can-rival-antidepressants-for-anxiety-study-finds"&gt;including anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="162969" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers do note some limitations in their device, aside from it being early in its development. They see the smart floss as being of most use in monitoring a health condition rather than diagnosing it in the first place – not least because saliva biomarkers can vary between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For diagnostics, blood is still the gold standard," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/05/23/dental-floss-can-measure-stress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sonkusale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you are diagnosed and put on medication, if you need to track, say, a cardiovascular condition over time to see if your heart health is improving, then monitoring with the sensor can be easy and allows for timely interventions when needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c02988"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patients came in with high cholesterol. And it was the kind that clings stubbornly to arteries and shadows families for generations. They walked into a clinical trial and left, perhaps, with a glimpse of the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early results from a small study, a single infusion of an experimental medicine called VERVE-102 cut levels of LDL cholesterol — the so-called “bad cholesterol” — by as much as 69%. And it did so not with daily pills or monthly injections, but with a one-time genetic edit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is reality; it’s not science fiction. We’re actually doing it,” said Dr. Riyaz Patel, a cardiologist at University College London, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/new-cholesterol-treatment-could-be-revolutionary-verve"&gt;for the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="flipping-a-genetic-switch"&gt;Flipping a genetic switch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Globally, almost half the adult population suffers &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/3236"&gt;from high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. While we have drugs like statins that can lower cholesterol, you need to take them daily. But VERVE-102 is no ordinary drug. It’s a form of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; base editing — a precise method of rewriting DNA without breaking the genetic code. This particular edit targets PCSK9, a gene that helps regulate how efficiently the liver clears out LDL cholesterol from the blood. Fewer PCSK9 proteins mean more LDL receptors on liver cells, and less cholesterol clogging the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The early trial, known as Heart-2, enrolled 14 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a genetic disorder that leads to dangerously high cholesterol levels from an early age. These weren’t your average patients with a bad diet, they often require lifelong therapy and still face an elevated risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each participant received a single intravenous infusion of VERVE-102, which packages the gene editor inside a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) designed to deliver it directly to the liver. There were no reported side effects and no signs of liver damage in any participant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers gave participants three different doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At 0.3 mg/kg, patients saw a &lt;strong&gt;21% reduction&lt;/strong&gt; in LDL cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At 0.45 mg/kg, the reduction averaged &lt;strong&gt;41%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;At 0.6 mg/kg, LDL dropped &lt;strong&gt;53% on average&lt;/strong&gt;, with one patient achieving a &lt;strong&gt;69% reduction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are extremely promising results, despite the study being in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-could-be-huge"&gt;Why this could be huge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol, a waxy substance essential for the body, becomes a killer when it accumulates in arteries, forming plaques that can rupture and cause heart attacks or strokes. Lowering LDL is one of the most effective ways to prevent these events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VERVE-102 was designed initially for people with inherited high cholesterol, but its underlying mechanism — &lt;em&gt;permanently switching off the PCSK9 gene&lt;/em&gt; — could be relevant to anyone struggling with high LDL cholesterol. PCSK9 plays a central role in regulating how much LDL the liver can remove from the bloodstream. Inhibiting this gene helps lower cholesterol in almost anyone, regardless of their genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, many existing cholesterol-lowering drugs, like PCSK9 inhibitors, already target the same protein. The difference is that VERVE-102 aims to make that change permanent, with a single treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-study-is-still-needed"&gt;More study is still needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/14/3060774/0/en/Verve-Therapeutics-Announces-Positive-Initial-Data-from-the-Heart-2-Phase-1b-Clinical-Trial-of-VERVE-102-an-In-Vivo-Base-Editing-Medicine-Targeting-PCSK9.html"&gt;initial results of the clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; have not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to test higher doses. Two patients in the 0.7 mg/kg cohort have already received VERVE-102. So far, no red flags have emerged. Verve expects to release full results from this dose escalation phase later this year and begin a Phase 2 trial — a larger test that will include U.S. patients for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is watching closely. It has the right to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug if it chooses to “opt in.” That decision is expected in the second half of 2025, when we should also have more data on the effectiveness of this treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This treatment is not a cure for everyone with high cholesterol. But it could be a lifeline for those struggling with it the most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In some, they’re a sign of a more serious condition known as dementia. “Dementia is a decline in brain function that leads to confusion, memory loss, mood changes and, in some instances, loss or decline of bodily functions,” says&lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. While genetics and age play a role in the risk of dementia, other lifestyle factors like diet, exercise and sleep are also linked to the condition.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately for many of us, there’s one food that may protect against mental decline: dark chocolate. Dark chocolate’s star ingredient, cocoa, is packed with flavonols, which may benefit brain health and function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But the source and quantity of cocoa matter. Keep reading to learn how cocoa can benefit your brain.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like many other plants, cocoa contains plant compounds called flavanols, which have antioxidant properties. “These flavanols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and they’re especially known for supporting blood flow and keeping blood vessels healthy,” says&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thewholesomeself/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Ghida Arnaout, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Cocoa flavanols may be particularly helpful for the brain, as they can protect against loss of neurons and other forms of inflammation in the brain. “They protect cells from oxidative damage and reduce inflammation throughout your body and brain,” says&lt;a href="https://cravingsomethinghealthy.com/about/about-anne-danahy-nutritionist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Anne Danahy, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A major benefit of cocoa flavanols is that they protect blood vessels, allowing them to relax and dilate more easily as blood pumps through,” says Danahy. “With healthier blood vessels, blood flow to the brain is improved, enabling more oxygen and nutrients to reach brain cells while also allowing waste to be removed. That’s particularly important for reducing dementia risk, because restricted blood and oxygen can damage brain cells or parts of the brain, triggering cognitive decline or vascular dementia.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies have shown a protective effect against insulin resistance with a diet rich in flavanols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When insulin is too high, blood flow can become constricted, which negatively affects brain function. While research has found an association between insulin resistance and cognitive health, the mechanism by which insulin resistance affects cognitive function and dementia is still being studied.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While chocolate bars and other sweetened chocolate treats like cakes and cookies are common sources of cocoa, they’re also often high in added sugar. But when it comes to cognitive health, too much added sugar can be a concern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Considering the cocoa source and form can help with moderating added sugar in the diet while also offering protective benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, we can’t just eat chocolate and expect to lower our risk of dementia. The brain is a complex organ that’s influenced by many lifestyle factors. Following these strategies can help reduce the risk of dementia.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation and support the structure of brain cell membranes, which is key for brain function,” says Arnaout. These unsaturated fats are found in a variety of foods often lacking in the typical American diet. Foods like fish, nuts and seeds all contribute to&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; upping omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; in the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seafood, nuts and seeds is one of the best ways to preserve your brain health,” says Ali. This doesn’t mean you need to eat a pescatarian or vegetarian diet. But adding more plants to your plate can offer increased nutrient diversity and anti-inflammatory compounds that benefit your brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A physically active lifestyle benefits all aspects of your health, including cognitive function. Studies have found a significant association between greater amounts of physical activity and lower dementia risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Find ways to stay active, whether via planned exercise or as part of daily living (such as with active transport), to benefit cognitive health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleeping less than five to six hours per night can increase the risk of dementia, especially in those 50 years of age or older.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The brain depends on sleep to process information, store memories and remove waste.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By prioritizing quality sleep, you allow your brain to rest and recharge while ultimately lowering your risk for dementia over the long term.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many, eating chocolate is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Fortunately, that bit of enjoyment may offer health benefits beyond satisfaction and enjoyment. Including cocoa in a nutrient-dense, balanced diet may stave off dementia risk with aging. Other lifestyle habits like getting enough sleep and staying physically active can also help prevent cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;

So she posted on Facebook that she had been affected by a reduction in force, or RIF. A month later in a conversation with a friend, Binion mentioned the fact that she had lost her job. He reacted in total shock. "I thought that was an April Fool's joke," Binion's friend said of her Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMHSA (pronounced sam-sah), which is housed under the Department of Health and Human Services, might not be a familiar acronym to most people. The agency supports Americans who suffer from mental health conditions and who experience addiction. SAMHSA operates the 988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline, which has received more than &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/988/performance-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;14.5 million calls, texts, and messages&lt;/a&gt; since it launched in July 2022. The agency also assists communities with grants for treatment and recovery centers, especially in rural areas where long distances from treatment centers act as a barrier to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has proposed &lt;a href="https://doctorsforamerica.org/sr-samhsa-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rescinding&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in funding from SAMHSA, cuts that will reduce the agency's workforce by 50 percent. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to create a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, and &lt;a href="https://www.naatp.org/advocacy/public-policy/major-federal-agency-change-announced-today-administration-healthy-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; multiple agencies including SAMHSA. These cuts face pending legal challenges, and Binion's termination was delayed after a judge's preliminary injunction. "I don't think people understood how much SAMHSA did," Binion said. "And a lot of the programs are being destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Binion about her personal connection to mental health work, the value of peer support in the recovery process, and her fears around policy decisions made without robust data. (Binion spoke with me from her position as an individual, not on behalf of SAMHSA or any government agency.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in working in public health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always wanted to help people, so I wanted to be a social worker. My dad said no to that, because [he said] they're burnt out and they don't make money. He wanted me to go in business, and I refused to do that. Anyway, I love education. My mom's an educator, so I got my degree in community health education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was raised in Prince George's County Maryland. Prince George's County Maryland was, for years ... the wealthiest black community in the entire country. One of the reasons why we were the wealthiest black community was just location. The reason for that is a lot of people—I would say 90 percent of my family—worked for the federal government. Everybody was outside of D.C. The federal government was a stable job. ... So growing up, the message from my father was, get a federal job. Get a federal job. Get a federal job. It's the most stable, and you're going to have the best benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked in a hospital for a few years. I worked at the Baltimore City Health Department. When the Affordable Care Act went through in 2010, they added a lot of jobs to CMS, which is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. So I said, "Oh, I'm going to apply there." It took me four years to get into CMS. People don't realize how hard it is getting into the federal government. But I got in there, and I said, OK, I love it. I'm where I was supposed to be. I'm doing public service. ... I had to be what's called a contractor officer representative, or a COR. Basically you're overseeing all the contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years into me being at CMS, my daughter had [psychiatric and mental health challenges], and [was diagnosed with] a serious mental illness. I was thrown into complete chaos. A mental disorder was not even in my periphery. I was out of work a lot. We're in year three or four of this, and my daughter's been hospitalized 10 times. ... Because I was thrown into mental health because of lived experience, I decided to switch my career to SAMHSA. Because I started seeing the cracks in the systems. But then I also saw some of the good parts in the system. I took a lot of classes just to better get ahold of my daughter. We have an awesome relationship now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went into CBHSQ at SAMHSA, which is the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. I now have a certification in trauma. I also have a certification in crisis support, I started to do trauma-informed care. The goal was to better my relationship with my daughter. But then I realized that I liked it, and then I started running support groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAMHSA really focuses on co-occurring substance abuse disorders and serious serious mental illness. Thank God they really focused on peer recovery support. These are all the types of things I've run into just from the lived experience with my daughter. Peer recovery support is, "I've had a mental illness, I'm in recovery. I had substance use disorder, I'm in recovery. And now I'm working to help people as they find their way through their journey." What I learned with my daughter was, these doctors and nurses, they will come in, but she's like, they don't know what I'm going through. But when you have a peer there, there's a level of empathy peers can give that other people can't give. ... SAMHSA put out this idea: We should have people in recovery actually giving the services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have this churn between hospital, homelessness, and jail, right? A lot of people with serious mental illness or a substance use disorder will go through this kind of churn. CBHSQ, the center that I was in, they did a lot of data collection. The data that we collected informed other programs and SAMHSA and also informed the public. They came up with jail diversion programs. I just did a support group, and a parent is in there. He's like, "Oh, my son's in jail again." ... I'm like, what happened? "Oh, he walked into a Walgreens naked." What about that screams, &lt;em&gt;arrest this man&lt;/em&gt;? He's in psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[One service at] the Office of Treatment Services, it was &lt;a href="https://findtreatment.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FindTreatment.gov&lt;/a&gt;. We have a survey called &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/n-sumhss-national-substance-use-and-mental-health-services-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;N-SUMHSS&lt;/a&gt;, which is the National Survey of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. We're collecting all the data [from] all the facilities. So if you actually go to FindTreatment.gov ... they have a lot of filters. They say, here's the substance abuse facility near your house. Here's the insurance they accept. They [RIFed] all of us who run that program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you talk about what an average day looked like for you in your role at the Office of Treatment Services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on DAWN as [one of] the [contracting officer representatives.] ... DAWN stands for &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/dawn-drug-abuse-warning-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drug Abuse Warning Network&lt;/a&gt;. So what SAMHSA did, along in partnership with our contractor, is that we contracted with hospitals and emergency departments all over the country. We would go into the hospitals, and ... collect all of their data, [such as] emergency room visits based on some type of substance, any type of substance. But of course, a lot of the numbers that we saw were illicit drugs. So that could be either meth or heroin. There was a whole list. We monitored all the new drugs that we've seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another part of my job was to help write the different manuscripts. They asked me to help because of my lived experience. The manuscript that I was working on before we got RIFed ... was state hospitals and psychiatric readmissions. So we're looking at the readmission rates and factors that either help or hurt the readmission rates, like a low number of beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had so many different aspects of DAWN. From training the hospitals, to recruiting the hospitals, to training the abstractors, to looking at all the data that's coming through and trying to make a story of the data. Here are the new drugs we're seeing. We also wanted to be a real surveillance system where we had early warning. Early warning is that we have something called [a] sentinel hospital, which is a hospital in an area ... that's known to have high overdose stats. So we would collect data from that hospital, and we would see some of the new drugs that were coming. So we could say, [as a hypothetical example], hey, Minnesota, hey Minneapolis, we're starting to see a mix of Seroquel and meth. That's the new mixture that we're seeing ... Let's just say five patients in four weeks came through with the overdose of this new mixture, right? ... This combination of drug could be an issue. Then we would look to see what, DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, what are you seeing on the streets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would love if you could share your experience of learning about your termination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at CMS during [Trump's] first term. That's what happens when you work for the federal government. No matter who's in office, you still have to serve the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February is when we started to get scared, and it just became toxic and chaotic. ... Everybody was shaking in their boots. My boss had to keep saying, we're going to go on like it's everyday business as usual. Then one time we had a meeting, she was like, "Yeah, we're gonna have this meeting on April 1 [assuming we're still here]." We were like, what? We're like, OK, are we getting RIFed? We don't know. So I think for the entire month of March, people were ready. Oh, we're going to get the RIF notices this week. Oh, we're going to get the RIF notices next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many people in SAMHSA work for SAMHSA for the exact same reason I work for SAMHSA. Because you have lived experience, either with a family member or with yourself. The &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/about/offices-centers/or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Office of Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, I would say a lot of them have lived experience. I don't think people just wake up one day and be like, I want to work for SAMHSA. A lot of people don't even know SAMHSA exists, right? ... SAMHSA had organizational groups, and one was a lived experience group. I was in that group, and a lot of them were like, yeah, we have to really implement our coping skills. Because recovery is an ongoing, lifelong thing, right? You have to actively stay in recovery. You would have some people like, "Yeah, I have upped my AA meetings from once a month to once a week now. Because I'm stressed. This anxiety is triggering a lot." It was very demoralizing. You feel like you're not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I didn't go into the office only because I have multiple sclerosis. So I got a reasonable accommodation. ... A lot of people at SAMHSA, they've had lived experience. And people just have health issues. [Because of] all this stress, I had MS flare ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did it on April 1. ... I woke up and I had eight messages from different coworkers. What happened was, so the building that SAMHSA and HRSA ... the Health Resource Services Administration. I think HRSA is in there. The Indian Health Services is in there. So I think it's three main government and NIH is next to us. And one of the NIH buildings are next to us. You got three different agencies trying to get in one building. This is in Rockville [Maryland]. It took them two hours to get into the building—[the] line was &lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;. This is how people knew: They would badge in, and if it was red, you were RIFed. You just hear people break down and cry. That took up the entire line. You just hear people wailing and screaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to just check if there was any other personal aspect to [your RIF] that you'd want to share?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I took it for granted that the federal government has the best health care. I have multiple sclerosis. My drug is $80,000 a year. My daughter has been hospitalized 10 times. I remember calling my physical therapist. I was like, Yeah, you know, I was RIFed. I said, "Come June and I might have to switch my health insurance to United." They were like, but you have Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal. I was like, yeah. They were like, you know there's no other health insurance better than that, right? I said, "I know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run support groups, and all the cuts they're doing to SAMHSA, they're saying, "Oh, well, this was under DEI, right." But who's suffering? Who's dying? Who has a lot of the mental health issues? Who's disproportionately affected by mental illness and substance use? Yeah, it would be the populations that a lot of the DEI was targeting. Mind you, one of the main populations that went under DEI was rural [communities]. ... We had a good focus on the rural community, because they're not near the big city, and there was a whole [issue of] access to care. I'm really concerned for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's going to take a long time for me to find another job. The financial insecurity is at times overwhelming. The destruction of SAMHSA was also very, very, very depressing. My concern is the infrastructure that SAMHSA has built, 20-plus years [of] building, their influence—they've made real systemic change. Especially with the early psychosis program. Especially with some of their family. Especially with 988, [the suicide and crisis hotline] was huge. Instead of calling 911 for a mental health crisis, call 988, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if I don't go back to SAMHSA or the federal government, I'll still be working in mental health. And I feel like this is going to make everything worse. I partner with NAMI, which is the National Alliance of Mental Illness, and they usually almost never comment on anything political. But they're out here saying we're concerned for the cuts to Medicaid, for the cuts to all the mental health block grants. The safeguards for behavioral health, the framework, this is a lot of complex needs, high needs population. I'm very, very concerned on what's going to happen with the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you foresee any immediate impacts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the data that we're collecting on all the healthcare systems, the opioid crisis, all that, the different substances, the psychosis, again, serious mental illness, we collect a lot of data on that—the data informs [policy.] We're not just making arbitrary political decisions, right? This goes for CMS too. At CMS we never, ever made a decision or wrote any type of policy without having some type of research or data, right? The data informs sound policy decisions. And I'm scared that that's going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's so ironic about all this is SAMHSA was signed into law by [George H.W.] Bush, a Republican, and it was introduced to Congress by Edward Kennedy ... RFK, he's had past substance use struggles. We really thought, oh, well, RFK comes in, [and] he's going to really support us. ... ... But when it comes to mental health, he should be on board, right? SAMHSA has just been so instrumental in reducing the opioid overdose deaths. We've established the 988 mental health crisis response. ... We collect national data on mental health and substance use. We were really promoting the peer workforce. People with lived experience, let's get them in there. And we did it. We were looking at underage drinking. We were looking at youth with psychosis, with the early intervention programs. This infrastructure is going to be completely disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're scared that some of the key programs are going to be eliminated. One of the reasons why I decided to [do this] interview is because I said, I don't think people realize how much SAMHSA did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when people who need services come in? What's going to happen to FindTreatment.gov when people are looking for services in their area? We're supposed to be a credible, trusted source. The government, your government, that you pay, is supposed to be a .. credible, trusted source. And I'm scared we're going to lose that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Defector</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQWlphMFVjNm1MSDk1LTB6UHlFc1FJUEthNk9mQVNsbkdqaXpTek9GMmNUdzRKb2c1aTFWY0Q3VkIzaEFXMjR6bnY4bi14ZDJDVUc2bzFzMlgzR3lfTnh5ajZnZnpZN3RSQlhtdkVEcnhjcm9hazdIQnVZdmZiRzB1VHB2VU9zbUZyUVRIMkxqdEN4bjhKUWY5LUo2MU5WS0QyWmlqZ2pTNnZIdl9VV3A5RGNwcG5Sdw</guid></item><item><title>营养师推荐的6种有助于降低胆固醇的最佳谷物- EatingWell | The 6 Best Cereals to Help Lower Cholesterol, Recommended by Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5kaUdTNzhzS1F5amJhcmxGbkxpMWVac1pFZ3JPVjRuZHBEbEdsY01IMU1sdGc3XzNvWjJEZzRqbzNhWTlkQnVyU0NMYUxzMk5ZUThObUpaZjVPdWdMWWxpVlBWall6d0lDd29ET3lqRzJXRlRlWFZyN3pR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-fiber breakfast cereals that are low in added sugars may help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheerios, Catalina Crunch and Kashi are among the six cholesterol-lowering cereals recommended by dietitians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s best to talk with a health care professional before making any changes to your diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cereal may seem like a humble breakfast choice, but certain boxes on grocery store shelves can do more than just quell your hunger—they may also help lower your cholesterol. And considering &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; increases your risk of health issues like heart attack and stroke, making simple healthy swaps in your daily routine can go a long way in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-heart-health-8610881" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protecting your heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cereals [can be] beneficial for cholesterol reduction primarily due to their high soluble fiber content, especially beta-glucan, which is found in oats and other whole grains,” says &lt;a href="https://www.blissfulnutrition365.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ambrazia Sublett, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She adds, “Here, this fiber acts like a ‘toothbrush’ in your arteries, sweeping away excess fat particles (cholesterol) in the bloodstream.” In other words, certain breakfast cereals may help reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels and promote a more ideal ratio of HDL (“good”) cholesterol to LDL cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all cereals are created equal, though. To make sense of the health claims and nutrition labels, we spoke with three registered dietitians to find out which cereals may actually help lower your cholesterol levels and deserve a spot at &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8022936/best-breakfast-for-high-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the breakfast table&lt;/a&gt;. Here are six cereals to consider buying the next time you’re at the supermarket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-old-fashioned-rolled-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072346/whole-grain-to-eat-for-better-heart-health-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best choices you can make for heart health&lt;/a&gt;, says Sublett.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They’re packed with beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that helps lower LDL cholesterol. Just make sure you’re using the plain kind—no added sugar, no extra stuff,” she adds. Of course, what you pair with your cereal also makes a difference. “Try adding fruits with the skin, like apples or pears, for an extra boost of fiber. And when it comes to milk, go for options that are low in added sugar, whether that’s almond, oat or regular dairy,” Sublett recommends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-cheerios-original-and-honey-nut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Cheerios (Original and Honey Nut) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheerios are one of the most accessible ways to get &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering fiber&lt;/a&gt; into your diet—especially if you’re short on time or don’t love hot cereal. “Even Honey Nut Cheerios, though a little sweeter, still carry some of those benefits,” says Sublett.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to pouring yourself a bowl at breakfast, Cheerios also work well as a topper for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-high-protein-snack-for-better-heart-health-8764499" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; for a boost of fiber and protein at snack time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-kelloggs-all-bran-bran-buds"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Kellogg’s All-Bran Bran Buds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kellogg’s All-Bran Bran Buds contain psyllium and oat bran—two dynamos in cholesterol reduction. “Psyllium combined with oat bran creates a synergistic soluble fiber matrix that can further reduce LDL cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://www.elitebodydata.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yaa Boakye, RDN, LDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. She adds, “Psyllium is known to act via increased bile acid excretion and may enhance oat beta-glucan’s effects.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from beta-glucan, Boakye says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; is another powerhouse soluble fiber that’s effective for binding and lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Look for cereals specifically mentioning ‘psyllium’ or ‘psyllium husk’ as a primary ingredient,” says Boakye.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-kashi-organic-honey-toasted-oat-cereal"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Kashi Organic Honey Toasted Oat Cereal &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kashi Organic Honey Toasted Oat Cereal is another great pick, thanks to its base of whole oat flour and oat fiber, which contribute beta-glucans. &lt;a href="https://nutritionbymegan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Huff, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt; also highlights the cereal’s 6 grams of fiber and 0 grams of saturated fat per serving. For lowering cholesterol levels, she recommends looking for cereals with less than 4 grams of saturated fat, since high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; intake is linked with elevated LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-catalina-crunch-cinnamon-toast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Catalina Crunch Cinnamon Toast  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 9 grams of fiber, 11 grams of protein and no added sugars, Catalina Crunch Cinnamon Toast Cereal is the perfect balanced breakfast, Huff says. “Fiber helps lower LDL cholesterol, and limiting added sugars is important because too much can raise triglycerides and decrease HDL (‘good’) cholesterol levels,” she explains. While this cereal isn’t cheap, you might be able to save money by buying it in bulk at Costco. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-post-original-shredded-wheat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Post Original Shredded Wheat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a high-fiber option with nothing added, Post Plain Shredded Wheat is a great pick, offering 8 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein per serving. “It’s made from 100% whole wheat and has zero added sugar—just fiber doing its thing,” says Sublett. She also points to a study where regular consumption of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-grain cereals&lt;/a&gt;, like this plain shredded wheat, was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating cereal isn’t just convenient—it can be an effective (and tasty) step toward lowering your cholesterol levels. Look for options made with whole grains, especially those high in soluble fiber. Keeping added sugars and saturated fats to a minimum is also important. “More than 8 grams of added sugar per serving, excessive sodium (above 200 milligrams per serving) and artificial trans fats (listed as ‘partially hydrogenated oils’) can counteract potential cholesterol benefits,” says Boakye. Whether you prefer a warm bowl of oats or a crunchy, high-fiber cold cereal, building heart-healthy habits can start with a single scoop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just keep in mind that you should always talk with a health care professional before making any changes to your diet, especially if you’re taking cholesterol-lowering medications. “Certain medications, particularly those that work by binding bile acids, may interact with high-fiber foods and could affect the absorption of both the medication and nutrients.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413811122" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this week in &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; reveals a previously unknown peripheral mechanism by which paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen, Tylenol, or Panadol) relieves pain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study was led by Prof. Alexander Binshtok from the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine and Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) and Prof. Avi Priel from its School of Pharmacy. Together, they uncovered a surprising new way that paracetamol—one of the world's most common painkillers—actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that paracetamol relieved &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; by working only in the brain and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spinal+cord/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. But this new research shows that the drug also works outside the brain, in the nerves that first detect pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their discovery centers on a substance called AM404, which the body makes after taking paracetamol. The team found that AM404 is produced right in the pain-sensing nerve endings—and that it works by shutting off specific channels (called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sodium+channels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sodium channels&lt;/a&gt;) that help transmit pain signals. By blocking these channels, AM404 stops the pain message before it even starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've shown that AM404 works directly on the nerves outside the brain," said Prof. Binshtok. "It changes our entire understanding of how paracetamol fights pain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough could also lead to new types of painkillers. Because AM404 targets only the nerves that carry pain, it may avoid the numbness, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/muscle+weakness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/a&gt;, and side effects that come with traditional local anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can develop new drugs based on AM404, we might finally have pain treatments that are highly effective but also safer and more precise," added Prof. Priel.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, multiple studies have linked this eating pattern to a reduced risk of dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study says that following the MIND diet may help lower a person’s risk for developing dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, even if they don’t start following the diet until later in life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These benefits were especially seen in participants who identified as African-American, Latino, or white.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies have shown that certain lifestyle changes — such as &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institute on Aging" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;following a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; — may help lower a person’s risk for developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its emphasis on brain-healthy foods, past studies have suggested that following the MIND diet may decrease a person’s risk for &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, more generally, and &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dementia and mortality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, more specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study presented at &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, reports that following the MIND diet may help lower a person’s risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, even if they don’t start following the diet until later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits were especially seen in participants who identified as&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;African American, Latino, or white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is yet to undergo peer review and appear in a specialised journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers analyzed dietary data from almost 93,000 U.S. adults between the ages of 45 to 75, who participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.uhcancercenter.org/for-researchers/mec-cohort-composition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Multiethnic Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;, which began in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were from five racial and ethnic groups — African American, Latino, white, Native Hawaiian, and Asian American. Scientists scored each participant’s adherence to MIND diet principles based on a food frequency questionnaire provided at the start of the study and again 10 years later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MIND diet includes 10 brain-healthy and 5 brain-unhealthy food groups,” &lt;a href="https://www.uhcancercenter.org/park-song-yi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Song-Yi Park&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, associate professor of the Population Sciences in the Pacific Program at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We calculated the MIND diet score using Morris’ methods in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. We examined several healthy dietary patterns and found more consistent results with the MIND diet compared to other dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean, DASH, and &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp/healthy-eating-index-hei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Park and her team found that study participants with the highest MIND diet scores at the start of the study had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That reduced risk rate jumped to 13% for participants identifying as white, Latino, or African American. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies were mostly conducted in White populations,” Park explained. “Our study confirms the protective association in a more diverse population. We have no clear explanation for the observed racial/ethnic heterogeneity. Differences in dietary patterns and preferences could play a role. Also, the MIND diet may not fully capture the benefits of ethnic diets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also discovered that study participants who improved their adherence to the MIND diet over 10 years — including those who at first did not closely follow this dietary pattern — decreased their dementia risk by 25%, compared to those whose MIND diet compliance declined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life and their improvement over time may prevent Alzheimer’s and related dementias,” Park said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the burden of dementia is increasing and the pharmacological treatments are still very limited, Park said reducing modifiable risk factors to prevent the disease is a public health priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving diet quality at older ages is still beneficial for preventing dementia,” she continued. “We plan to explore individual dietary components that can better capture ethnically tailored healthy dietary patterns and optimal intake levels.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/neurology/ca/santa-monica/clifford-segil-1457556581" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.providence.org/doctors/neurology/ca/santa-monica/clifford-segil-1457556581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Clifford Segil&lt;/a&gt;, DO, a neurologist in private practice in Santa Monica, CA, and on staff at Providence St. John’s Health Center, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish I agreed that leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, and olive oil were proven brain healthy foods as these are definitely healthy for your heart, but less clearly for your brain,” Segil, who was not involved in the research, commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that eating healthy throughout your life can help reduce your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295385" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hyperlipidemia&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, and first-time &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151444" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7624" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;.

Do you know how to shop for, prepare, or consume these foods? Are you able to access a variety of these foods? What other tools may be helpful for you to incorporate these into your life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Feed your mind — following dietary patterns such as the MIND diet are only part of the equation,” she also advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 16:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPcElQMjM1V3F6TDlGam1SM01feVMwNmZnVGhjMWNlc0pmXzhweEZVR0xLa2IyTnRBVnVRcTRYMjN2OEh6Wmx1VFp1cFZEQ2tMS25SVFhZY1ZtUFl5VFl0bERpUXBoQ0VvUlAyV1d1eDhYUkdYX0tfa1BORC03a2plcW5MaW5sUDFRLS1QMk54WS1tT1VaSTFEUUJ5d01tSFpxZjJPSnVORTB1Q3E5b0F2eVloMA</guid></item><item><title>限制商店购买的婴儿食品，政府告诉家长- BBC | Restrict shop-bought baby food, government tells parents - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1LUDdwdmxkeHZwM3dyMWtkYVE5OXI5dTJZZlBYclpjWDJjR2NLVEtycWRKSHJINnJxS3E4cDdNSWRiWlYzMmItajZ6Q2VULXM2bHMtbnZiOTEwZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE91TDhBVGc1Q0xPeVR4aHlJR2xCN2ltbDNRd2hBc3ZRYUg1bW9BdHBXRkx2bDU3NHBlMm1xQXZYaDQxenZ1R3JRdHgxM05fZ1JZUVhqa2U5blBoa0h1Vkdv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Restrict shop-bought baby food, government tells parents&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Adam Eley &amp;amp; Catrin Nye&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f183/live/7985b210-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A toddler with blondey-brown hair sucking a pouch of baby food, which she is holding with both hands.

Baby food snacks - such as puffs and sticks - have grown in popularity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Baby weaning expert and author Charlotte Stirling-Reed told the BBC it was "about time that this was addressed... because food pouches and commercial baby foods are used so much by parents. It was a real gap in the NHS advice until now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Vicky Sibson, director of the charity First Steps Nutrition Trust which campaigns for improvements in shop-bought baby foods, told the BBC that without clear advice it can be "confusing for parents" when they see shop-bought products marketed as being "just as good" as homemade foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Charlotte Stirling-Reed says it's important parents are given the whole picture when deciding how to feed their young children&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In April, BBC Panorama looked at the baby food pouches of six leading companies. The products have become a staple for many households with babies and children up to the age of two or three. They are convenient and have long shelf lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But experts believe the products should only be used sparingly, are not replacements for homemade meals, and can cause children health problems if used as their main source of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;When this was put to some of the leading brands, the market leader Ella's Kitchen told the BBC it agreed with all three points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The other brands featured in the investigation – Heinz, Piccolo, Little Freddie, Aldi and Lidl - said their products were intended as a complementary part of a child's varied weaning diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The NHS Start For Life website also now states that parents should wait until their baby is around six months old before feeding them solid foods, even if labels say the products are suitable from four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Currently, among the brands investigated by Panorama, the companies Piccolo, Ella's Kitchen and Aldi promote their fruit-based pouches to babies as young as four months, despite the NHS and World Health Organization saying babies should not be given solid food until about the age of six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since Panorama began its investigation, all three companies said they are rebranding their products as suitable from six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Baby food regulations 'need updating'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Sibson believes the government should now look to introduce stronger mandatory regulations for companies producing commercial baby foods to improve the suitability of the products for young children and regulate how they are marketed to parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC "current laws already set strong standards for baby food and we support action against any products that don't meet them".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The British Retail Consortium says companies "take great care to optimise the nutritional composition of these products.

But the scale of the outbreak in Ontario could overturn that achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since October, Canada’s most populous province has reported more than 2,000 cases – more than all of those in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States combined in 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health figures show cases continue to climb despite efforts to quell the rise. Last week, the outbreak reached a grim milestone after the province recorded its first fatality. Moore told the media a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/canada-premature-infant-measles-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;premature baby, who contracted measles in utero&lt;/a&gt;, died from medical complications, including the presence of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s only a very small subgroup of people who have chosen not to get vaccinated who are having the complications,” he said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the vaccine is not recommended once a person is pregnant – in part because it contains a live virus that could be passed on to the fetus – public health groups recommend unvaccinated pregnant people get one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin if they are exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people, if they don’t want a vaccine, they may not want the immunoglobulin either. That may be a philosophical choice,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore said that Canada’s high levels of vaccination had nonetheless blunted what could be a far worse outbreak, giving large swaths of the population protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I know some will concentrate on the glass being half-empty. You know, to have that level of protection in the face of the risks globally, I think is quite an accomplishment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxONWp3NmhKaXJGNU96REFORWtORTU0MDAtT0JBakVoX3d1RlVMZzV0REhKMk1iYzF4dHoyNU15NmNZRWV6X3JYQWR6aDZSTlpYNS05ejZrUlFJV282ZVJrbmZsbzE4ZzIyVmZuMkdwRjFZOXA2TmUyeXFEeG1QT2F4bmt5Zw</guid></item><item><title>游泳瘙痒：它是什么以及如何治疗- kare11.com | Swimmer's itch: What it is and how to treat it - kare11.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxORU02dWp3ME02Sk1LVUlRUUtCcnFFejlGMFVrTEJBX0F4bHgxN2RpWDhKajU0ZEhQRWUxS0FCN3E5OWQwMGJSREQ5R0JkVDlSdHpDenJpXzVtdEphVEZVS1JmV213N2xuRkpNQ2JaWTJQWUdpU0gzUC1peHVDeGw1Vm1WNV9CYlFNWUtUTTh0cHRiQWswVl9Pa25GVlI4eWJqTG45YS1wejduS1FIaUtNTjAyNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;If you've lived in Minnesota during warm months, you've likely had the distinct pleasure of wanting to crawl out of your own skin after going for a dip in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't let these little buggers discourage you from enjoying summer! Learn more about what causes swimmer's itch and how to prevent it below. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is swimmer's itch?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic describes cercarial dermatitis, or swimmer's itch, as an itchy, red rash that can appear after swimming — primarily in freshwater lakes and ponds; however, it can also be present in saltwater.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash is caused by an allergic reaction to microscopic parasites carried by ducks, geese and other waterfowl; semi-aquatic mammals; and snails. The parasite's eggs, released into the water through animal waste, eventually find their way into infecting snails, where they live and grow until the snail releases them back into the water.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said once the parasites are released, they then burrow into another host, e.g., animals or people, causing an allergic reaction.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good news: The rash is temporary, as the parasite can't survive for long once it inhabits the human body. The severity of the infection also varies from person to person, based on a person's sensitivity, but the DNR notes you'll become more sensitive to it each time you're exposed. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I prevent swimmer's itch?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways to quell the nasty bug from infiltrating your serene weekend at the lake.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are recommendations from the DNR:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply waterproof sunscreen, skin oils and other emollients before entering the water to thwart the parasite from penetrating the skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from shore while swimming, as the organisms thrive in warm, shallow water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't let the water evaporate from your skin after getting out of the water. Towel off right away because parasites present in water droplets will look for a place to go as the water evaporates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discourage waterfowl from frequenting the areas near your dock and shoreline. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I do come into contact with swimmer's itch?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as a swimmer's itch survivor myself, I personally send my most heartfelt condolences — but condolences won't help you ditch the itch.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNR recommends these treatments for relief:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply an anti-itch lotion or corticosteroid cream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bathe in Epsom salts, baking soda or colloidal oatmeal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply cool compresses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't scratch! Scratching your rash could cause a secondary infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Also, it is expensive and misses diagnoses in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That could soon change, as several research groups, including Professor Metz’s, are developing simpler diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, researchers at the University of Oxford presented results of a clinical trial for a potentially game-changing test where the patient is injected with an agent that lights up endometriosis under a SPECT-CT scanner (widely used in hospitals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agent, 99mTc-maraciclatide, binds to a protein seen when new blood vessel are forming – the endometrial tissue forms new blood vessels so it can survive and grow. This agent emits radioactive rays that are detected by a SPECT-CT, which can reveal if there is endometriosis and exactly where it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers presented results of a clinical trial for a potentially game-changing test where the patient is injected with an agent that lights up endometriosis under a SPECT-CT scanner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results of the latest study, presented at the World Congress on Endometriosis in Sydney last month, showed that the light-up dye was as accurate as laparoscopy in detecting endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The results from the Oxford study suggest that maraciclatide can visualise the very early stage of endometriosis showing the extent, location and stage of disease which is currently only visible at surgery,’ a spokeswoman for the maker, Serac Healthcare, told Good Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It has the potential to eliminate the delays of up to nine years in diagnosis which women experience, as well as allowing them to avoid surgery.’ It could be available within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another test that should be available soon is PromarkerEndo, a blood test that detects the presence of ten proteins associated with endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study of 805 women, published in the journal Human Reproduction, showed it was able to distinguish those with severe endometriosis with more than 99 per cent accuracy, and those with early-stage endometriosis with 85 per cent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professor Christine Metz, of the Institute of Molecular Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s planned to launch in Australia later this year, costing £455 to £720; it’s not yet known when it will reach the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Professor Metz and colleagues are comparing menstrual ‘effluent’ (the woman’s period, which also contains endometrial tissues shed from the womb lining) of thousands of women with and without endometriosis in search of differences to turn into a diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advantage is that menstrual effluent can be collected non-invasively (and cheaply) at home and could be useful both in diagnosis and assessing how patients respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial published research identified that the menstrual effluent of women with endometriosis had different stromal cells (connective tissue cells from the womb lining) and more inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new trial, the US team will enrol women who &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6345593/Hope-millions-women-endometriosis-scientists-edge-one-step-closer-cure.html"&gt;have symptoms of endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; who are considering surgery in order to get a diagnosis. Professor Metz hopes this diagnostic test will be widely available within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The need for better diagnostic tests is clear. ‘A lengthy wait for diagnosis means a delay in accessing treatment, during which the disease may progress, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6893835/Why-does-7-years-detect-condition-plagues-women.html"&gt;leading to worsening symptoms and a risk of permanent organ damage&lt;/a&gt;,’ said Faye Farthing, head of campaigns and communications at Endometriosis UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It can also have a huge impact on mental health, potentially impacting on relationships, career and education.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mild-to-moderate endometriosis can be treated with anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, as well as contraceptives to suppress the release of oestrogen, which can promote tissue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, women may be offered surgery to remove the tissue but, in 50 per cent of cases, symptoms recur within five years. There is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, the National Institute for Care Excellence approved a daily pill, relugolix-estradiol-norethisterone (brand name: Ryeqo) for patients where surgical and other medical interventions haven’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It blocks hormones that contribute to endometriosis as well as providing hormone replacement to protect bone density and reduce other effects, as the drug puts the body into artificial menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, a second once-a-day pill, linzagolix (brand name: Yselty) was approved. It works by blocking specific hormones to stop the endometriosis development, but patients need to take separate hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:31:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNQzdGVGVtY1pRNERlX00yZnlLaUI4enhPRjF5Yk05UUlqMEsxRGdCWXZXaUQzREpTZmVKRzlZdFh3cHdHY19TUnBsNXA5aV9kWV95VFhKeVhUQUJyb0hTNElWN2J5MTFMXzdycEs2Q3pVSGVhdWJ4WVR2MFM1blFFaXVsVExVREljQ0hoWGgwTGpxMHVDckJrcmxLWEQzM2haVjdWdEttMmVoZkxWTWhtZFB3dTVJSmVRbE1FLVR5Y0VaOTdRTmRIYg</guid></item><item><title>可怕的地图揭示了会让你考虑搬家的痴呆集群-每日邮报 | Terrifying map reveals dementia clusters that'll make you consider moving - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOTmdvWkZyd1ZNVllNaERCZVdKSmU1cVVVc0d5c21YekVwTzlVUmt0U3NsSmRmRF9TLVpVYXRIZm03dU9LVjZmbjRUcUd2c2V4TGdUTWFjME5qeVJjZ1NFWk9aWTZ6MmlBN2hWMkZsVG9PakR2T04yVGZFMzkxWmpMRUlSaUczb0FJUlNrazFoQjUwOTBPRWU3OVhyNG9talFCV0HSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZLVVJNZi1TaU1qb1EtNkZxOHRRN280cHhZZHdPX1ZjbnE3Y3RRSjFoLWd0dFhsWFRxbFh1LXRkbWkzWms4TTU5amxYZTM4Q05kNHFhRnF6amZPcjNVQ1NvNHY5SFBsMENYTTBydmUtaEVUakxESDU3Vnc0Z3JtQXBjZUg2SW5BNnc4NWxVYzdtWjBKSXlzYU9abk9NNjc2bzliQndvRkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in the Rocky Mountains and Northwest US are among those with the highest risk of dementia, a study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in California split the US into 10 regions and compared dementia rates in each. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used the Mid-Atlantic region, which includes states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-ca463c40-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-ca45ee20-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-ca46d880-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, as a baseline for comparison because it had the lowest rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed people living in the Southeast - &lt;span&gt;which includes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2890-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tennessee/index.html" id="mol-ca46b170-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alabama/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2891-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mississippi/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2892-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; - were most likely to get dementia with a 25 percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were followed closely by northwest states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alaska/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c0-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/idaho/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c1-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and around the Rocky Mountains were at a 23 percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Southwestern states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c2-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; were 13 percent more likely to develop the condition, meanwhile those in northeast states like New York were the least likely - a seven percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), said the disparities are most likely due to socioeconomic factors like quality of education and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14719863/Scientists-discover-toxic-substance-hiding-100-peoples-brains-explains-rise-dementia-US.html"&gt;exposure to environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said while more research is needed, the findings show which areas of the country are most vulnerable to dementia and where efforts should be targeted for education, prevention and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams, pictured here, is one of the most famous faces of dementia.

The Southeast was at the greatest risk while Mid-Atlantic was the lowest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kristine Yaffe, senior study author, said: 'The study underscores the need to understand regional differences in dementia and the importance of region-specific prevention and intervention efforts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 8million adults in the US have some form of dementia and 500,000 are diagnosed every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimate cases will &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;grow by 1million per year by 2060&lt;/a&gt;, while some research suggests 12.7million patients could be diagnosed by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to cases being underreported, a growing aging population and surging rates of diseases like heart disease and obesity, which can weaken blood vessels in the brain and lead to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form with about 6million cases. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/embargoed-articles/?_articles=27d58547f7#"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, evaluated records from 1.2million veterans over 65 who sought care at a Veterans Affairs (VA) health system between 1999 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used VA data to compare dementia rates among veterans in 10 regions in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants were followed for 13 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 74, and 98 percent were men. About 86 percent were white. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of dementia diagnosis overall in the US is 83. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team divided participants by 10 geographic regions defined by the CDC: the Northeast, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Southeast, South, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, Southwest and Northwest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mid-Atlantic - which includes &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/delaware/index.html" id="mol-3f3777d1-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, Washington &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-3f3777d0-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-3f38b050-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey - was used as a baseline because it had the lowest dementia rate of 11 per 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 14 in every 1,000 participants in the Southeast had dementia, a 25 percent increased risk over the Mid-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Northwest - Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington state - and Rocky Mountain - Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming - both had dementia rates of 13 per 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This put those areas at a 23 percent increased risk over the Mid-Atlantic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada - the Southwest region - were at a 13 percent increased risk, with a rate of 12 per 1,000. The Midwest and Great Lakes regions were also around 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Northeast region had the smallest increase compared to the Mid-Atlantic with a dementia rate of 12 per 1,000 people and a seven percent greater risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers pointed to socioeconomic factors influencing regional risks, especially in southeastern states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christina Dintica, first study author and postdoctoral scholar of psychiatry at UCSF, said: 'Quality of education, early life conditions, and environmental exposures may be among those factors.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States like Kentucky and Mississippi also have high rates of conditions like diabetes, heart disease and obesity, all of which can damage blood vessels in the brain and trigger full-body inflammation that can kill brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also have high concentrations of industrial factories releasing chemicals like heavy metals and gases linked to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Military veterans in general are also at a higher risk of dementia overall due to higher rates of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can damage brain cells and blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some TBIs may also increase amounts of tau and amyloid proteins in the brain, which are known to cause Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also most common in veterans. The condition is thought to trigger inflammation in the brain and damage the brain's memory structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Veterans over 70, such as those in the study, were also more likely to have been exposed to Agent Orange, a mixture of herbicides used by the US military during the Vietnam War. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research suggests people exposed to Agent Orange were twice as likely to develop dementia as those who were not exposed due to inflammation and brain cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study had several limitations, including only focusing on veterans and the vast majority of participants being men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:28:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOTmdvWkZyd1ZNVllNaERCZVdKSmU1cVVVc0d5c21YekVwTzlVUmt0U3NsSmRmRF9TLVpVYXRIZm03dU9LVjZmbjRUcUd2c2V4TGdUTWFjME5qeVJjZ1NFWk9aWTZ6MmlBN2hWMkZsVG9PakR2T04yVGZFMzkxWmpMRUlSaUczb0FJUlNrazFoQjUwOTBPRWU3OVhyNG9talFCV0HSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZLVVJNZi1TaU1qb1EtNkZxOHRRN280cHhZZHdPX1ZjbnE3Y3RRSjFoLWd0dFhsWFRxbFh1LXRkbWkzWms4TTU5amxYZTM4Q05kNHFhRnF6amZPcjNVQ1NvNHY5SFBsMENYTTBydmUtaEVUakxESDU3Vnc0Z3JtQXBjZUg2SW5BNnc4NWxVYzdtWjBKSXlzYU9abk9NNjc2bzliQndvRkU</guid></item><item><title>敦促美国人对中国危险菌株引发的新型冠状病毒异常症状保持警惕--《每日邮报》 | Americans urged to stay vigilant for new unusual Covid symptom caused by dangerous Chinese strain - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZS1fbHJ6S05NeUgtSmN1SWR0Y0JqcjNwZDV1RWlpS3lSWlJrM2pSd3YweG1CYUpQaWZVZ3Q2UVBjQk0wZG0zWTl5MlI1MGItVi1RUW5DVE1GcGZFQ3ROUElGdEVXRnNuVUlqMXlFTl9sSHVmanRkM0JBUlFJSGY4cTRVYWc1cVVoYmtvaVFFcUNLR3lrWllzeU9NZGF0Z0VOclJGVHhyZ1RjUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOZVBLbGRRS2d3QzZmemNXQU5Bdi04dlRQaWg0MWhJSlNDTkVxN0Q2aERlMTM4U1R1cW9fTWE3UldiRWlWNjg3S3EweXJhWEswN1VXeHNmY1VaR2VpNzZ3Rk9XZjJiYTl6X1ozRG1ra1hzZ09SYnlIZ0hmY1JkMDZpMXQzRmNncmp2WkFyQ1dHUExaZGZBUEdzVEQ5M3hSVFpidjYxaU5vRHNDQklTQ20w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans are being urged to look out for a distinct symptom caused by a new Covid variant spreading in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple sources say that patients infected with the strain — dubbed NB.1.8.1 — are suffering from a painful sore throat that feels like a 'razor blade' or shattered glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Zhong Nanshan, a leading epidemiologist in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-d97732a0-453b-11f0-83c2-357a39ee5b81" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, told the country's state media that 'razor blade throat' was now more commonly being reported by patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many Chinese citizens are also posting online saying they have been afflicted by the symptom after catching Covid, warning it is painful and leaves them feeling 'completely drained'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in the West are now raising awareness about the symptom that is being linked to the variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NB.1.8.1 strain has sent cases surging in China, with the proportion of ER patients testing positive for the virus jumping over one month from 7.5 to 16.2 percent from March to May this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also taking hold in other neighboring countries including India and Thailand, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14773021/doctors-warn-new-covid-virus-china-outbreak.html"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; where the proportion of cases caused by the variant has risen from two percent to 19 percent since April.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a dozen cases have also been reported in Washington state, alongside infections in Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii. International travelers infected with the variant were reported arriving in Virginia and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People in China are reporting suffering from a painful sore throat after catching what they believe is the new Covid variant (stock image above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization says that early analysis suggests the variant is more infectious, and may now make up half of all cases globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they say there is no evidence that the strain is more likely to cause severe illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients infected with the variant are said to also be reporting other symptoms of a Covid infection similar to previous waves, including a cough, fever, muscle aches and congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nanshan told a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.dayoo.com/guangzhou/202505/20/139995_54827416.htm"&gt;state broadcaster&lt;/a&gt;: 'This round of Covid is not much different from the previous ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The early symptoms were similar, including fever, headache, general fatigue, and sore throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this time, clinical reports showed that the symptoms of razor blade throat were more obvious, and there were more coughs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And posts on the social media platform Weibo by Chinese citizens also reveal individuals are suffering from the symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'During lunchtime a few days ago, a colleague was coughing so wildly I thought she choked on food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She said it was a lingering effect from this Covid wave. When I asked about her main symptom, she said "razor blade throat".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second said: 'I've been hit with razor blade throat, and feel completely drained.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a third added: 'Post-Covid razor blade throat is brutal - swollen, painful, and I can barely speak. Any quick remedies?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The sore throat is described as leaving patients feeling like their throat contains shattered glass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The comments are being picked up by doctors in the UK, where the variant has also been detected, and also by the international organization World Health Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Switzerland-based group, which tracks Covid symptoms and variants, said in an alert: 'Commonly reported symptoms include a severe sore throat described as “razor-blade throat fatigue, mild cough, fever, muscle aches, and congestion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for the organization added to DailyMail.com: 'These consistent reports of unusually intense throat pain—distinct from earlier variants—are part of what led us to flag this symptom in our notice. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We continue to monitor both media coverage and direct input from WHN-affiliated clinicians and communities globally.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after some physicians in Ohio &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14753459/new-covid-strain-china-experts-face-masks.html"&gt;called for the return of mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; to emulate areas like Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amy Edwards, a pediatrician at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told CBS News last week that anyone who feels 'a little under the weather' should consider masking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another expert calling for masks is Dr Melanie Matheu, an immunologist from California who previously studied at the University of California, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US test positivity rate — proportion of swabs detecting the virus — rose slightly to 2.8 percent in the week to May 31, the latest available, compared to the previous seven-day spell where it was 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The proportion of ER patients infected with Covid remained at the same level of 0.3 percent of all those admitted over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Covid deaths still appear to be dropping. The latest figure, for the week to May 10, shows 250 deaths were recorded over that seven-day spell compared to 277 in the previous seven-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These levels are far below those in previous Covid periods, including the start of the 2021 wave where the US peaked at reporting 3,700 Covid deaths per day. The test positivity rate reached a high of 13.8 percent in early 2022 amid the start of the Omicron wave of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And are below those reported at the same time last year, when the test positivity rate was 3.5 percent and there were about 344 Covid deaths reported every week. About 0.4 percent of ER visits were also been linked to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:25:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZS1fbHJ6S05NeUgtSmN1SWR0Y0JqcjNwZDV1RWlpS3lSWlJrM2pSd3YweG1CYUpQaWZVZ3Q2UVBjQk0wZG0zWTl5MlI1MGItVi1RUW5DVE1GcGZFQ3ROUElGdEVXRnNuVUlqMXlFTl9sSHVmanRkM0JBUlFJSGY4cTRVYWc1cVVoYmtvaVFFcUNLR3lrWllzeU9NZGF0Z0VOclJGVHhyZ1RjUdIBrwFBVV95cUxOZVBLbGRRS2d3QzZmemNXQU5Bdi04dlRQaWg0MWhJSlNDTkVxN0Q2aERlMTM4U1R1cW9fTWE3UldiRWlWNjg3S3EweXJhWEswN1VXeHNmY1VaR2VpNzZ3Rk9XZjJiYTl6X1ozRG1ra1hzZ09SYnlIZ0hmY1JkMDZpMXQzRmNncmp2WkFyQ1dHUExaZGZBUEdzVEQ5M3hSVFpidjYxaU5vRHNDQklTQ20w</guid></item><item><title>苹果醋对健康有益吗？以下是营养学家的看法- marthastewart.com | Does Apple Cider Vinegar Have Health Benefits?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result, apple cider vinegar has earned a robust reputation as a popular health food, particularly for gut and digestive health. So much so that it can be found in products like canned or bottled drinks, powders, and gummy or capsule supplements. But on its own, does apple cider vinegar have any advantages for overall wellness, and is it just as good as other fermented foods? To find out, we asked registered dietitians to share insight on the trendy liquid, plus how it can realistically impact your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fermentation process required to make apple cider vinegar involves two steps, according to Elizabeth DeRobertis, MS, RD, CDN, CDE, CPT, registered dietitian and director of the nutrition program at Scarsdale Medical Group, White Plains Hospital. First, yeast turns the sugar in apple cider into alcohol, then bacteria turn that alcohol into acetic acid, the main component of vinegar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the second step, probiotics (i.e., "good" bacteria) begin to grow—but not all apple cider vinegars have these properties, she notes. "Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar has good bacteria, [but] filtered or pasteurized apple cider vinegar is heated, which kills off probiotics," says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before exploring the potential health benefits of apple cider vinegar, it's worth noting that it’s usually consumed in small amounts. That’s because it's commonly used as a flavoring ingredient, rather than a drink like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/benefits-of-kefir-11739412" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt;. (In fact, consuming too much apple cider vinegar at once can irritate the teeth, throat, and stomach, as it’s highly acidic.) With that in mind, apple cider vinegar isn't a magical solution, says DeRobertis. But it may have modest benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Cholesterol Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease, but some foods—including apple cider vinegar—could lend a hand. "Some small studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may modestly improve cholesterol levels," says Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN, LD/N, FADA, registered dietitian nutritionist, associate professor, and director of nutrition programs at University of South Florida. This includes lowering total cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol and raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. “These benefits are thought to be linked to acetic acid, the main active compound in vinegar, which may help reduce fat production in the liver,” per Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The catch? Most of these studies have been small or involved animals, so larger human trials are needed before ACV can be recommended as cholesterol-lowering treatment, says Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduces Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Apple cider vinegar contains antioxidants like polyphenols, particularly from the apples used in its production," says Wright. Polyphenols are plant compounds that combat oxidative stress (i.e., cell damage) in the body, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. And while apple cider vinegar isn’t a major source of these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-antioxidant-fruits-11736165" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;—especially when compared to fruits and vegetables—it might still provide a small boost, says Wright.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As apple cider vinegar ferments, it produces "the mother," a cloudy growth that contains probiotics, says Wright. "Probiotics support gut health by helping maintain a balanced microbiome, which is important for digestion, immune function, and mood regulation," she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, since apple cider vinegar is typically consumed in small amounts, it's not considered one of the top fermented foods for gut health, explains Wright. "Other fermented foods like yogurt with live cultures, kefir, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-eat-sauerkraut-11715256" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;, kimchi, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-miso-8769132" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt; contain a much higher and more diverse probiotic content," says Wright. They can also be enjoyed in larger portions, making them more effective in supporting a healthy gut microbiome, she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Control Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat carbohydrates (think bread, rice, pasta, or fruit) your body breaks down these foods into sugar, explains DeRobertis. The sugar enters your blood stream, prompting the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone that moves sugar out of the blood and into the cells for energy. For some people, particularly those who are insulin resistant, sugar may stay in the bloodstream longer, potentially causing high blood sugar, says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In these individuals, it's thought that apple cider vinegar may help reduce blood sugar by slowing down digestion or the breakdown of carbs. However, there's currently no solid evidence of this effect, so more research needs to be conducted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Fullness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The potential for apple cider vinegar to slow digestion may also help you feel fuller for longer, says DeRobertis. That's because slowing digestion also reduces how quickly sugar enters the blood, thereby stabilizing blood sugar and preventing energy crashes. Additionally, there's some evidence that acetic acid—which is found in vinegar, including apple cider vinegar—can stimulate a hormone that promotes fullness, but more studies are needed on this, says DeRobertis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-use-apple-cider-vinegar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As mentioned, apple cider vinegar is highly acidic, so it can "irritate the throat, erode tooth enamel, and upset the stomach if taken straight," says Wright. Thus, the vinegar should always be diluted in other ingredients or used in recipes for a tastier experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In water: &lt;/strong&gt;A common way to consume apple cider vinegar is to dilute one to two tablespoons in eight to 10 ounces of water, shares Wright. You can also try it in tea, seltzer, lemonade, or apple cider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire-cider tonic:&lt;/strong&gt; To give your apple cider vinegar a boost, infuse it with anti-inflammatory herbs, spices, honey, and vegetables. The resulting &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1513793/test-kitchens-favorite-fire-cider-tonic" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fire-cider tonic&lt;/a&gt; can be mixed in liquid, just like regular apple cider vinegar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salad dressings: &lt;/strong&gt;Whip up a &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/336993/basic-vinaigrette" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;basic vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt; with apple cider vinegar, then toss with greens or drizzle over roasted vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies: &lt;/strong&gt;If you enjoy the combination of tangy-sweet flavors, add a splash of apple cider vinegar to your next smoothie. Sweet ingredients like bananas, berries, honey, or dates can help balance the tanginess of the vinegar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marinades: &lt;/strong&gt;When used in marinades, acidic ingredients—including apple cider vinegar—can help soften meats. It can also be used in place of other acids (like lemon juice) in your favorite&lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/steak-marinade-recipes-7693356" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; marinade recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The healthcare system failed me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to improve his health and frustrated by how long it had taken to get a diagnosis, Marchione co-founded Superpower in 2022, a healthcare startup that analyzes 100 blood biomarkers, including cholesterol, heavy metals, the stress hormone cortisol and sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More testing done in 2024 using Superpower revealed even scarier health implications. Marchione had the toxins mercury and BPA in his body at levels higher than 99 percent of the US population. And doctors told him he had likely been unknowingly battling these toxins since he was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Max Marchione (pictured here), 25, spent a decade searching for answers behind his insomnia and migraines. He told Daily Mail it took a year to reverse all of his conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione, originally from Australia and now living in San Francisco, said: 'I tried to take things into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a big gap between the best care and what most people have access to. How do you close that gap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone needs access to the best care.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Marchione, Superpower suggested he take 400 milligrams of thiamine pills, also known as vitamin B1, an essential vitamin that turns carbs into energy and promotes healthy nerve function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body can't make vitamin B1 on its own, but it's found in pork, nuts, eggs, trout, black beans, whole grains, kale and cauliflower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low levels of thiamine can lead to severe nervous and cardiovascular system dysfunction, including confusion, memory problems, heart failure, brain swelling, nerve damage and balance issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American needs just one to 1.5 milligrams per day, but research suggests supplementing between 100 and 300 milligrams could help improve prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715873/"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found patients with prediabetes who took 300 milligrams of thiamine daily for six weeks had 11 percent lower glucose levels than those who didn't supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione claims taking 400 milligrams of thiamine every day reversed his prediabetes in three months. Dr Erika Schwartz, a preventative health expert and founder of Vault Science, told the Daily Mail: 'Taking 400 mg of vitamin B1 daily is considered a high dose, but it’s generally safe since any excess is flushed out in urine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplements have now allowed Marchione to occasionally enjoy carb-heavy foods like pasta or pizza without suffering glucose spikes, fatigue or digestive symptoms, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'When I had carbs, they didn't really affect me. But if I went off the vitamin B1, I'd have brain fog and bloating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Schwartz said: 'To truly move the needle, vitamin B1 needs to be paired with a healthy, whole-food diet, balanced hormones, and regular exercise. These lifestyle factors are the real drivers of insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thiamine can support the process — think of it like giving your body better tools to do its job — but it can’t replace the job itself. If you’re eating poorly, staying sedentary, and stressed out, no vitamin will fix that alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; BPA is relatively common in food packaging, cans, and plastic containers despite the well-established deleterious effects that has on the human body, such as infertility certain cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canned foods are responsible for 6.6 micrograms per person per day of BPA exposure. When when inside of the cans contain a BPA coating, the harmful chemical seeps into the food itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Superpower also told him to cut out canned foods from his diet, like soup, fish and vegetable oil, as well as some cheeses and sauces, to lower his levels of toxins and heavy metals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant cutting out canned sauces, soups and fish and trying to opt for more minimally processed, whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BPA, Bisphenol A, is an industrial chemical used in hard plastics and resins to make them more durable. It typically lines plastic and metal food containers and leeches into food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests BPA acts as an 'endocrine disruptor,' meaning it can imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of and response to natural hormones like estrogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to hormonal imbalances linked to early puberty, infertility and some reproductive cancers like ovarian cancer, as well as migraines like Marchione's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mercury is a heavy metal that gets deposited in the water and accumulates in fish like swordfish, king mackerel and albacore tuna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no 'safe' level of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Watchdog group Environmental Working Group estimates 16,000 foods in the US have BPA in their packaging, and nearly all fish and shellfish have traces of mercury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thiamine, also called vitamin B1, is thought to help lower blood glucose levels and stave off type 2 diabetes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marchione is pictured at left with the other co-founders of Superpower. The membership costs $499 and combines biomarker testing with AI-based solutions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, high mercury can lead to headaches and insomnia, similar to what Marchione experienced, due to it attacking the central nervous system and damaging brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione told the Daily Mail his lifestyle changes &lt;span&gt;reversed all of his symptoms within a year and slashed his biological age from 35 to 20 - five years younger than his chronological age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione estimates it took six months to a year to bring his levels back down to a normal range. Once they returned, his debilitating symptoms disappeared and he no longer was prediabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since reversing prediabetes, insomnia, migraines and high toxin levels, Marchione 'never gets sick.' He's now focusing on growing Superpower, which has 200,000 people on a waitlist, and making comprehensive biomarker testing more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Cancer at 50 starts when you're 20. Heart disease at 70 starts when you're 20. Dementia at 80 starts when you're 20. It makes sense to start testing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Testing should be a right and be as low cost as possible' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;By Y.M. Lowy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flooding is now New York City’s biggest public health threat, according to a new report from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every five years, the city reviews risks to public health, ranking hazards by how likely they are to cause serious problems. Flooding came out on top, ahead of infectious diseases, cyberattacks, coastal storms, and pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sea levels rising and storms growing stronger, flooding is expected to become more common and pose a bigger risk to New Yorkers in the years ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room doctor at Massachusetts General Brigham Hospital in Boston, who was the study’s lead author, said he was dismayed to find that most of the children’s deaths were homicides and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s surprising how few of these are accidents,” Dr. Faust said. “I always thought that a lot of pediatric mortality from guns is that somebody got into the wrong place, and I still think safe storage is important, but it’s mostly homicides and suicides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;John Commerford, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, called the study “political propaganda masquerading as scientific research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, examined the 13-year period after the June 2010 Supreme Court ruling that the Second Amendment, which protects an individual’s right to bear arms, applies to state and local gun-control laws.

the International Journal of Sexual Health in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Looking at its results, you should be looking to have &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; at least once a week, with there being a direct correlation with happiness, according to participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alexandra Janssen, a researcher at the University of Manchester, is the author behind the recent study and she pointed out the importance of regular sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The study found that women who were getting intimate more often, were happier (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It was found that 85 percent of women who had sex every week were 'sexually satisfied', said the survey, which accumulated the results from almost 500 heterosexual women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/weddings"&gt;wives&lt;/a&gt; and girlfriends who did the dirty just once a month, only 66 percent were as happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While it's not a huge drop-off, it's noticeable enough to take some notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If we go on to women who had sex less than once a month, the satisfaction level dropped to a dangerously low 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/35297660/women-sex-happiest-health/"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; The Sun, Janssen pointed out that those having intercourse less often than once a week were 'less likely to be satisfied in their sexual relationships'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Therapists working with women to improve their sexual relationship satisfaction might focus on increasing the frequency of sex," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Moving onto other findings, it was noted that women who ranked sex as 'very important' had better love lives than those that didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Janssen added that the low-rated importance of sex might be a 'coping strategy' from those who aren't doing the deed as often as they'd want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Getting intimate once a week should be the goal (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Women over the age of 45 were also the least likely to report happiness when it came to intimacy in their relationships, while satisfaction was higher with women who reported more regular orgasms and placed an importance on sex in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Coincidence? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;483 women from New Zealand were surveyed for the 2024 study, with all of them being in a committed relationship in the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;When it came to limitations, authors acknowledged that there was no way to verify if the answers were real, given that it was a survey. In addition, diversity wasn't a strong point of the study, limiting the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, it is said via YouGov that six in 10 Brits get between the sheets less than once a week, while just one in 10 say to have sex weekly, and just 15 percent say that they are intimate more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to all the scientific findings then, it seems that more is better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:58:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPQmMyWkxzaWkxUVFfSzdJd2FDU0tiUGozOU8tS0FndzdIXzNLc09wLW1XZ09Lcm0yYl9ZOHhFckFlU2F5cV9TQVFnQ1ZXa2dhc3N0XzJvT2NtVEp5V1cwZUlqa2xpYzBEb3F2WkFKQWlNeUFiUDhabURzbTlldnBKbTE2VVh1U3NpVjJNWFdDWHRJOFEwcTlCcW5ORi1UaXUzX1hpQmFtVGM5UzlxSlQw</guid></item><item><title>使用与新生血管性黄斑变性风险增加一倍相关的semaglutide - Medical Xpress | Use of semaglutide linked to doubled risk of neovascular macular degeneration - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOaFNpRmllZkN5QjMwZkk4UU5pUXJXSndEWmN6RE5CWjM4SGNMNUFHSGZsQS0xWDNkMzcxME1LeVpwRDNxMDBPM2o4UlR5TnJpWGhjRWlIOUFaWUUyUUR0aVRGNkZ3ZVpVOWg0Zkp6Nk1WWjQwMHNKdm4wdlkyNGZKTEZST1d4bU5EaGxualNsa0I4ZlBSTEM4YUh3aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, widely used to treat diabetes and obesity, was associated with more than double the risk of developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in older patients with diabetes, according to researchers at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration blinds more older adults in Western countries than any other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinal+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal disease&lt;/a&gt;. Neovascular AMD, while less common than its dry counterpart, causes nearly all cases of sudden, irreversible central vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth that damages the macula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), has transformed the treatment of type 2 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, obesity. Semaglutide, sold under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, now commands blockbuster status, often promoted as a solution for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and reduced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+risk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt;. Retinal effects were never in the intended target scope of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings first surfaced from major diabetes trials, where GLP-1 RAs were linked to complications in diabetic retinopathy. Reports of optic nerve damage followed. Small laboratory studies occasionally pointed in the opposite direction, suggesting neuroprotection or vascular benefits. Consensus remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has remained in the dust of accelerated prescriptions is a hazy picture of whether long-term GLP-1 treatments may be influencing retinal disease pathways like AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In the study, "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834964" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a population-based retrospective cohort analysis to determine whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; with diabetes face increased risk of nAMD after exposure to GLP-1 receptor agonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and demographic records across Ontario between 2020 and 2023 were used to identify 139,002 adults aged 66 and older with diabetes. Among them, 46,334 had used GLP-1 receptor agonists for at least six months, while 92,668 had no recorded exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical hazard modeling showed a significantly elevated risk of nAMD in the GLP-1 RA group. Adjusted hazard ratio was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.65–2.96), indicating more than double the risk compared to matched unexposed patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk rose with longer duration of GLP-1 RA use, reaching an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.62 for exposures of 30 months or more. Older age and prior cerebrovascular events were also independently associated with higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns over retinal complications from GLP-1 receptor agonists have sharpened as evidence accumulates. In two major cardiovascular trials—SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6—patients receiving &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/semaglutide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; showed higher rates of diabetic retinopathy complications than those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associations between GLP-1 RA exposure and nAMD diagnosis persisted across duration strata and mirrored earlier patterns of vision-threatening complications reported with semaglutide. The potential for delayed-onset ocular harm may warrant periodic eye examinations for patients receiving prolonged treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research will be needed to determine whether the retinal risks are a pharmacologic side effect, disease interactions, or artifacts of some other correlating data gap. In the meantime, a very large future cohort is being produced through the surge of semaglutide prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen time creates a vicious cycle—kids with emotional problems turn to devices for comfort, but screens can make those problems worse over time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gaming is the biggest concern, showing much stronger negative effects than watching TV or educational content, especially for older children aged 6-10.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The solution isn’t eliminating screens entirely, but being aware when devices become the automatic response to emotional distress instead of real-world coping strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYDNEY —&lt;/strong&gt; Your 8-year-old has a meltdown, so you hand them an iPad to calm down. It’s a move countless parents have made, but new research reveals this common solution might be creating a troubling problem that feeds on itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study led by scientists at Australian Catholic University tracking nearly 300,000 children over several years concludes that screen time doesn’t just cause emotional and behavioral problems in kids, it also becomes their go-to coping mechanism when they’re struggling. Screens both &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;create problems&lt;/a&gt; and become the solution kids reach for, forming what researchers call a “vicious cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000468.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, represents the largest analysis ever conducted on how screen use affects children’s emotional development over time. Rather than simply labeling screens as good or bad, it reveals something far more nuanced about how our digital world is reshaping childhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Screen use may increase the risk of children developing socioemotional problems, and children with socioemotional problems may be drawn to screens, possibly as a way &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/digital-pacifiers-children-emotional-anger-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to manage their distress&lt;/a&gt;,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaming-proves-most-problematic-for-kids"&gt;Gaming Proves Most Problematic for Kids&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Video games&lt;/a&gt; emerged as the biggest concern in the study. Children who played games were significantly more likely to develop emotional and behavioral issues later on. But here’s the troubling part: kids who already had these problems were even more drawn to gaming than other screen activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When children used screens for gaming, the effects were much stronger than when they used screens for general entertainment like watching TV. Gaming also showed the strongest tendency for troubled kids to seek out this particular screen activity when looking for relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents who carefully curate educational content for their toddlers while allowing unlimited gaming for their older children might want to reconsider their approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-older-children-face-higher-risks-than-expected"&gt;Older Children Face Higher Risks Than Expected&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, older children (ages 6-10) were actually more susceptible to screen-related problems than younger ones (ages 0-5). The reason appears to be autonomy: older children have more control over their screen choices and more opportunities to use devices as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/teen-screen-time-scrolling-mental-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional escape routes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 3-year-old might watch whatever parents put on, but a 7-year-old can actively seek out games or videos when feeling upset, angry, or anxious. Gender differences also emerged, with girls showing stronger negative reactions to general screen use, while boys in the older age group were more likely to develop problems from heavy gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-cost-of-screen-time"&gt;The Hidden Cost of Screen Time&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every hour a child spends gaming or watching videos is an hour not spent developing social skills with friends, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/chldren-screen-time-heart-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;being physically active&lt;/a&gt;, or learning to manage emotions through real-world experiences. Researchers call this the “displacement effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take a typical scenario: A 9-year-old feels frustrated about a bad day at school. Instead of talking to parents, going outside, or finding another healthy outlet, they retreat to their room with a tablet. The screen provides immediate relief, but the child never learns better coping strategies. Meanwhile, they miss out on the kind of parent-child interaction that actually builds emotional &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 117 separate studies spanning multiple countries and cultures, tracking children for periods ranging from six months to several years. They measured both screen use and various emotional and behavioral problems like aggression, anxiety, depression, and attention issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study design — following the same children over time rather than just taking snapshots — allowed researchers to see which comes first: the screen problems or the emotional problems. The effects, while statistically small, were consistent across studies. Screens aren’t single-handedly destroying childhood, but they’re contributing to problems in measurable ways that parents and policymakers should take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking this cycle starts with awareness. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parents who recognize&lt;/a&gt; that their emotionally struggling child might be self-medicating with screens can intervene more thoughtfully. This might mean addressing underlying anxiety or behavioral issues directly, rather than just limiting screen time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors note that some screen use, particularly educational content viewed with parents, shows little to no harmful effects. The problem isn’t screens themselves, but how they’re being used to fill emotional voids that might be better addressed through human connection and real-world experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For parents feeling overwhelmed by another study about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;screen time dangers&lt;/a&gt;, the message isn’t that you need to throw all devices out the window. Instead, it’s a call to be more aware of the patterns in your own home: when screens become the automatic solution to emotional distress, and what gets displaced in the process. Unlike many childhood challenges, this is one where parents still hold most of the control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 117 longitudinal studies that tracked children over time. The analysis included data from 292,739 children from various countries, with follow-up periods ranging from six months to several years. The team used advanced statistical modeling called “cross-lagged panel analysis” to determine whether screen use led to emotional problems, emotional problems led to more screen use, or both. Studies had to meet strict criteria: children had to be under 10.5 years old at the start, researchers had to measure both screen use and validated emotional/behavioral problems, and studies had to follow children for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research found small but significant bidirectional effects: screen use predicted later socioemotional problems, and children with socioemotional problems increased their screen use over time. Gaming showed much stronger effects in both directions compared to other screen activities. Older children (ages 6-10) were more susceptible than younger ones (ages 0-5), and effects were stronger when children exceeded recommended screen time limits. Children using screens above guideline recommendations showed meaningful associations with later problems, while those meeting guidelines showed minimal effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most studies relied on parent or self-reported screen time rather than objective measurements, which can be inaccurate. The research was predominantly conducted in Western countries with limited racial and ethnic diversity. Very few studies examined newer devices like smartphones and tablets specifically. The effects found were generally small, and the studies couldn’t control for all possible confounding factors like parenting style or family stress. Additionally, many individual studies had methodological limitations such as high dropout rates or lack of preregistration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors reported no specific funding for this work and declared no conflicts of interest. The research was conducted by an international team from universities in Australia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, the United States, and other countries. All data and analysis code are publicly available through the Open Science Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

Countless Reddit threads are filled with people asking the same thing: Does it matter how much protein I eat if I'm not trying to bulk up? The answer is yes. &lt;a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/cheap-and-healthy-sources-of-protein/" target="_self"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is not only necessary for gym buffs and bodybuilders -- it's essential for everyone. In addition to building muscle, protein helps with weight loss, energy levels, balancing hormones and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Your protein needs will vary based on factors like body weight and activity level. A general guideline from the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096" target="_self"&gt;recommended dietary allowance for protein&lt;/a&gt; is 0.36 grams per pound of body weight per day.

Here's what that would look like: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two eggs (12 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snack cheese (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt (15 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beef sausage (14 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One can of tuna (27 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup of rolled oats (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 ounces of deli ham (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 ounce of mixed nuts (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two slices of rye bread (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything pictured above comes to 103 grams, which puts you slightly over your daily target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What 100 grams of animal protein looks like for carnivores &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Amanda Capritto/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, getting 100 grams of protein from animal products doesn't take much: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four eggs (24 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One can of tuna (27 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three beef meatballs (15 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 ounces of turkey bacon (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of turkey breast (24 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This amounts to a perfect 100 grams of protein. If you ate all of this in a day, plus bread and other nonanimal products, you would surpass 100 grams of protein in a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What 100 grams of protein looks like for vegetarians &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Amanda Capritto/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For vegetarians, 100 grams of protein might look like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four eggs (24 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup of rolled oats (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two snack cheeses (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;¼ cup of protein granola (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single-serve Greek yogurt (15 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One tablespoon of hemp seeds (4 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two tablespoons of peanut butter (7 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One scoop of plant-based protein powder (20 grams) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes out to 99 grams of protein, which is pretty close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What 100 grams of protein looks like for vegans &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Amanda Capritto/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see isn't totally what you get with the amount of protein here: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 ounce of nuts (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup of rolled oats (5 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A protein granola bar (8 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two slices of rye bread (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;¼ cup of protein granola (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One tablespoon of hemp seeds (4 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two tablespoons of chia seeds (10 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two tablespoons of peanut butter (7 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One scoop of plant-based protein powder (20 grams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This amounts to 79 grams of protein. If we double up on the mixed nuts, chia seeds and hemp seeds, this brings us to 93 grams of protein. You could add an extra tablespoon of peanut butter or eat a full cup of oats, instead of half a cup, to come closer to 100 grams.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plate also excludes high-protein vegan meat substitutes, such as tofu, tempeh or plant-based meats like the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/impossible-burger-everything-you-need-to-know/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impossible Burger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

Ultimately, researchers predicted that those with HSV-1 and a specific gene, called the ApoE-e4 gene, had a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston, &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System; and &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Ruth Itzhaki, Ph.D., summarized her team’s findings in a recent article for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/thirty-years-on-our-research-linking-viral-infections-with-alzheimers-is-finally-getting-the-attention-it-deserves-254656" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and noted that, over the years, additional work has surfaced to support hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does it all mean, exactly? If a cold sore pops up, should you be concerned about dementia? We reached out to experts who explained everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HSV-1 is a common virus to which almost everyone is exposed early in life,” says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston. “It is best known for causing cold sores and is closely related to chicken pox and mononucleosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these viruses have in common is that they are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/neurotropism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurotropic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurotropic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they linger in the nervous system long after the initial illness, explains &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System, and can be reactivated by stress or lowered immunity. That’s how, for instance, chicken pox can manifest later in life as shingles, adds Dr. Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus’s ability to infiltrate the nerves is believed to get it past the blood-brain barrier, a membrane that shields the organ from infection via the bloodstream. Thanks to that entry point, Dr. Hunter says, HSV-1 is the most common cause of viral brain inflammation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no vaccine for HSV and almost everyone will get it by adulthood,” Dr. Hunter adds. Cold sores are a mild case of it, and symptoms can be treated with antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s may be connected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dormant HSV-1 may be reactivated by illness and reach the brain, explains &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada. This can trigger brain inflammation over time, known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:herpes encephalitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;herpes encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;and in people with genetic risk factors, like the ApoE-4 gene, contribute to Alzheimer’s development, he adds. “We don’t entirely know why ApoE-4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s,” adds Dr. Hunter. “The link to HSV could be that ApoE-4 impacts the blood-brain barrier and makes it easier for HSV to enter.” And the inflammation caused by that entry may heighten Alzheimer’s risk. “It is now universally accepted that inflammation in the brain is a key step in the development of Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Hunter reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What experts think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three decades since the original study, doctors and researchers have learned much more about Alzheimer’s disease and its connection to viral inflammation. For instance, several &lt;a href="https://www.uth.edu/news/story/several-vaccines-associated-with-reduced-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adults-65-and-older" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that being immunized for any disease (like COVID-19 or the flu) reduces Alzheimer’s risk, says Dr. Hunter. “Several other studies have shown that reducing inflammation in the brain helps prevent Alzheimer’s,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos concurs. “Since 1996, additional studies have found HSV-1 DNA in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s. Lab studies have also shown that HSV-1 infection can trigger the buildup of amyloid-beta and tau—proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer’s pathology,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few disclaimers to note. Firstly, the posed risk is associated with people who contract HSV-1 in early life, giving it time to progressively cause inflammation. The risk may be lower in adults, says Santos. “That said, if someone has other risk factors (like a weakened immune system or APOE-e4), adult-onset HSV-1 could still have long-term consequences,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, neurotropic viruses are extremely common, Dr. Yancey reiterates. “This makes it difficult to tease out whether they are causing neurologic problems or are simply common in the general population, including people with neurologic problems,” she adds. In other words, because most people end up with HSV-1 doesn’t necessarily mean that most people will get Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cold sores aren’t a cause for concern,” Santos adds. “They’re common and usually well-controlled by the immune system. But for people with frequent outbreaks, weakened immunity, or APOE-e4, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider. The concern is not a single cold sore, but long-term viral activity in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, including long-term studies, is needed to make any solid associations, Santos and Dr. Yancey conclude. “The current data is based on population-level surveys. There is no way to predict on an individual patient’s level whether this has a meaningful impact,” says Dr. Yancey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will, hopefully, at least help experts understand how antiviral treatment affects Alzheimer’s risk, as well as identify better ways to detect when HSV-1 is active in the brain. “The hope is that understanding how infections contribute to Alzheimer’s will open up new ways to prevent or treat it—especially before symptoms start,” says Santos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle choices that may help lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated, exercising, engaging in mental stimulation, and maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g33416014/heart-healthy-food-wd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; are all known ways to lower dementia risk, our experts say. Avoiding smoking or nicotine use of any kind can also “drastically” reduce the risk, says Dr. Yancey. All of these habits and choices work together to support both immune and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:18:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1LVjlfbG1Vbl8zeDlrZklBWjRvdkxLWGN1dmpzLUZVTE1vOXRNOGoyY1lPMTE4cGduTXNoU3JLenZ1SzhoNnBYVl9qMEVLZmU1MDhhdFU4SXhXenBpOWt5cGFxTGVMeWQ3amw3aW9VdVI5UkFxXzZBa0dtMmZqV1U</guid></item><item><title>在医生认为她的治疗“非紧急”之后， 29岁的女性接受了意想不到的、危及生命的诊断- aol.com | After Doctors Deemed Her Treatment 'Non-Urgent,' 29-Year-Old Woman Receives Unexpected, Life-Threatening Diagnosis - aol.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE9GbUFsQmo3SnVsdEZDQ2ZSY1dGaHViMVVMazJuUHpvMkFuYV8zWHdPM1lRaXpNb2ZCaTRWTlBIcVBRcjdvYXppNjRNMGdiNDRsTEpxVTd5dnNndXd6QlJfTmRJOTlMSGRNTVYyZDV3d28taUt3blE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a person holding their stomach&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Graham had only just turned 29 when she was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer, a disease that is becoming more prevalent among younger patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first thing I said to [my surgeon] was, 'Am I going to die?' to which he said, 'Look, I hope not,' " Graham recalled about learning of her diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After undergoing chemotherapy and having part of her colon removed, Graham is currently cancer-free, but she remains in a five-year period of surveillance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first question that Sarah Graham recalled asking her doctor after being diagnosed with stage 3 &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-27-tells-a-lie-to-get-colonoscopy-that-catches-stage-4-cancer-11712811" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bowel cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; days following her 29th birthday was, "Am I going to die?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her diagnosis came in 2024 after she went to the doctor to discuss a variety of symptoms, including an approximately 44-lb weight gain, extreme pain when going to the bathroom, and blood in her stool. That July, her general practitioner sent her for a stool test, which came back inconclusive, she told Australian news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/diagnosed-with-bowel-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mamamia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mamamia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colonoscopy was recommended, but Graham learned that it had been deemed "non-urgent," meaning that she was unable to schedule it until November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a patient receiving an ultrasound&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian interior designer's symptoms continued, and she told the outlet that she decided to get a second opinion. This led to her receiving a diagnosis that is becoming more prevalent among people her age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I explained my symptoms again to her, and said, 'Look, [the blood] is happening almost every time I go to the bathroom now. I'm getting really scared to go to the bathroom,' " she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham, who became lactose intolerant at 22 and was diagnosed and treated for endometriosis at 26, said that doctors initially thought that she had "something like Crohn's or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that they told her she was "way too young for bowel cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after undergoing a "traumatic" colonoscopy, Graham said that nurses seemed to be giving her a wide berth in the recovery room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was getting to 6 p.m. ... and I was the only one in the recovery room," she said, adding, "And, for some reason, none of the nurses were stopping to talk to me. They were all staring at a distance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mom was brought back, and the surgeon finally told her that they had found a mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham was told that she needed "to move quickly" to receive treatment and was scheduled for an "urgent CT scan," with the doctor saying that the mass was "likely malignant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After undergoing additional testing, she was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I knew something was wrong [but] I never expected this. I felt let down, I think," she admitted. "I know my body, and I knew what I was living with and no one would listen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the original doctor, who believed she might be suffering from hemorrhoids or a fissure, Graham wondered "what would've happened" had she waited until November to undergo her colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham had part of her colon removed and went through six months of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After treatment, she said that she is undergoing surveillance for five years. However, her outlook is "good" at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a person holding a model of intestines&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've put me in a low risk of recurrence category but, of course, there is no life free of the burden of cancer, unfortunately," she explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the designer is sharing a lesson that she hopes others will learn from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best piece of advice I was given is that if your doctor says no to something you request, ask them to write that down. You will quickly realize that if they don't want to put their name to denying you something, and something happens later, they don't want to be liable for it," she said, adding, "If anything is out of the ordinary, you need to get it checked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21871" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; noted that people under the age of 50 are increasingly being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The diagnosis is also slightly more deadly than it was in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the diagnosis becoming more prevalent is unclear.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The ingredient tirzepatide, available as Mounjaro, has been hailed the 'King Kong' of slimming jabs and a breakthrough in the war on obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charlotte Lloyd, 37, a social media manager from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-4f432cb0-4509-11f0-b2f7-3541868aa3e5" class=""&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and member of the online group, had anxiety symptoms so bad she found herself in A&amp;amp;E, The &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/after-taking-weight-loss-drugs-my-life-fell-apart-g76cd9bkc"&gt;Times&lt;/a&gt;

I may as well have been eating sweets. After two nights awake I started to feel like I was losing my mind,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is estimated a 1.5 million people in the UK used weight-loss jabs, which have been hailed the solution to the obesity epidemic, in March 2025 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't just difficulty sleeping, three days after she started experiencing symptoms, she went to A&amp;amp;E when her 'heart was pounding nonstop'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the hospital an ECG revealed her heart was above the normal resting heart rate for adults, which is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while it was 105bpm compared to her normal resting heart rate of 70bpm, the rhythm wasn't irregular, so she was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I explained I hadn't slept in days and they basically told me to go home and have a bath,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite still struggling to sleep, her GP was unable to help, as she had 'reached the limit of what she could prescribe'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Things got worse when she was hit by a series of panic attacks and tremors for five weeks—which she likened to 'swallowing an earthquake'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she had noted in her application for the medication she had experienced some anxiety and insomnia in the past, it was still approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the anxiety she now experienced she described as 'a physical terror I've never known. Like a switch had been flipped in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Things got worse when she was hit by a series of panic attacks and tremors for five weeks—which she likened to 'swallowing an earthquake'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went into a constant state of fight-or-flight—like a bad drug trip that wouldn't end. I couldn't see how I was going to be able to survive it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially signed off work unable to 'do anything' or even 'follow a conversation', she later resigned with her relationship ending that same week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman who said her life 'just fell apart', said: 'The way I see it, it's a roll of the dice as to how you're going to react to these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If people knew that they could have potentially catastrophic mental and physical side-effects, they could make a more informed decision about taking them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Lloyd isn't the only one experiencing psychological side effects—another woman also found herself in A&amp;amp;E after taking the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Edwards, ended up in hospital last year only 48 hours after taking her first dose of the Mounjaro jab.&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/after-taking-weight-loss-drugs-my-life-fell-apart-g76cd9bkc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When her BMI was over 30, so she too qualified for the weight loss jab which got from the online doctor, MedExpress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought I was having a heart attack,' she said, but her scans, x-trays and bloods taken, all came back clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had any mental health problems. I've never had a panic attack or anxiety. I've always been a laid-back person and now it's like everything is stressful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get this thing that we've termed 'air hunger' where it's like I can't take a deep breath. If I'd have known Mounjaro could have mental health side-effects I never would have taken it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third woman, Julie Peters, a 31 year-old mother from Birmingham had a similar experience after getting the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a panic attack that lasted two hours on January 11, after taking the lowest dose, 2.5mg, of Mounjaro, once a week for two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother went to A&amp;amp;E also thinking she was having a heart attack, but similarly she said: 'tests on my heart, kidneys, and for pancreatitis all came back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Peters also described experiencing tremors, a 'tugging' sensation in her brain' and tinnitus—'The ringing in my ears has been constant, sometimes with multiple ringing sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pressure and heaviness in my brain make me feel dull, disconnected and nauseous, and I also have a sensitivity to motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recently requested a brain MRI, and while the results came back normal, I am relieved yet uncertain about what to do next. It's incredibly suffocating,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10960895/"&gt;a study published&lt;/a&gt; in January last year in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy which found 481 psychiatric events were linked to weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'seriousness of the adverse events warrants additional research' to explore the causual relationship,' said lead authors, Hajer Elkout and Mansour Tobaiqy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was despite psychiatric events only accounting for 1.2 per cent of total reports associated with the active ingredients in weight loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anxiety, depression nor insomnia were listed as potential side effects by Asda Online Doctor by Zava or in the patient leaflet they refer patients to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinical governance team at the private pharmacist who stressed patient safety told The Times all applicants are required to give their medical history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes their GP details which they said enables the GP to inform them 'of any discrepancies or concerns they have with the prescription'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added there are studies evidencing mental health can be improved with treatment, and no clinical-based-evidence of a negative impact 'they are aware of'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;a study published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal of Natural Medicine found taking semaglutide for weight loss or diabetes reduced the incidence of suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14643325/harmful-effects-Ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html"&gt;more recent study&lt;/a&gt; found Ozempic and Mounjaro can raise the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Asda Online Doctor by Zava added: 'Our doctors, of course, will provide suitable advice to any particular patients of concern or who are managing complex mental health issues and may not be able to use the treatment appropriately alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patients, where necessary, will be signposted to their GPs for further support to manage their weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The manufacturers of Mounjaro, Eli Lilly, and of both Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk told The Times patient safety was their top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take any reports about patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines,' said Eli Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With Novo Nordisk adding it welcomes: 'Independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two drug companies both highlighted that the UK regulatory agency had assessed the risk and benefits approving their respective drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Novo Nordisk added that independent analysis 'did not find an association between use of GLP-1RA medicines and the occurrence of increased risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Key actions include training, mapping high risk and vulnerable populations for tailored interventions, data driven approaches for social listening, community feedback and dialogue, and managing misinformation. This entails, inter alia, communicating effectively the uncertainties and new information regarding the natural history of mpox and modes of transmission, the effectiveness of mpox vaccines and duration of protection following vaccination, and about any clinical trials to which the local population may have access, as appropriate. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address stigma and discrimination of any kind via meaningful community engagement, particularly in health services and during risk communication activities, and through engagement with civil society groups, such as HIV networks.

Anxious attachment, marked by insecurity and low self-esteem in relationships, was associated with worse sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the link between poor sleep and jealousy only held true for individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety. These findings suggest that a person’s attachment style may influence how sleep impacts emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attachment and Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxious attachment correlates with poorer sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Jealousy:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep increases daily jealousy only in those with attachment anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Interventions:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding attachment style can help tailor sleep and relationship interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;AASM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that poor sleep quality is related to relationship insecurity, which moderates the effect of sleep quality on daily feelings of jealousy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that anxious attachment, which involves difficulties with trust and low self-esteem in relationships, was related to poorer sleep quality. The study also found that poor sleep quality was associated with more daily feelings of jealousy, but this effect was only significant for those with high levels of attachment anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, poor sleep wasn’t uniformly related to all negative socioemotional outcomes,” said Giovanni Alvarado, lead author and doctoral candidate at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that attachment style might shape which emotions are most affected by sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, sleep is essential to health. The AASM recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health. In addition to adequate duration, healthy sleep requires good quality, appropriate timing and regularity, and the absence of sleep disturbances or disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 68 young adults who completed questionnaires about sleep and relationships. They also completed daily self-reports capturing experiences of social emotions and behaviors over a two-week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Alvarado, the study underscores the complex link between sleep and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with anxious attachment, or those who struggle with insecurity in relationships, may be especially vulnerable to feelings of envy and jealousy when they’re sleep deprived,” said Alvarado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This helps us understand why some individuals may have more difficulty navigating social situations when they’re tired and could inform more targeted interventions that consider an individual’s relationship style when addressing sleep issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and jealousy research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Miller – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at SLEEP 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:55:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5XaEVZbUpYLURwWWJJeUNvckp5bzR5V1F3UkR0ZHEwYjhuM0pSd1ZqUzliamZqRDEwa3JncDV3Mzh1QUZUeTRwLTlwdkZfekY2ZUpIdmhQYTc1eEV1dmtQRHd0VmE0RmRfQmpaOXB3</guid></item><item><title>以色列科学家发现“既对抗又助长”乳腺癌的免疫细胞-以色列时报 | Israeli scientists discover immune cells that ‘both fight and fuel’ breast cancer - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:52:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNSkhURWFFckM0aWY1b0NROU1oaWQzQUYxa2JqTmN0LXRkZm5NaURDTEFLdE81MktvQ254elNKalNQRHY2bFQ2RzI2UFU2NUtOTC1UMjdSa0RIQnlHR05hQ0tYb0VCNmpsc0ROWDFsN1Z4NDB1OGFzXzd4aVN3LXVzN1huNmZwN0dSTEVZYjJLR3diMUFwUkxOUV9XR2t2dHpTNFgzallaUHR0Um16bUpn0gG0AUFVX3lxTE9nUHZMaVRwSVNiTUVVc1JLVnBWelRldV95WEN6X19PTkUwaHVVYzRXLW5JVUhQbHhtNU1URFVwRUVJZVpsYzN5VTU0ZzVmVnlJRkFJSW9uM2lQTy1qUWltRkc5bjl4TDhqdHRsdkRLUE5aWXZ3Z2RLTmw4UXNrRXJXUk9GV1FuaW5YZW4xYl9jamFMUVBFUHg4dTlMSVhrMU1JSDlsXzdySkFEekVKb29ldkxBTg</guid></item><item><title>为什么有些人在噪音中比其他人听得更好-神经科学新闻 | Why Some People Hear Better in Noise Than Others - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1WVTVfTVNKU0U3ck9IRUF4Q0V2LXBsblAxUVpYM2tXUlduWElsYkU4cV9vWVcwVThZbkVxSHpkQWFXY3hIRlNSMVJLTnRINnd6NFh4QmhnQVplNFZWMFpPaWczTmc0SXhtejk3TGVkYmZxd1Jy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large-scale international study has confirmed that the ability to detect background sounds varies significantly from person to person and depends on the preceding noise. By replicating a 10-year-old study with 149 participants across 25 labs in 10 countries, researchers found consistent results supporting the original findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People’s sensitivity to detecting a signal amid noise is not only variable but influenced by what sounds they heard just before.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago, a research paper suggested that some people are better at picking out background sounds than others, and that this ability depends on the surrounding noise. But the study’s findings were based on data from just five participants, each completing a five-hour task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peelle, a professor of communication sciences and disorders at Northeastern, wanted to see if he could expand this study and understand how listeners understand speech in noise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a fundamental part of hearing and how we perceive the world,” said Peelle, who studies how people understand speech in noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that people’s perception is affected by that was really intriguing and tied into a whole bunch of other ideas about how we hear and understand speech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers had the same reaction as Peelle when this study came out and wanted to try to expand on it. But he found people who tried to replicate the original study had struggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing a replication would need to involve other labs given the scale, he and his team opened up the project to other research teams around the world. They also worked through the original paper and spoke with the team behind it to make sure they had all the details needed to replicate the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got their sounds and their code to really understand what they did and if we were doing anything differently,” Peelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we were convinced it was working, we put out a call for other labs to participate and … we were able to do a much more comprehensive job. In the end, we figured out some reasons why we weren’t able to replicate their study, and the main findings did stand up. But we had to jump over a lot of hurdles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had participants complete a series of tests over the course of five sessions that involved listening to a sequence of noises that would get louder or softer, Peelle said. The noise would then hit a steady volume and a beep would come in. Participants would have to indicate when they heard the beep, which appeared half the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to determine at what point people can start distinguishing certain sounds and make sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original study authors did share their code and data, so the study could be as closely replicated as possible, down to what buttons people had to press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to think about this is if you’re in a noisy coffee shop and you’re having trouble hearing a person you’re having a conversation with, it’s easier for some of their words to break through to your consciousness than others,” Peelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a really simplified version of that task. We’re just asking, did you detect a beep and noise? If we can better understand  how our brains are understanding this really simple thing, it may then tell us more about how we have conversations in a coffee shop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expanded study confirmed the results of the original: people’s ability to perceive sounds does change depending on what they just heard. The study also showed that different people have different levels of ability when it comes to gauging this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people are much more sensitive to this effect than others, which is potentially useful if we want to use this as a clinical diagnostic tool,” he said. “We know that there’s variability and effect. There are some people who don’t really seem to (show) this effect very much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on a larger scale, the study also showed the value of collaboration, Peelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The exciting part to me was the collaborative nature of science (and) how enthusiastic people were to help out with this,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to get 25 teams from 10 countries to help out and pull together this kind of big group effort.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much of Canada is ablaze again, with more than 200 active wildfires having consumed roughly 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers) since January, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ciffc.net/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Thursday, June 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This escalating situation pumped massive amounts of smoke across the Canada-U.S. border, affecting air quality as far south as Florida, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/noaa-satellites-monitor-canadian-wildfires-and-smoke"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (NOAA). As climate change &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lengthens and intensifies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; wildfire season in many regions across the world, understanding the dangers of smoke exposure is increasingly important. A wave of new research paints a complex picture of how wildfire smoke impacts the body, linking it to startling health outcomes that go far beyond the respiratory system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is an urgent need for research to fully understand the health impacts of wildfire smoke to raise awareness among public and health professionals, as well as to support the development of effective regulations to mitigate the impacts,” Yaguang Wei, assistant professor of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, recently told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/06/wildfire-smoke-can-harm-heart-and-lungs-even-after-the-fire-has-ended/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harvard Gazette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wei is the lead author of a new study, published in May in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/9900/medium_term_exposure_to_wildfire_smoke_pm2_5_and.374.aspx"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that wildfire smoke can damage the lungs and heart for up to three months after the fire is out. He and his colleagues linked this “medium-term” exposure to increased risks of various cardiorespiratory conditions, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, and asthma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even brief exposures from smaller fires that last only a few days can lead to long-lasting health effects,” Wei told the Harvard Gazette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Infectious fumes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wildfire smoke is a mixture of gases, air pollutants, water vapor, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/why-wildfire-smoke-health-concern"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (EPA). It contains significant levels of toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), some of which are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality"&gt;&lt;span&gt;known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/risk/other-carcinogenic-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons#:~:text=List%20of%20carcinogenic%20polycyclic%20aromatic,other%20than%20benzo%5Ba%5Dpyrene"&gt;&lt;span&gt;carcinogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Recent studies even suggest that wildfire smoke carries microbial and fungal pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One such study, published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-020-00788-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ISME Journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2021, noted that 80% of microbes found in wildfire smoke samples were still viable. While it’s still unclear how these organisms survive the extremely high temperatures in wildfires, researchers do have an idea of how they get into the smoke in the first place. George Thompson, a professor of medicine at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study, told Gizmodo that wildfires pull pathogens from the surrounding soil and vegetation as they draw in air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00046-3/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lancet, Planetary Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associated California wildfires with an 18% to 22% increase in invasive fungal infections such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;valley fever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Thompson pointed out that the study was based on large hospital data, which is “a great start,” but further research will need to corroborate this link. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain on fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most hazardous component of wildfire smoke is not pathogens, but PM2.5. These minuscule particles penetrate deep inside the lungs and wreak havoc on the respiratory system. Previous research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456361/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;shown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the tiniest, ultrafine particles can pass from the lungs directly into the bloodstream. This can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/40/20/1590/5372326"&gt;&lt;span&gt;damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; blood vessels and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250783/#:~:text=Translocated%20particles%20as%20well%20as,%2C%20and%20chronic%20heart%20failure)."&gt;&lt;span&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; harmful inflammation and oxidative stress in various organs, including the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiple studies have associated wildfire smoke exposure with incidence of dementia. Last year, research published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2827124"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1.2 million Southern Californians aged 60 and older, and found a significant link between long-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and a heightened risk of dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, every 1 microgram per cubic meter increase in the three-year average of wildfire PM2.5 raised the odds of a dementia diagnosis by 18%. In comparison, the same increase in PM2.5 from non-wildfire sources was linked to only a 1% greater risk of developing dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was expecting for us to see an association between wildfire smoke exposure and dementia,” lead author Holly Elser, an epidemiologist and resident physician in neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-07-29/study-wildfire-smoke-raises-dementia-risk-more-than-other-pollutants"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Los Angeles Times in 2024. “But the fact we see so much stronger of an association for wildfire as compared to non-wildfire smoke exposure was kind of surprising.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Psychological fallout &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other studies have linked wildfire smoke to adverse psychological outcomes. Research published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832210"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in April analyzed data on wildfire PM2.5 levels and mental health-related emergency department visits throughout California between July and December 2022—the state’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020#:~:text=911%20Translate%20Settings-,2020,Search:"&gt;&lt;span&gt;worst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; wildfire season on record. The study found that wildfire smoke correlated with a significant spike in mental health emergency department visits for up to seven days post-exposure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our study suggests that—in addition to the trauma a wildfire can induce—smoke itself may play a direct role in worsening mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and mood disorders,” co-author Kari Nadeau, a physician-scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a university &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-linked-with-worsening-mental-health-conditions/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Questions remain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of this research demonstrates that wildfire smoke is more than just a respiratory hazard. But experts are still in the early stages of unraveling its complex health impacts—particularly in terms of mental health, Angela Yao, a senior scientist with the Environmental Health Services at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Canada, told Gizmodo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many questions remain unanswered, she said. For example, “How do you disentangle the impact of smoke from the impact of the fire itself?” Future studies will need to investigate these confounding factors. But, “even with the current evidence that we have—it already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gives us confidence that we should take a lot of action,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To protect yourself from the hazards of wildfire smoke, Yao recommended limiting the length and intensity of time spent outdoors. “The harder you breathe, the more smoke you inhale,” she said. If you must go outside, wearing an N95 mask or a P100 can reduce your smoke exposure, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/documents/respiratory_protection-no-niosh-5081.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;EPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keep windows and doors shut to ensure that your indoor air is safe. It’s also important to make sure your home’s HVAC system is running properly, Yao added. If you don’t have one, you can purchase a portable air filter or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; your own using a furnace filter and a box fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As wildfire season becomes increasingly impactful, taking steps to protect yourself and your family from smoke has never been more critical. Experts still have a long way to go towards fully understanding the risks of wildfire exposure, but one thing is clear—these hazards aren’t going away any time soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists have uncovered a surprising fungus that incorporates gold into its structure in soils where trace particles of this metal occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery raises eyebrows because gold rarely reacts with living organisms. It caught everyone’s attention when researchers noticed bits of gold attached to the microscopic strands of the fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/fungi-hidden-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mycelium&lt;/a&gt; are the fine, thread-like filaments that help fungi absorb nutrients. In the case of this fungus, they seem capable of interacting with gold through metabolism in ways many believed to be nearly impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gold is so chemically inactive that this type of interaction is unusual and surprising,” remarked &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=7_x-MfQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Tsing Bohu&lt;/a&gt;, the lead researcher at &lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2019/may/gold-coated-fungi-are-the-new-gold-diggers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discovering-gold-eating-fungus"&gt;Discovering gold-eating fungus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bohu and his colleagues at CSIRO, first observed that the fungus grows faster and appears healthier when gold attaches to its cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts think these findings could help geologists detect underground gold deposits through more targeted surveys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration companies have historically analyzed plants, soils, and even water to locate gold-rich areas, but the use of gold-seeking fungi opens the door for a more focused approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have been obsessed with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/couple-finds-a-gold-nugget-measuring-7-inches-across-weighing-more-than-9-pounds/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for centuries because of its scarcity and status in global markets. It is essential in medical devices, smartphones, and numerous other technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/supergiant-gold-deposit-find-claims-to-be-the-worlds-largest-discovery-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effort to mine gold&lt;/a&gt; comes with challenges, including large excavation sites and water-intensive processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new fungal method could reduce environmental pressures because it taps into the natural processes of living organisms rather than relying on large-scale digging or harsh chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-gold-fungus-stands-out"&gt;Why this “gold fungus” stands out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus studied by the Australian team belongs to strains similar to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fusarium-oxysporum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been reported to transform inorganic particles through metabolic pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pathways allow gold to accumulate in or on the fungal filaments over time. The fungus in question draws energy from its surroundings in ways that encourage gold accumulation, though researchers are still pinpointing the precise enzymes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intriguing strain called &lt;a href="https://www.mycobank.org/details/708/105304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida rugopelliculosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been noted for producing gold nanoparticles through a stress response when exposed to certain gold compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest that these microorganisms release specific &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24456802/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polysaccharides&lt;/a&gt; and proteins to reduce the metal ions and keep the resulting gold in stable nanoparticle form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological trick could be a big win for miners looking for less destructive ways to harvest precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-eyes-toward-the-stars"&gt;Turning eyes toward the stars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space agencies and private companies are already exploring methods to mine resources on asteroids, whose metal content is often richer than that of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earths-first-crust-already-had-chemical-traits-of-modern-continents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Earth’s crust&lt;/a&gt;. The fungus’s ability to process gold in harsh conditions shows potential for extraterrestrial applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers envision deploying specialized microbial colonies to break down metals in orbiting rocks, transforming space mining into a more efficient, lighter operation without the need for massive excavators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers debate how well a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; would perform in low-gravity environments with limited nutrients. Yet the concept of sending living systems into space to work on raw materials intrigues those who want to lower mission costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the fungus can multiply and process metals using minimal equipment, it might shift how organizations plan resource extraction far from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fresh-angle-on-sustainability"&gt;Fresh angle on sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are tightening environmental rules on mining because of landscape damage and water pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods to extract gold frequently involve toxic substances or large energy inputs. The new fungus-based approach presents an idea that goes hand-in-hand with more eco-conscious strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also potentially safer for workers, who could see a reduced need for heavy machinery. More importantly, harnessing a living organism’s capabilities means that gold may be collected in forms that are easier to refine with fewer harsh processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these notions remain in the early stages, they shine a light on how biology can inform industrial practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-future-plans"&gt;Challenges and future plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists must still figure out how to cultivate this organism on a grand scale. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/family-photographs-a-rare-red-cane-fungus-thought-to-be-extinct-stinkhorn-mushroom/"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; may need very particular conditions to produce gold particles efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moisture, soil pH, and other minerals might influence how well it grows and how much gold it accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring no harmful mutations take place during large-scale fungal cultivation is also a concern. The introduction of any non-native organism to new environments warrants caution, especially if plans involve use in space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration among biologists, engineers, and mining experts could clarify best practices so that the fungus remains beneficial without unexpected ecological impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prospects-for-the-mining-industry"&gt;Prospects for the mining industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mining firms are already discussing the potential for gold-focused fungal detection kits. These kits could analyze samples in less time than typical drilling and surveying routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the fungus picks up subtle traces of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-gold-rush-begins-as-very-high-volume-deposit-identified-in-a-single-drill-hole/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, exploration teams would zero in on precise areas with a higher likelihood of viable deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same methods could apply to other metals that share certain chemical traits with gold. Meanwhile, ongoing research is exploring variations of the fungus that absorb different elements to aid geologists in pinpointing new sources of valuable minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10966691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heliyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:24:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxORk10TEs1NEY4LTVXMjd5VGFfaEtaZU9GdFdxSV96ajdjVzVCaEhzYUg1Y0dwQXk1ZVFSaHZ2ei1OWkxBZU9RY3VvVU5sX2dyM3lGb1BvQ05mT216a051TnRxRTk2U25wMTRnUXJmMFZhQkRRUmxaWEtWSC1YV3R6UGxYSkRWdmNnZGo2eWVQdldmV20zOVlHekNIZERRdW9adlA4dnJ5dmR2aGczbk94al9IN3BqOUxtMmFSa3ljWkRsZmF6SEdnUmc2Q0pkT0YwUVM5UE5uMjFfOEI3Rnk4WUZB</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的“Ozempic手”的崛起，让名人看起来“不死” -每日邮报 | Shocking rise of 'Ozempic HANDS' that leaves celebs looking 'undead' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMW85NURTb3B2bXdTZ0RFenpDZkp4UE9tSjZ1R2NxSWFoYzkyRFpxUEVabXJXNzNRMVVpZWtLQ1RKYnRaZVk1Q3JNOUZpRXdZUF84OThUcGtZUDhUWWFhNDFuUng5d3ZDeVVDTm5hVDdyOXVkaG9LYzV1NjFENEE0VDFqWUxNLTU4b0J5VkRBRU5EdGpUcjhiTlFzQldVNlYtbEd0cGpsYW1FekZ0SnM3YlA5X2tPRnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have raised the alarm over a bizarre new side effect &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14550239/Ozempic-arms-legs-bums-look-like-MELTED-CANDLES-terrifying-new-effect-rapidly-emerging-weight-loss-drugs-young-people.html"&gt;linked to weight-loss jabs - dubbed 'Ozempic hands&lt;/a&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term refers to the thinning, almost skeletal appearance of the hands and fingers reported in some people on drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the treatment triggers rapid fat and muscle loss across the body, subcutaneous fat is also stripped from the hands - leaving bones, veins and tendons more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The phenomenon was recognised when the jabs first began to be widely used, and some patients reported needing to have wedding and engagement rings resized as their fingers slimmed down, along with their waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the trend is back in the spotlight after viral social media videos highlighted how the hands of certain celebrities appear to have changed dramatically over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have prompted a wave of online speculation about whether it might be an effect of weight-loss injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One clip, which has been viewed over three million times, focused on &lt;a target="_self" href="/tv/reality-tv/index.html" id="mol-8f6e9960-408a-11f0-baf7-5b08ba8bab7a"&gt;reality TV&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/khloe_kardashian/index.html" id="mol-8f6e9961-408a-11f0-baf7-5b08ba8bab7a" class=""&gt;Khloe Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;, comparing images of her hands recently and a decade before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the creator of the video didn't speculate as to the cause, social media users were quick to suggest it was due to blockbuster weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Khloe Kardashian hasn't said she has used a weight-loss jab but previously did say she would have tried them when she was attempting to lose weight in her younger years. Khloe pictured here in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Clips on social media have compared Khloe's hands to images taken of the reality TV star in 2012, like this one.

My hands did that too,' commented one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts speaking to MailOnline explain that fat loss to the hands can &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/us-health-weekend-features-project/article-11710299/Wegovy-prompts-muscle-loss-patients-doctors-say.html"&gt;happen with any version of the drug, including Wegovy and Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pharmacist and nutritional therapist Deborah Grayson, known as The Godmother of Pharmacology on &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tgopharm"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, said: '&lt;span&gt;Ozempic hands is the visible thinning of fingers that can occur during rapid weight loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'As with weight loss in general, fat loss doesn't happen evenly across the body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The hands, which naturally have very little fat to begin with, can appear bonier or slimmer as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It's not a side effect of the medication itself, but rather a visual consequence of rapid fat loss.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added that it wasn't harmful, however the change would be permanent - unless the patient regained weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cosmetic treatments such as injections of fillers to 'plump' and rejuvenate the hands may be one remedy, however these are specialist procedures and cost many hundreds of pounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics told MailOnline that 'Ozempic hands' or alternatively 'Ozempic fingers' are a real phenomenon that can occur among people taking weight-loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro. Oprah Winfrey, who has confirmed she has taken weight-loss jabs, is pictured with noticeably thinner fingers in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured here are Oprah's hands in 2015, looking noticeably fuller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GP Dr Donald Grant, a senior clinical advisor at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theindependentpharmacy.co.uk/"&gt;The Independent Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;, also said Ozempic hands or fingers was nothing to medically be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he added that patients on the drugs should still keep an eye on potential side effects and seek advice from their GP if needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'S&lt;span&gt;hould people experience increased side effect intensity or different reactions to the treatment, people should visit their GP, who can provide further advice,' he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Anyone concerned about the amount of weight they're losing should also seek urgent medical attention.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the TikTok clip that sparked the new discussion of the side effect, &lt;span&gt;a woman posting under the name 'atruthforyou' compared images of Khloe Kardashian's hands from 2012 to a picture taken in 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the latter, the star's fingers are noticeably thinner and appear longer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are her hands today, like how, what is going on here?' she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a follow up video on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKKbwcmN88D/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; she continued: 'You're telling me this hand transformation is just from weight loss?

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Ozempic hands' is just the latest in a series of side effects people have speculated A-listers may be suffering from after taking weight-loss jabs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In extreme and rapid cases of weight loss - such as that which occurs in people using weight-loss jabs - surgery can be the only remedy for this excess skin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it's not just a cosmetic issue; patients with excess skin can also suffer mobility problems and infections due to excess skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if they choose to fix the issue with surgery, they also face the inescapable risk of surgical complications including blood clots. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue of the aesthetic aftermath of weight-loss jabs is only going to grow larger as the drugs are dished out to more and more people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 4,000 patients a month are prescribed GLP-1 drugs on the NHS in the UK, with almost 350,000 patients receiving the medications in 2024, though additionally 500,000 are thought to be taking the drugs privately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And more could be on the way - as British GPs will be able to prescribe the jabs directly to patients from this month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a shake-up from the previous system which required patients to attend a specialist NHS weight-loss clinic to get the jabs on the health service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this will initially only be available for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14767431/weight-loss-jabs-NHS-ETHAN-ENNALS-drugs-FREE-GP.html"&gt;severely obese patients with multiple health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is expected more patients will be able to get the jabs from their family doctor as restrictions are relaxed over the next three years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the US, it is estimated about 13 per cent of the population - roughly 33million people - have tried the drugs at least once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the injections have been linked to multiple health benefits that go beyond combating obesity, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13412979/Millions-Brits-Ozempic-slash-chances-heart-attack-stroke-biggest-breakthrough-statins.html"&gt;a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, other studies suggest that could also carry some risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14773791/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-kidney-cancer-risk-study.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;suggested they could raise the risk of a type of cancer that is surging in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:17:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMW85NURTb3B2bXdTZ0RFenpDZkp4UE9tSjZ1R2NxSWFoYzkyRFpxUEVabXJXNzNRMVVpZWtLQ1RKYnRaZVk1Q3JNOUZpRXdZUF84OThUcGtZUDhUWWFhNDFuUng5d3ZDeVVDTm5hVDdyOXVkaG9LYzV1NjFENEE0VDFqWUxNLTU4b0J5VkRBRU5EdGpUcjhiTlFzQldVNlYtbEd0cGpsYW1FekZ0SnM3YlA5X2tPRnM</guid></item><item><title>当我们的大脑空白时会发生什么-雅虎 | What happens when our brain goes blank - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE9BZGtWWHlQWGZDSzNaZFhnZThrcDMzWjRza1NWZlhWM0RMMmIzcGNIWHFTNGZQYXZuWWc4Rk5TZ2pWaEdrTjBvTGMxTmQyQ3hXb1VrbUVyNWE4Q2ItMU1VYmhhVGtDZ28zamlhVHUxYjlCakFI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My thoughts often feel like endless streams of information.

Neuroscientists face significant hurdles in adding color and detail to the mystery of an empty mind, but new research is trying to establish the edges of these formless thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Defining the blank mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/en/directory?uid=u205869" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Athena Demertzi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Athena Demertzi&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Liège, recently published a review paper on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00034-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mind-blanking research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mind-blanking research&lt;/a&gt;. The field has struggled to agree on what the term means–Demertzi’s paper lists no fewer than seven different definitions. Her preferred view is that mind blanking is about “the impression of having no thoughts or not being able to report any thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This interpretation is intentionally vague, as people can use all kinds of language to self-report a mind blank. Examples include “I don’t remember what I was thinking” or “I wasn’t paying attention.” Demertzi says that this can trip up researchers who attempt to incorporate other &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/see-most-detailed-map-human-180000521.html" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; processes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/unique-memory/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, into their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within this broad definition, Demertzi then works to separate different strands of mind blanking. This work is fraught with complications. One of the most reliable tools for examining the brain’s inner workings is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Demertzi explains that fMRI researchers often ask their volunteers to “think of nothing” while in the scanner. Doing so causes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31389642/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:activation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;activation&lt;/a&gt; along the midline of the brain in regions like the cingulate cortex, says Demertzi. However, rather than being a marker of a blank mind, this signal is a cognitive marker of the effort required to suppress thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;A signal behind mind blanking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To block out this signal, Demertzi tried a different strategy. In a 2023 study, her team &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/40/6807.abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:monitored the brains of people at rest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;monitored the brains of people at rest&lt;/a&gt; in a scanner. At random intervals, participants were asked to report what they had been thinking of. The team then analyzed the brain activity patterns in the seconds preceding their response. The brains of individuals who reported blank minds showed a distinct signal, a pattern involving a momentary synchronization of brain networks. “They are all deactivated,” says Demertzi. This signal is also seen during sleep or anesthesia, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This finding is supported by other research that has established &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81618-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a strong link between mind blanking and the level of stimulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a strong link between mind blanking and the level of stimulation&lt;/a&gt; our brains are experiencing, called arousal. When arousal levels are low, mind-blanking episodes are more likely to occur. This is suggested to be because high arousal is necessary to keep up a continuous stream of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There may be a cost to keeping up a very high state of arousal, however. At high levels, this focus tips over into anxiety, which inhibits performance. Demertzi’s paper points out that these anxious states can lead to racing thoughts that may blur individual ideas and make them hard to recall–another form of mind blanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Mind blanking and ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In certain cases, mind blanking can even be a feature of clinical conditions. “We know that it manifests in clinical states like ADHD,” says Demertzi. Unmedicated kids with &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/adhd-may-evolved-us-foraging-130000557.html" data-ylk="slk:ADHD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; report &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617708234" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mind blanking at a higher rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mind blanking at a higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than kids without the condition. Other conditions that feature racing thoughts, like generalized anxiety disorder, also include mind blanking as a related feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The ultimate question for Demertzi is why mind blanking happens in the first place. Researchers are still trying to figure this out, although she suggests that the link to sleep and arousal may be a hint. “When we sleep,” says Demertzi, “Our neurons are getting rest by throwing away what has been accumulated throughout the day through the glymphatic system.” &lt;br&gt;Demertzi says that this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7698404/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:toxin-clearing function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;toxin-clearing function&lt;/a&gt;–which is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01638-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disputed by some sleep neuroscientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disputed by some sleep neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;–may also occur in brief periods while we are awake. We notice these “pit stops” in cognition as mind blanks. Ultimately, these blanks may be a way our brain maintains high function for the rest of our waking experience. “How can you sustain a continuous wakeful life if our brains are not helping a bit?” says Demertzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9BZGtWWHlQWGZDSzNaZFhnZThrcDMzWjRza1NWZlhWM0RMMmIzcGNIWHFTNGZQYXZuWWc4Rk5TZ2pWaEdrTjBvTGMxTmQyQ3hXb1VrbUVyNWE4Q2ItMU1VYmhhVGtDZ28zamlhVHUxYjlCakFI</guid></item><item><title>人民药店：这种非处方过敏药物是否导致我膝盖疼痛？ - OregonLive.com | People’s Pharmacy: Did this OTC allergy medicine cause my excruciating knee pain? - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BWVOY24CQBDELDXQ6NXPISPPEE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR PEOPLE’S PHARMACY:&lt;/b&gt; After trying several nasal sprays and prescription medications for severe seasonal allergies, I was thrilled to find that levocetirizine worked wonders. In January, I started taking one tablet per day. In February, I developed severe knee pain, along with stiffness and soreness throughout my entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C3TWTZ4R55F4FMYGRM4BA2VO6U"&gt;As a very healthy individual, I was scared by the thought of developing severe arthritis. I made an appointment with my primary care physician, but before going, I started to think about what life changes I had made over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T7FFVDSYMZH3ZDVIF3JLAF7RBI"&gt;Starting levocetirizine was the only change.

While FMT aims to restore gut health by transplanting stool microbes from healthy donors, most microbes come from the colon and may colonize unintended regions like the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This misplacement leads to “terraforming,” where microbes change tissue environments to suit their survival. The study urges caution and proposes a new approach—omni-microbial transplants—that better aligns microbes with their native gut environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Mismatch:&lt;/strong&gt; Colon microbes from FMT can colonize unintended gut regions like the small intestine, altering function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; A single FMT caused persistent changes in metabolism, immune activity, and behavior in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers suggest omni-microbial transplants to match microbes with appropriate intestinal regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have been touted as a potential treatment for a variety of conditions, from inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes to autism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of Chicago, however, cautions against widespread use of FMT because of the potential for long-lasting, unintended health consequences for recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FMT involves transferring microbes in the stool from a healthy person to a sick one, in hopes of restoring a healthy equilibrium in the gut microbiome. Since stools contain primarily anaerobic microbes from the colon (i.e. they can’t tolerate oxygen), FMT can cause mismatches in the gut ecosystem when those bacteria colonize the small intestine and other parts of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments with mice and studies with human tissue samples, the researchers conducting the new study saw that anaerobic microbes from the colon not only colonized the small bowel after a single transplant but also persisted there for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes also changed their new intestinal environments to their advantage, “terraforming” them in ways that caused changes in the recipient’s metabolism, behavior, and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there,” said Orlando (Landon) DeLeon, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at UChicago and lead author of the new study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A vast and varied ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FMT is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for treating repeated infections with &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile (C. diff)&lt;/em&gt;, an opportunistic bacterium that often causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation in hospital patients who have been on antibiotics. Seeing the success in treating &lt;em&gt;C. diff &lt;/em&gt;patients, many physicians have been eager to use FMT to treat other digestive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers understand that gut microbiome health can impact all vital organs and systems of the body, so the idea is that replacing a “sick” gut microbiome with a “healthy” one could fix the problem in one fell swoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut isn’t simply one consistent environment with the same microbiota throughout, however; instead, it has several distinct regions that are vastly different microbial ecosystems, each tailored for specific microbes that can provide functions vital to the health of their host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are microbes along the entire intestinal tract, and we just study predominately the last third of it (the colon),” DeLeon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, how can you expect an FMT, with microbes from a third of the intestinal tract at the end of it, to fix the rest of the intestine?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effects of FMT on different parts of the intestine, DeLeon, Eugene B. Chang, MD, the Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine at UChicago and senior author of the study, and their team carried out a series of experiments with mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group of mice was given a transplant of microbes taken from the jejunum, the first portion of the small intestine. A second group was given a standard FMT, and a third group was given a transplant from the cecum, a section connecting the small and large intestine, which has a mixture of microbes from both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recipients of FMT are usually treated with antibiotics first to clear out the microbes living in the gut, leaving a clean slate for newly transplanted microbes to take up residence – sometimes, however, in the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing showed that microbes from each of these transplants successfully colonized the entirety of the intestinal tract in the mice, not just their native niches. This created regional gut mismatches persisting up to three months after just one transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The altered microbiomes also changed the production of metabolites in each intestinal region, which can have health effects on the host. The researchers saw changes in liver metabolism, including activity in genes associated with immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also observed differences in eating behaviors, activity, and energy expenditure in the mice after transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking finding was that having the wrong microbes in the wrong place reshaped the tissue identity to make it more suitable for them. DeLeon saw that mismatches changed gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining in ways that more closely resembled expression levels from the microbes’ original or native intestinal regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like they’re engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,” DeLeon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An ‘omni-microbial’ approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang said that this research highlights the need for more caution with FMT before we fully understand the long-term effects of introducing one set of microbes into a new environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have absolutely no idea what’s in FMT, except that it’s a combination of microbes,” Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But even a single FMT will cause a change in the host-microbe relationships in these very different regions of the bowel that may be very difficult to reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both DeLeon and Chang advocate for “omni-microbial transplants,” or OMT, instead. This approach would transfer microbes taken from all the different regions of the intestine, not just those largely from the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether given via an endoscopy or in pill form, microbes naturally settle in the right places, especially when they are competing side by side with others that normally inhabit a certain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s an open space, something’s going to fill it,” DeLeon said. “But the microbes that were supposed to be there are better suited for it, so they’re more naturally going to fill it even in the presence of other microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeLeon plans to keep studying how different microbes exert their influence in different parts of the intestine, using different approaches like single cell sequencing and metabolomics to track their activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also exploring how the gut regions terraformed by microbiota mismatches can be restored to their original state, which could help restore normal gut function. Such deeper understanding could lead to improvements in the application of microbial transplants, ultimately helping them live up to their significant promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study, “Regional microbiota mismatches from fecal microbiota transplants promote persistent, off-target consequences to the host,” was supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the UChicago GI Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Mora Mocanu, Candace M.

We hypothesized that peroral FMTs create host-microbe mismatches that impact SB homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this, antibiotic-treated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice were given jejunal, cecal, or fecal microbiota transplants (JMTs, CMTs, or FMTs, respectively) and studied 1 or 3 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JMT and FMT altered regional microbiota membership and function, energy balance, and intestinal and hepatic transcriptomes; JMT favored host metabolic pathways and FMT favored immune pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTs drove regional intestinal identity (&lt;em&gt;Gata4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gata6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Satb2&lt;/em&gt;) and downstream differentiation markers. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of metabolite-exposed human enteroids and duodenal biopsies post-FMT confirmed transcriptional changes in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, regional microbial mismatches after FMTs can lead to unintended consequences and require rethinking of microbiome-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:56:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9SaU5vY0tYWm5UT2RzVVhRNy04WXhDWXB5SEpRVkpvZzFCVlJ3NVB1M2k2Ny1TaGY3djV5OGdpTEJSMVhqbFFLeWtWZ05CcGVjV1JWZ2wxWFVkemp4THoxLU00cHdoMjBSTTl0WUlkZw</guid></item><item><title>哈佛医生列出了6种已知会导致癌症的最糟糕的食物：它们的替代品是什么-印度时报 | Harvard doctor lists 6 worst foods that are known to cause cancer: What are their alternatives - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwJBVV95cUxNS2YwcURvdDlxaWNtUGxHelQ3ekJ5WVR2WTkweEZEa3ViTU03NFZKU2VxdUxvUGxsUm5tVmdiOGRmOGgyV3VYYloxZkF3WGxPaEE1SUViTDBYNUc4OHJGNkRyYlVZNGJtTmRJSkROM2F6REZrOWlvenppUFZvUmdWcHZ5cFdmb1pOcHdRd21SdURwVGlhSVF3WkJMSnR1eUo5c2FpdmRNS2Fka3BOcXYzdG5vY3k3N05iY3luSGxiTFE1QXhua1pVMy11ckM0aS0xM0dabnFxcVMtR0N6TExSYzU4Wk1lSS1wejVVN01VcmpCOVAxWVNlczVBTU9rQ2pyazZqRXdQS2lhLXB4Tm9DalRsUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaged snacks, instant noodles, and ready-to-eat meals are seen as saviors in busy routines.

Ultimately, researchers predicted that those with HSV-1 and a specific gene, called the ApoE-e4 gene, had a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston, &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System; and &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study co-author Ruth Itzhaki, Ph.D., summarized her team’s findings in a recent article for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/thirty-years-on-our-research-linking-viral-infections-with-alzheimers-is-finally-getting-the-attention-it-deserves-254656" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and noted that, over the years, additional work has surfaced to support hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But what does it all mean, exactly? If a cold sore pops up, should you be concerned about dementia? We reached out to experts who explained everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“HSV-1 is a common virus to which almost everyone is exposed early in life,” says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston. “It is best known for causing cold sores and is closely related to chicken pox and mononucleosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What these viruses have in common is that they are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/neurotropism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurotropic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;neurotropic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they linger in the nervous system long after the initial illness, explains &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System, and can be reactivated by stress or lowered immunity. That’s how, for instance, chicken pox can manifest later in life as shingles, adds Dr. Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus’s ability to infiltrate the nerves is believed to get it past the blood-brain barrier, a membrane that shields the organ from infection via the bloodstream. Thanks to that entry point, Dr. Hunter says, HSV-1 is the most common cause of viral brain inflammation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is no vaccine for HSV and almost everyone will get it by adulthood,” Dr. Hunter adds. Cold sores are a mild case of it, and symptoms can be treated with antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s may be connected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dormant HSV-1 may be reactivated by illness and reach the brain, explains &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada. This can trigger brain inflammation over time, known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:herpes encephalitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;herpes encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;and in people with genetic risk factors, like the ApoE-4 gene, contribute to Alzheimer’s development, he adds. “We don’t entirely know why ApoE-4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s,” adds Dr. Hunter. “The link to HSV could be that ApoE-4 impacts the blood-brain barrier and makes it easier for HSV to enter.” And the inflammation caused by that entry may heighten Alzheimer’s risk. “It is now universally accepted that inflammation in the brain is a key step in the development of Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Hunter reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What experts think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the three decades since the original study, doctors and researchers have learned much more about Alzheimer’s disease and its connection to viral inflammation. For instance, several &lt;a href="https://www.uth.edu/news/story/several-vaccines-associated-with-reduced-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adults-65-and-older" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that being immunized for any disease (like COVID-19 or the flu) reduces Alzheimer’s risk, says Dr. Hunter. “Several other studies have shown that reducing inflammation in the brain helps prevent Alzheimer’s,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Santos concurs. “Since 1996, additional studies have found HSV-1 DNA in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s. Lab studies have also shown that HSV-1 infection can trigger the buildup of amyloid-beta and tau—proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer’s pathology,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, there are a few disclaimers to note. Firstly, the posed risk is associated with people who contract HSV-1 in early life, giving it time to progressively cause inflammation. The risk may be lower in adults, says Santos. “That said, if someone has other risk factors (like a weakened immune system or APOE-e4), adult-onset HSV-1 could still have long-term consequences,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, neurotropic viruses are extremely common, Dr. Yancey reiterates. “This makes it difficult to tease out whether they are causing neurologic problems or are simply common in the general population, including people with neurologic problems,” she adds. In other words, because most people end up with HSV-1 doesn’t necessarily mean that most people will get Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Most cold sores aren’t a cause for concern,” Santos adds. “They’re common and usually well-controlled by the immune system. But for people with frequent outbreaks, weakened immunity, or APOE-e4, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider. The concern is not a single cold sore, but long-term viral activity in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More research, including long-term studies, is needed to make any solid associations, Santos and Dr. Yancey conclude. “The current data is based on population-level surveys. There is no way to predict on an individual patient’s level whether this has a meaningful impact,” says Dr. Yancey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Future research will, hopefully, at least help experts understand how antiviral treatment affects Alzheimer’s risk, as well as identify better ways to detect when HSV-1 is active in the brain. “The hope is that understanding how infections contribute to Alzheimer’s will open up new ways to prevent or treat it—especially before symptoms start,” says Santos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Lifestyle choices that may help lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Being vaccinated, exercising, engaging in mental stimulation, and maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g33416014/heart-healthy-food-wd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; are all known ways to lower dementia risk, our experts say. Avoiding smoking or nicotine use of any kind can also “drastically” reduce the risk, says Dr. Yancey. All of these habits and choices work together to support both immune and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNRndLVDBRbkl0MWV1TkQ4U2FxeFRuZUt0ZldnTFJud00wdGlieUZ2ODhocGNVZGJIR2w5djB0RmJGNlRaTEJPbEZ4SUM4akdlMWpGeTlMdG9iQThTbEc5dEQ5VUcyRTd3djVsVWNuVEhOS0RpSk0zNjFBbG54OW1oYkdlZzNjZXJIWXowRU5RZw</guid></item><item><title>Aphantasia ：为什么有些人对图像视而不见-神经科学新闻 | Aphantasia: Why Some Minds Are Blind to Images - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE1MXzlsT1pCTWpFUEJLRzI4R3gwLXVtZUdfR3hvZ1duVWUyTlpoRFVMRmdhSEw2NUU4VkxNY3lxdGZSMy01TkN5d0pKcUpJRVpkUEExNG1QNEZkQUIzd2xmcklONWlvTWFFUGxn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have uncovered how the brains of people with aphantasia, those who cannot visualize mental images, process visual information differently. Although key visual and memory-related brain regions still activate during mental imagery tasks, they show weaker connectivity compared to individuals with typical visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports the idea that the richness of mental imagery depends on how well the brain integrates signals across these regions. Despite their lack of internal visuals, aphantasic individuals retain strong visual knowledge, showing that mental imagery isn’t necessary for understanding or creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aphantasia Defined:&lt;/strong&gt; About 4% of people are unable to voluntarily visualize mental images.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Aphantasic individuals activate similar brain areas during imagery tasks but with weaker network integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental imagery quality depends on connectivity between attention, memory, and visual regions—not just activation alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Paris Brain Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks to 7T fMRI, researchers from Paris Brain Institute and NeuroSpin, the CEA’s neuroimaging centre, are exploring the neural substrate of visual imagery at very high resolution for the first time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results, published in &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt;, pave the way for a better understanding of this fascinating cognitive ability, which some of us entirely lack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110754"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/aphantasia-neuroimaging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future studies will help determine whether aphantasia manifests in the same way for all affected individuals or whether there are subtypes linked to different causes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual imagery—the ability to mentally summon the image of a landscape, a person, or an object that is not directly observable—varies greatly in intensity from one individual to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can recall a detailed city map and walk through each street as if watching a movie. Thinking of a loved one, others may barely make out their silhouette and hair color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, about 4% of the population seems completely unable to visualize a scene on demand: this is known as aphantasia, a cognitive peculiarity known for over a century but only recently studied by scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary studies suggest that aphantasia is present from birth and often affects multiple members of the same family. While it is not considered a disorder, it is frequently associated with a weaker-than-average autobiographical memory, difficulty recognizing faces, or even autism spectrum disorder. However, these associations remain uncertain and hard to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what characterizes aphantasia at the brain level, we needed to study the neural mechanisms involved in visual imagery and perception. For this, we took advantage of 7-Tesla fMRI, which allows us to observe brain activity at extremely high resolution,” said Paolo BARTOLOMEO Inserm, co-leader of the PICNIC team at Paris Brain InstituteMRI Scans of Inner Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most previous studies on aphantasia relied on highly subjective tests in which participants had to self-evaluate their visualization abilities. Under such conditions, it’s difficult to determine whether these tests actually assess mental imagery or instead reflect metacognition, that is, a person’s ability to describe their own mental processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Stanislas Dehaene’s team at NeuroSpin, the CEA’s brain imaging center, postdoctoral researcher Jianghao Liu, Paolo Bartolomeo, and their colleagues sought to examine the characteristics of aphantasic individuals more objectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to identify the precise neural circuits involved in mental imagery and visual perception. Most importantly, we aimed to understand how visual information is processed in the brain in the absence of visual stimuli,” said Jianghao LIU Postdoctoral researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visualizing a scene with the “mind’s eye” is cognitively complex. It involves experiencing an object’s visual properties without the object being present. This process not only recruits brain circuits linked to sensory experience but also draws on language and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To break down this process, the researchers recruited 10 aphantasic subjects and 10 subjects with “typical” mental imagery. These individuals underwent ultra-high-field functional MRI while responding, from memory, to questions about the visual features of familiar objects, words, faces, and places.A Connectivity Deficit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that attempting mental visualization activates fronto-parietal networks, which are important for attention, awareness, and working memory, as well as the left fusiform gyrus, located on the underside of the temporal lobe. It also activates areas of the ventral temporal cortex involved in letter recognition, face perception, and color processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among aphantasic individuals—even if they report no experience of mental imagery—these same regions were also activated, but with reduced functional connectivity. In other words, these areas communicated less efficiently than in people with typical mental imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These preliminary findings support a hypothesis already considered by researchers: the quality of visual experience, whether based on perception or imagination, depends on how well information is integrated between fronto-parietal networks and visual perception networks. The left prefrontal cortex might play a causal role in the awareness of these visual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This might explain why aphantasic people still retain accurate visual knowledge of objects. For example, they clearly remember that spinach is a darker green than lettuce,” Liu notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will help determine whether aphantasia manifests in the same way for all affected individuals or whether there are subtypes linked to different causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to highlighting the extreme variability in how we experience the world, research on aphantasia shows that mental imagery is not a prerequisite for reasoning, imagination, conceptualization, or creativity. Ultimately, these studies may illuminate the relationships between mental imagery, perception, memory, and neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by Dassault Systèmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aphantasia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parisbraininstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paolo Bartolomeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parisbraininstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paris Brain Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paolo Bartolomeo – Paris Brain Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia&lt;/a&gt;” by Jianghao Liu et al. &lt;em&gt;Cortex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.12.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontoparietal asymmetries leading to conscious perception&lt;/a&gt;” by Jianghao Liu et al. &lt;em&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual imagery is, for most of us, a conspicuous ingredient of everyday experience, playing a prominent role in memory, daydreaming and creativity. Galton, who pioneered the quantitative study of visual imagery with his famous ‘breakfast-table survey’, reported a wide variation in its subjective vividness (Galton, 1880).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, some participants described ‘no power of visualising’. This phenomenon has received little attention since, though Faw reported that 2.1–2.7% of 2,500 participants ‘claim no visual imagination’ (Faw, 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience of voluntary imagery is associated with activity in fronto-parietal ‘executive’ systems and in posterior brain regions which together enable us to generate images on the basis of our stored knowledge of appearances (Bartolomeo, 2008). The relative contributions of lower and higher order visual regions to the experience of visual imagery are debated (Bartolomeo, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical reports suggest the existence of two major types of neurogenic visual imagery impairment: i) visual memory disorders, causing both visual agnosia and imagery loss, and ii) ‘imagery generation’ deficits selectively disabling imagery (Farah, 1984).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 we reported a particularly ‘pure’ case of imagery generation disorder, in a 65 year old man who became unable to summon images to the mind’s eye after coronary angioplasty (Zeman et al., 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a popular description of our paper (Zimmer, 2010), we were contacted by over twenty individuals who recognised themselves in the article’s account of ‘blind imagination’, with the important difference that their imagery impairment had been lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we describe the features of their condition, elicited by a questionnaire, and suggest a name – &lt;em&gt;aphantasia&lt;/em&gt; – for this poorly recognised phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontoparietal asymmetries leading to conscious perception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent human intracerebral recordings reveal that frontoparietal circuits linked by the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) have critical, hemisphere-asymmetric contributions to conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-hemisphere networks are crucial for attention-based prioritization of information; left-hemisphere regions contribute to perceptual decisions and model building. These asymmetries confirm and specify clinical evidence from neglect patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:29:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1MXzlsT1pCTWpFUEJLRzI4R3gwLXVtZUdfR3hvZ1duVWUyTlpoRFVMRmdhSEw2NUU4VkxNY3lxdGZSMy01TkN5d0pKcUpJRVpkUEExNG1QNEZkQUIzd2xmcklONWlvTWFFUGxn</guid></item><item><title>独家|医生驳斥了我令人不安的症状，但我推了—我怎么知道是癌症-《纽约邮报》 | Exclusive | Doctors dismissed my troubling symptom but I pushed — how I knew it was cancer - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPQ3dSeGk4ZDJjMUJRS0hJZUZjakxWWkVOTnFaVHh0ckdfWkpXSnNZUEdGNmVMRTRRSHRJdUdvQlR5aGNqaExFNng1dml5bmxOUUZyZW9fUFdWbTIzbG53SzY0Z3ZyVElrazktZ1RHNDJsZnZMbW85eGQxYTgzbm9FZ1oybmhmcGVSa2VjTUxENTl1ZnVQZ190eg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Mills is used to seeing spots — but this one was different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old public school teacher rushed to a dermatologist after a small mark suddenly appeared on her right cheek, the threat of skin cancer weighing on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of a diagnosis, Mills got dismissed. “They were worried about me getting a scar on my face and not wanting to test it,” she told The Post. “That’s when I sought a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma is on the rise among young women, including survivors like Jackie Mills. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing she did. Tests at Mount Sinai revealed the spot was stage zero melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer that’s been rising rapidly in young adults, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for spreading quickly throughout the body, melanoma can become life-threatening in as little as six weeks if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mole patrol&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a family history of melanoma, Mills was no stranger to skin checks and gets a full-body scan from her dermatologist once a year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While she’s “covered with spots,” the mark on her cheek stood out when it began to change and grow rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I noticed was that there was some discoloration, one side of it was lighter than the other side, ” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What really set me off was that the borders were very jagged and irregular. The shape was also strange, it wasn’t a perfect circle,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A brown, irregularly shaped spot with jagged edges appeared on Mills’ cheek.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those are classic red flags for skin cancer, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jesse-miller-lewin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Jesse Miller Lewin&lt;/a&gt;, vice chair of surgical operations and system chief of the Division of Dermatologic and Cosmetic Surgery at Mount Sinai Health System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told The Post that one easy way to remember the warning signs is to follow the ABCDEs of melanoma:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; is for asymmetry: Cancerous moles tend to be misshapen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; is for border: Melanomas often have jagged, uneven edges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; is for color: Look out for lesions that are more than one color or shade.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; is for diameter: Spots larger than 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) are a concern.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; is for evolution: Changes in a mole’s size, shape or color can signal danger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A history of change or “evolution” of an existing pigmented lesion is the most predictive sign of melanoma among all the ABCDE criteria,” Lewin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No moles? That doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. Most melanomas appear as brand-new spots on previously clear, healthy skin. The cancer can develop anywhere, including the eyes, scalp, nails, feet and even inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Face to face with cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma may be one of the deadliest skin cancers. However, if caught early, it’s highly treatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma signs include changes in the size, shape or color of a mole or new skin growth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pixel-Shot – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed at stage zero, the five-year survival rate is over 99%. But once it spreads to distant organs and body parts, like the lungs or bones, that number nosedives to just 35%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates-for-melanoma-skin-cancer-by-stage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a blessing and a curse that this was on my face,” Mills said. “It made it harder to remove, and I do have a scar, but I think it’s why I noticed the changes so quickly and they caught it at stage zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think if this spot was in a different part of my body, I wouldn’t have noticed how quickly it was changing and it could have been a very different outcome for me,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of her diagnosis, Mills underwent Mohs surgery at Mount Sinai. The highly technical procedure involves removing skin in layers, examining each under a microscope until all the cancer cells are gone while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Jesse Lewin removed Mills’ melanoma with minimal scarring. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Melanoma has cells that can be visible on slides under the microscope extending beyond what you can be see with the naked eye,” Lewin said. “If cells are left behind the melanoma can get deeper or spread to lymph nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the original spot was tiny — no bigger than the top of a push pin — by the time Lewin was done removing the cancer, Mills had a wound about the size of a quarter on her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took about a year for the wound to fully heal and the scar to fade. To minimize it, she turned to laser treatments and silicone scar cream.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Now most people can’t even really tell that I have a scar,” Mills said. “The only people that know are the people that knew me at the time, it’s healed really, really nicely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scan it, spot it, stop it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now 34 and cancer-free, Mills sees the dermatologist twice a year and uses advanced technologies like the Vectra scan to monitor any changes in her skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you get a full body yearly scan, you’re relying on your dermatologist to record and remember your moles and your spots from the year before,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vectra WB360 scan, by contrast, is a 3D whole-body imaging system with more than 40 cameras that can document all of your freckles, moles and other growths in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Vectra body scanner at Mount Sinai is the only device of its kind in New York City.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“If you’re someone with a skin type that has a lot of spots, this is a really good option because it’s an added layer of protection,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now you can have the doctor’s eyes and a computerized scan of your entire body, which can measure the size and the pigment and the type of spots that you have and compare them from year to year,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re average risk for skin cancer, get a full head-to-toe check by a dermatologist once a year, according to Lewin. But if you’ve got a history, he recommends going twice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to wait for your annual appointment to stay on top of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are an important tool, but you are your first line of defense when it comes to dermatology,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors recommend that people regularly conduct self-exams for melanoma. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you run into a dismissive provider like Mills did, don’t back down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hesitation when it comes to melanoma could be the difference between a simple removal and getting chemotherapy, because that’s how quickly it moves and how deadly it is,” Mills said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewin echoed her warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Trust your gut — if a lesion on your skin is new or changing and you are concerned, see a dermatologist,” he said. “If you remain concerned after seeing one doctor, get a second opinion. Because [Mills] did that, it saved her life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;If you’ve had melanoma before, you are more likely to develop it again.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dark side of sun kissed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma makes up just 1% of all skin cancers, but it causes the vast majority of skin cancer deaths, according to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;group estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 104,960 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the US, and roughly 8,430 Americans will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While melanoma risk increases with age, &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/112435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that rates among children, adolescents and young adults have increased by more than 250% over the past four decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soaking up UV rays — whether from the sun or tanning beds — is a major risk factor for melanoma. Having a lot of moles or lighter skin, hair or eyes increases your chances, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your odds also go up if you have a weakened immune system or a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Michael Aziz, an attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, told the Daily Mail&lt;span&gt;: 'Rebounding or jumping on a mini trampoline offers many health benefits, including improved heart health, increased metabolism and enhanced lymphatic system function.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exercise strengthens the heart muscle, leading to lower blood pressure and resting heart rate, enhances blood circulation and oxygen delivery throughout the body, while also boosting how it flushes out toxins and potentially harmful waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebounding also builds endurance, making it easier to perform other exercises and daily activities - and, over time, increases metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Rebounding' is a form of exercise that involves jumping and and bouncing on mini trampoline to improve overall health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-products-module health two-up" id="mol-5937ce50-4203-11f0-8ad8-59b626c82747"&gt;&lt;div class="ml-ui-list"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Michael Aziz is an attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Aziz estimated that 15 minutes of rebounding can burn about 150 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, a 15-minute walk at a moderate pace typically burns around 60 to 100 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While running five miles per hour for 15 minutes burns 120 calories for a person weighing 125 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To lose one pound of fat in a week, a person needs to create a calorie deficit of 3,500 over seven days - 500 fewer calories per day - either through diet or exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To achieve that, someone could rebound for about 50 minutes per day, compared with two hours of walking or an hour of running. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Aziz said: 'It is great for those who need cardio work but without the burnout of the treadmill. It is also low impact so it is easier on joints than cycling and jogging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The workouts often involves jogging on the spot, performing jumping jacks, split jumps, hand to knee taps and crunches - high intensity moves that supercharge calorie burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those looking to start rebounding, Dr Aziz advises starting slowly and building up. 'If you go harder, rebounding can be a form of a high intensity training workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'High intensity interval training or HIIT has the most impact on longevity and can add nine years to your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's years beyond both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Jumping on a mini trampoline, can also help with balance and coordination skills.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For optimal weight loss results, experts recommend that people rebound for at least 20 to 30 minutes, three to five times per week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that rebounding was also good for those suffering from joint pain and older people with arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While running is primarily a lower-body workout, rebounding distributes the force across the entire body, reducing joint strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just this week a study found that 35- to 50-year-olds who regularly run marathons are more likely to develop &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14768309/colon-cancer-running-asco-2025.html"&gt;precancerous tumors in their colon&lt;/a&gt;, precursors of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 100 patients studied by DC-based scientists, 41 per cent were found to have at least one adenoma - a benign tumor that can develop into the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fifteen per cent had advanced adenomas, or more advanced growths with more than half reporting rectal bleeding, a potential warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Timothy Cannon, the medical oncologist who led the research, told the Daily Mail that the results were higher than what doctors would expect in the general population and warranted further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon said that any long-distance runners experiencing signs of colon cancer, such as rectal bleeding, should be tested for the disease, regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was observational so it is not clear if distance running raises the risk or if other lifestyle factors, such as diet, play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research findings" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683f1d49e4b00646f8249f94" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from one observational study show that microplastics found in arteries may potentially increase the risk of having a stroke and heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re concerned about your microplastic exposure — and how your kitchen habits may be playing a role — we have some good news.

Blood pressure check:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin annual checks from age 18. High blood pressure often has no symptoms but can silently damage the heart, kidneys, and brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Lipid profile (cholesterol levels):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start testing at age 35, or earlier with risk factors like smoking or diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol is a major contributor to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Blood sugar (fasting glucose or HbA1c):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screen every 3 years from age 35, and annually if overweight or with a family history. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly common and often undetected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Colorectal cancer screening:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin at age 45. A colonoscopy every 10 years, or stool-based tests more frequently, can detect precancerous polyps early.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Prostate cancer screening:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men over 50—or 45 with family history—should discuss PSA testing and digital rectal exam (DRE) with their physician to assess need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual measurements help monitor obesity risk, linked to diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/essential-health-checks-every-woman-should-know-101713849088530.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Essential health checks every woman should know"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential health checks every woman should know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/29/original/slimming-2728331_1280_1748502240953.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="BMI test can help in reducing obesity risk.(Pixabay)" title="BMI test can help in reducing obesity risk.(Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;BMI test can help in reducing obesity risk.(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Liver function and hepatitis B/C screening:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important for men with alcohol use, fatty liver, or viral exposure risks. Early intervention prevents liver damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Thyroid function (TSH):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check every 5 years after 35, or earlier if symptoms like fatigue or weight gain arise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.
