After enrolling, more than 106,000 adults were invited to participate in the sub-study on physical activity. The final sample, stratified into five groups, or quintiles, of physical activity levels, included about 85,000 participants with a median age of 63 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XLFYPEMYH5AWNGSRPSI6RVM7G4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study had participants use an accelerometer &lt;b&gt;— &lt;/b&gt;a device that measures movement&lt;b&gt; — &lt;/b&gt;for seven days to measure sedentary time, step count and activity intensity, and to quantify daily levels of activity and energy expenditure. The measures were compared with&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the initial diagnosis of 13 cancers associated with low physical activity: bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal, upper stomach, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, myeloid leukemia, myeloma and rectal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7WSEV6RRBGHTJKHTY7CT7Y26E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The research identified an inverse relationship between overall daily physical activity and cancer risk, indicating that even modest increases in activity levels were sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of the 13 cancers. Individuals in the second-highest quintile of physical activity had a 16 percent lower risk compared with those in the lowest quintile. Higher levels of activity had a more protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VAMOZNS3IVBUJO552IGCEAB6GM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other measures of physical activity were also correlated with lower rates of cancer.

This may help cut back on unnecessary dermatologist referrals and biopsies in underserved areas, says Mitchell A. Kline, a clinical assistant professor at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q4MOVSVZ2VFS3JFHGLKGCIEYJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The devices are intended for general practitioners and other health-care professionals who don’t specialize in dermatology, but Kline is using them anyway to occasionally assist with a tough call over whether to biopsy something and for data collection. He says the real potential value of the tools is for clinicians whose ability to diagnose is less reliable and who don’t have access to other diagnostic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BGJ3ZJTM2RHXDOARGXTTGCAPOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One such product, DermaSensor, funded &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10631325/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that was published in the Journal of Primary Care &amp;amp; Community Health and pointed to promising early data on its use by primary care physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UPOP3SR2AZBN7I6LWIKFKORBTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;DermaSensor did a reasonable job of picking up skin cancers, but it also had a high rate of false positives and does not work with all types of lesions, according to Roxana Daneshjou, an assistant professor of biomedical science and dermatology at Stanford University. But her biggest concern, one echoed by other experts, is whether such models have been tested or trained on diverse skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKA7AKY7GJDXNMNTDAXJDSWB3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other companies in the marketplace include Skin Analytics, approved in the European Union as a medical device, and Nevisense, another U.S.-based company whose device gained &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm?id=P150046" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Drug Administration premarket approval&lt;/a&gt; for detecting melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="NFED2CLFPBBBDOKNW7M2BFGS74" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="NFED2CLFPBBBDOKNW7M2BFGS74"&gt;A next-level skin check&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E6HR22BL3ZBTJACD652DEGEF7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sloan Kettering and other institutions use 3D scanners to photograph and monitor patients with complex melanoma risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5QGT5Q2SCFG4XPS2GBL7SYPKBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The next time they come in, you’re monitoring all those lesions for change,” Rotemberg says. “Patients have access to the images when they’re performing their self-examinations, so they can also either reassure themselves or flag suspicious lesions for their doctor to take a closer look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6AA73AFNJB3TI64QAMTN457NM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today, AI is used as part of the 3D body scan for rendering the images and image reconstruction, Rotemberg says. The 2.0 version of this would entail bringing in AI to automatically detect skin cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KZLLSHVPUZDZBFK6BU5ABTWKKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We need a lot more research, but we’re actively working on it,” Rotemberg says. “We recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03743-w" target="_blank"&gt;published a dataset&lt;/a&gt; of over 400,000 tiles cropped from total-body photography so that people can try to develop algorithms,” she says. Because of the volume and quality of the photographs, they’re “super challenging” for a dermatologist to interpret, she explains. “So this is a huge opportunity for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FV7XJGEL75ADPHR6OQBD66VWKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some companies offer services like this already, but the experts note that they have not seen any publicly available data that proves their efficacy or regulatory status in the United States or abroad. Daneshjou adds that there may be companies doing trials that would then apply for FDA clearance. “I do think it is coming down the pipe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OZALPMMK5RDGDEWENEPRTS4SHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lee also says there could be a future where these full-body scans are made widely accessible — and that would be a positive. “Anything to improve access to screening and to high-quality care is something we need to do better at,” she says. That would require solid scientific evidence that shows it’s safe, cost-effective and equitable, as well as regulatory work to ensure it’s sustainable and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CN2T3AY5PVC7PE36ZSKPZQRS3M" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CN2T3AY5PVC7PE36ZSKPZQRS3M"&gt;Not ready for prime time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UC6L2IYQUZCRZMYR5YVP5D6N6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But experts advise against using apps and chat bots to diagnose skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INZI4KRAMNALLJD3DBGIIUOCDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s actually quite problematic because [these apps] have not cleared any regulatory hurdles, and some of them are making claims around being able to diagnose skin cancer and there’s no actual available data to back up their claims,” says Daneshjou, who co-wrote a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2815800" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic in JAMA Dermatology&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in 2024 with Rotemberg and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBV4ZYNEFJD6JFEHF4P3Q7OIFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mobile apps and chatbots may be “dangerous because oftentimes we turn to these tools as patients because we can’t get access to health care,” Lee says, adding that data privacy and security should also be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BO7NJWQZFVH3LFJGEQWNHHV4FE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts also do not recommend using ChatGPT and other large language models to analyze your skin lesions. “What we have found from prior work is that these models don't do that great on skin cancer diagnosis,” Daneshjou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MOQ2NN7YZRGVBJEIZZDEVQYLH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rotemberg says direct-to-consumer products remain the “furthest away” from being useful for patients, although it’s “a very promising area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRGENJQJOBDQXEXC33M4FFWPTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As of now the gold standard is to get an annual skin check with a dermatologist, Lee says.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;New research suggests that given the right kind of training, AI bots can deliver mental health therapy with as much efficacy as — or more than — human clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The recent&lt;a href="https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2400802" target="_blank"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, shows results from the first randomized clinical trial for AI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Dartmouth College built the bot as a way of taking a new approach to a longstanding problem: The U.S. continues to grapple with an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/12/06/1217487323/psychologists-waitlist-demand-mental-health-care" target="_blank"&gt;acute shortage&lt;/a&gt; of mental health providers. "I think one of the things that doesn't scale well is humans," says Nick Jacobson, a clinical psychologist who was part of this research team. For every 340 people in the U.S., there is just one mental health clinician, according to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/news/mha-releases-2024-state-of-mental-health-in-america-report/" target="_blank"&gt;some estimates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While many AI bots already on the market claim to offer mental health care, some have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/10/nx-s1-5222574/kids-character-ai-lawsuit" target="_blank"&gt;dubious results&lt;/a&gt; or have even &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists#:~:text=APA%20met%20with%20federal%20regulators,director%20of%20health%20care%20innovation." target="_blank"&gt;led people to self-harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than five years ago, Jacobson and his colleagues began training their AI bot in clinical best practices. The project, says Jacobson, involved much &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/01/19/1147081115/therapy-by-chatbot-the-promise-and-challenges-in-using-ai-for-mental-health" target="_blank"&gt;trial and error&lt;/a&gt; before it led to quality outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The effects that we see strongly mirror what you would see in the best evidence-based trials of psychotherapy," says Jacobson. He says these results were comparable to "studies with folks given a gold standard dose of the best treatment we have available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers gathered a group of roughly 200 people who had diagnosable conditions like depression and anxiety, or were at risk of developing eating disorders. Half of them worked with AI therapy bots. Compared to those that did not receive treatment, those who did showed significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising results, says Jacobson, was the quality of the bond people formed with their bots. "People were really developing this strong relationship with an ability to trust it," says Jacobson, "and feel like they can work together on, on their mental health symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Strength of bonds and trust with therapists is one of the overall predictors of efficacy in talk and cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of AI therapy is the lack of time constraints. Jacobson said he and his team were surprised by how frequently patients accessed their AI therapists. " We had folks that were messaging it about their insomnia symptoms in the middle of the night," he says, "and getting their needs met in these moments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Psychological Association has raised the alarm recently about the &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists#:~:text=APA%20met%20with%20federal%20regulators,director%20of%20health%20care%20innovation." target="_blank"&gt;dangers of using unregulated AI therapy bots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the organization says it's pleased with the rigorous clinical training that researchers invested in this model.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The therabot in this study checks a bunch of the boxes that we have been hoping technologists would start to engage in," says Vaile Wright, director for the Office of Health Care Innovation at the APA. "It is rooted in psychological science. It is demonstrating some efficacy and safety, and it's been co-created by subject matter experts for the purposes of addressing mental health issues."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dartmouth researchers stress that the technology is still a long way from market and say they need to run additional trials on the therabot before it will be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, Wright says, human therapists should not be intimidated by their AI counterparts. Given the tremendous shortage of mental health providers, " I don't think humans need to be concerned that they're going to be put out of business," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says the country needs all the quality therapists we can get — be they human or bot.&lt;/p&gt;

By studying the data of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/virus-likely-triggers-almost-all-multiple-sclerosis-massive-study-concludes-62236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;10 million former military personnel&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Ascherio’s work showed that MS is almost always a delayed response to infection with the EBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he epidemiology of multiple sclerosis is quite unique because there is a very striking geographical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Alberto Ascherio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had known that there was something odd about the development of MS, and attributed it to the so-called hygiene hypothesis. This is the idea that in our modern world, children are not getting enough early exposure to microorganisms in order to develop a healthy immune system. However, finding the connection was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started with the observation that the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis is quite unique because there is a very striking geographical distribution,” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/alberto-ascherio/" target="_blank"&gt;Professor Ascherio&lt;/a&gt; told IFLScience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very uncommon in tropical areas, and then the incidence tends to increase in temperate zones. For people who migrate from areas of high incidence to low incidence, the risk goes down, and for people who migrate from the tropics to Europe or Canada, the risk goes up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompted Ascherio to look at something in the environment or lifestyle that could explain this distribution. Untangling the issue with the hygiene hypothesis, Ascherio noticed the connection between infectious mononucleosis, primarily caused by EBV, and the risk of developing MS. Over time, overwhelming evidence linking the two has been brought forward, although the exact mechanism is not fully clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One popular theory is that it's a cross-reactivity between the immune response against the EBV and some human proteins that are expressed in the brain,” Professor Ascherio explained. “The hypothesis is attractive because it would provide sort of a straightforward explanation, but I'm rather skeptical about this explanation. An alternative explanation is that the disease is caused by viral reactivation in the central nervous system in the brain or spinal cord.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between the virus and disease has opened new ways to consider how MS might be treated. Antiviral drugs are being investigated in clinical trials as possible add-ons to the standard MS treatment. There’s also the possibility that a vaccine might be useful, in particular, one that modifies the immune response, and so maybe stops MS completely. Ascherio is upfront that this development won’t be a matter of months, but of many years, though he’s optimistic that there is “a lot of research that hopefully will bring us somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's like we've built the equivalent of JWST to study the universe, but now we don't have the funding to launch it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Alberto Ascherio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of hesitation there, but it has nothing to do with the scientific challenges. Instead, it is because of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-us-government-just-cut-10000-jobs-dismantling-its-safety-net-for-americans-health-78656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;devastating cuts to research&lt;/a&gt; into cures for diseases by the Trump administration, through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr..

Unfortunately, we are struggling to get funding to move forward with this research. It's like we've built the equivalent of JWST to study the universe, but now we don't have the funding to launch it!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize, worth $3 million, will be split equally between Ascherio and Hauser, and hopefully, more contributions will continue to push this vital area of medical research forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 09:58:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQOVJmRVJUYmpkODcwcVQ4dWRXNXAzUXN3Z3RmMllfYkYwQzM4U1BnUXBOMFZYWnh5aERIMHJhYlRTdExFRmVZUkxLMXZoTEZnSEpZcjFlNHJMU2kzTHcyRFNxcC02U2FwSTJ4dk5URkx3bXNxNWlOWjF5UF91WEJJMmt5V0NrdE94S1pBNkNnU3EwMWw2VFBmRl9NZXl4YkRZdDFzblJzc2pudkhEbTdTU2gyMjhzaUU</guid></item><item><title>Rare virus that killed Gene Hackman’s wife kills three in small California town - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPbmpSOVFWUUd0WkJfdk1WTDc3UnM3QUNFRHlldXRYcVJONGt2NDJ3TmhsTTZFWUFXd21kMUhLZUFUVThFZ1RzV0JiZHZCX1F2T0EwTjJQSU5yY1RtODloanJJMEhTazh2Zml4dkxtN0tpdVhUZEh5VHlwdXZrcTlwY1dqVTluZzNmQzBHeXI0YlpCQzQ5Z1kzbXlhOUYtanFkWWE3cg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 fsDBBo sc-jbiisr-1 gfSVvz" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cwDkqf" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 guIZJM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 ghpvHl"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dyeFNc"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 QyvDf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 hjfIlW"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 bXNazX sc-hez36s-16 eFHwkn"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 lpmrWp"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 kHOfxf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 llSPWP"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 ctaaNX"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 zTiwj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus, which is rare, shot to public attention after a New Mexico medical examiner announced that Gene Hackman’s wife &lt;a href="/news/health/betsy-arakawa-hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome-b2715984.html"&gt;Betsy Arakawa had died after contracting the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodies of Arakawa, 65, and actor Hackman, 95, were&lt;a href="/arts-entertainment/films/news/gene-hackman-cause-death-betsy-arakawa-investigation-b2711170.html"&gt; found in their Santa Fe home in February,&lt;/a&gt; sometime after they died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dgbiJn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/21/58/AP25058352785882.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/21/58/AP25058352785882.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/21/58/AP25058352785882.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A medical examiner announced that Gene Hackman’s wife Betsy Arakawa died after contracting hantavirus pulmonary syndrome" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-11295"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;A medical examiner announced that Gene Hackman’s wife Betsy Arakawa died after contracting hantavirus pulmonary syndrome&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggested Arakawa died about two weeks before their bodies were found, while Hackman died about a week later from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mono County health office said that about one in three people infected with Hantavirus die, adding that prompt diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US began recording cases of the virus in 1993, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 864 laboratory-confirmed cases had been recorded across the country by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that states in the southwest, in particular, have recorded the highest number of cases.

Scores which are below the average could indicate a risk for poor health outcomes, such as falls. For example, for a person aged between 60-64, the average is 14 for a man, and 12 for a woman. If you are aged 85-89, however, the average score is eight. However, these average scores do not take into account a person's medical history – for example if they have recently undergone surgery or have an injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The test can also be beneficial for younger people or those with no health conditions, as it is a good measure of fitness, particularly lower body muscular strength and endurance. Researchers in Switzerland asked almost &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-013-0504-z" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;7,000 adults&lt;/a&gt; to do the STS test and then compared the results. They found that the average score for 20–24-year-olds was 50/minute for men and 47/minute for women. Some of those taking part, however, were able to perform as many as 72 repetitions in a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In another study &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2018/01050/the_relationship_of_sit_to_stand_tests_with.18.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;of healthy volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, who had an average age of 21, researchers found a strong association between the results of the sit-to-stand test and a different – but more time-consuming – measure of their aerobic capacity and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Research shows that how well you perform on the test can also tell healthcare providers a great deal about your underlying health. For example a low score on the test can be used to identify people who might be at risk of worse outcomes after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33356620" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt; or after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11215763/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cancer treatment.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if a person scores less on the test than the "average" for their age group then they are also at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/STEADI-Assessment-30Sec-508.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;greater risk of falls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What we're really worried about is that if people don't maintain their strength, their balance, their flexibility and their cardiovascular health, then they're more likely to fall," says Dhesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;About 30% of people aged over 65 have a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/scorecard/8135" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;fall every year,&lt;/a&gt; and that rises to about 50% in people aged over 80 years.

If mobility is difficult, you can start by doing seated exercises that can be used to build up strength. From there, you could move to standing up perhaps five times every hour or two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you are able, simply walking up and down your living room and making sure that you are going up and down the stairs at least three or four times a day can also make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You want to avoid 'bungalow legs' [i.e. weak legs from living in a single-storey home] – essentially you want to make sure you can carry on going up and down stairs using those muscles, maintaining your balance, and remaining independent," says Dhesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dhesi also advises people to go out and join exercise classes if they can. Many gyms run exercise programs for seniors at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The added benefit there is the social contact on top of the physical contact. And we know that that's a really important aspect of as you get older – loneliness and social isolation can really be detrimental for your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Finally, other tips include keeping moving and doing housework. For older adults, playing with your grandkids if you have them – getting down on the floor with them, and getting up off the floor with them – can be helpful.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/20/1163697875/colon-cancer-signs-screening-young-adult" target="_blank"&gt;it's on the rise among younger adults &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. But&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35727" target="_blank"&gt; research recently published in the journal Cancer,&lt;/a&gt; finds regular exercise can help survivors live longer — in some cases, even longer than people who've never had colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the important message is, some level of activity is better than staying inactive," says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/jeffrey-a-meyerhardt" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jeff Meyerhardt,&lt;/a&gt; co-director of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the study's senior author. He says the results suggest exercise can have a "meaningful impact" on a patient's long-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to colon cancer, the good news is that overall, death rates have been falling thanks to improvements in screening and treatment. But survivors still tend to have a shorter life expectancy than people of the same age and sex in the general population, in large part because of the risk that the cancer will come back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meyerhardt says researchers have long known that exercise can improve survival rates in colon cancer patients. But he and his colleagues wanted to know if regular physical activity could actually help patients improve their survival rates compared to people who'd never had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So they surveyed nearly 3,000 colon cancer patients about their exercise habits before and after treatment. What they found was that, for patients who were three years out from treatment and cancer free, regular exercise made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Those patients not only had a better overall survival if they were more physically active, they actually looked like they had a slightly better overall survival compared to the general population," Meyerhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even patients whose cancer recurred had improvements in survival if they had more regular exercise compared to patients who were the least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Patients who saw benefits were exercising the equivalent of walking about an hour a day at a 2-to-3 mile per hour pace about six days a week, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/faculty_info.aspx/Schmitz7385" target="_blank"&gt;Kathryn Schmitz&lt;/a&gt; is an exercise oncology researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and the director of the Moving Through Cancer Program at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. She's a firm believer in the power of exercise both to reduce the risk of dying from colon cancer and to prevent it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I know of nothing else that is within the patient's control that is more powerful for reducing cancer mortality, particularly colon cancer mortality, than physical activity," Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to figure out the mechanisms at play. But Schmitz says evidence from animal models suggests that physical activity triggers a series of chemical reactions in cells that promote health in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What you might think of is that all of our cells are bathed in a soup of sorts, and the constituents of that soup change as a result of being more physically active," Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you're sedentary, your immune system doesn't work as well, and your cells are more prone to inflammation, which can cause cells to mutate, she says. But when you exercise on a regular basis, your inflammation goes down and your immune function is better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The soup in which your cells are bathed is healthier in a way that will tamp down any cancer development or cancer progression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Exercise &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt;can also improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and insulin plays a role in spurring the growth of colorectal cancer cells, says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/kimmie-ng" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng&lt;/a&gt;, founding director of the Young Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And at a time when colon and rectal cancer &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/20/1163697875/colon-cancer-signs-screening-young-adult" target="_blank"&gt;rates are rising among people under 50&lt;/a&gt;, it's more important than ever to get the word out about exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ng says researchers don't know exactly what's driving the "alarming" rise in cancers of the colon and rectum in adults under 50, but research suggests colorectal cancer is strongly linked to several modifiable lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Out of all these factors, Ng says, "exercise probably has some of the strongest data supporting the benefits of it being protective" — both in terms of developing colorectal cancer and surviving it. And while exercise is beneficial at any age, the younger you start the better.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We do think that exercise, starting in childhood and adolescence, also seems to be very important for protecting against a future risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult," Ng says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Guidelines from the&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html#:~:text=Most%20children%20and%20young%20adults,should%20be%20limited%20at%20home." target="_blank"&gt; American Cancer Society recommend&lt;/a&gt; people get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week to reduce the risk of cancer. But if that seems like more exercise than you have the time or energy for, something is always better than nothing, Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you are able to do 90 minutes more than you're currently doing, then that is a win," Schmitz says. "If you're able to do 60 minutes more than what you're currently doing, that is a win. Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Getting off the couch to begin with is a win."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s cuts to staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to clinical trials now threaten to unwind that progress, affected CDC researchers and outside HIV experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/"&gt;“reductions in force” last week at the CDC&lt;/a&gt; gutted branches responsible for a slew of prevention services: Expert guidance on preventing infant infections, a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/launch-of-together-takemehome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;at-home testing program&lt;/a&gt;, long-running &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv-data/mmp/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; to follow people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/launch-of-together-takemehome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;living with and at risk&lt;/a&gt; for HIV, statistical analysis to estimate national HIV incidence, and guidelines on how to use HIV prevention drugs or PrEP, including a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/04/01/trump-cuts-pepfar-threatens-rollout-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/"&gt;powerful new medicine&lt;/a&gt; likely to be approved this summer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT has also learned that funds have been suspended for the HIV Prevention Trials Network and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, the two most prominent networks for testing prevention drugs and vaccines. Funds have also been suspended for the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, a nearly 40-year-old system that has been responsible for key breakthroughs dating back to the first effective AIDS drug, AZT. All three have been waiting on money that were supposed to be sent out in February. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HPTN paused a study testing four interventions to prevent HIV in Black men who have sex with men in the South, a particularly vulnerable group. The ACTG paused enrollment for all of its studies except one for lack of funds, said Joe Eron, the group’s chair. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The one spared study has now also been paused for other reasons, Eron said, meaning the network is now essentially in a holding pattern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous reports also noted that funding was canceled last month for an adolescent trial system that has been active since 2001. Smaller grants for perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00969-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of other smaller HIV studies were also cut, seemingly because many focused on people of color, men who have sex with men, or transgender individuals. Cancellation letters reportedly argued such studies were examples of “DEI,” or diversity, equity, and inclusion, and “often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.” Researchers counter that such groups are the most at risk for HIV or the most medically underserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HHS Office of Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS Policy has also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00969-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; been slashed. The cuts of people and funds are collectively stoking deep alarm among HIV researchers and doctors across the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing can only be summarized by the words chaos and terror,” said Colleen Kelley, chair of the HIV Medicine Association. “Our terror is that we’re going to see increases in HIV infections, increases in deaths from AIDS, increases in babies being born with HIV.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact toll to date is difficult to quantify. So far, core federal programs to provide HIV treatment, including through the 1990 Ryan White CARE Act, appear intact. So does Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S., or EHE, the ambitious program Trump launched during his first administration. But the cuts, along with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/medicaid-cuts-republicans-paragon-say-to-focus-on-waste-fraud-and-abuse/"&gt;Republican-floated plans to slash Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;, have physicians and advocates concerned more is to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also come alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/trump-administration-sued-decision-rescind-billions-covid-19-public-health-funding/"&gt;attempt to claw back Covid recovery funds&lt;/a&gt;, a move that — while &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/03/federal-judge-temporarily-block-billions-health-funding-cuts-states/"&gt;currently blocked by a court order&lt;/a&gt; — has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/02/cdc-hhs-cuts-nyc-infectious-disease/"&gt;imperiled&lt;/a&gt; jobs at local public health departments, potentially impeding services to those living with or at risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we can keep our heads in the sand any longer,” said Anu Hazra, director of STI services for the Chicago Center of HIV Elimination. “Nothing is safe in this administration, whether treatment or care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not directly respond to a list of detailed questions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking a careful look at all divisions to see where there is overlap that could be streamlined to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure the federal government,” spokesperson Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano wrote. “This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The cuts to HIV work struck many researchers as darkly ironic, given the first Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/05/can-the-us-end-the-hiv-epidemic-in-a-decade-as-trump-pledged/"&gt;goal of ending the epidemic by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. Although not on track for that lofty ambition, EHE helped reduce infections by 12% as of 2021, by flooding resources into high-risk counties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was working,” said John Brooks, who served as chief medical officer for the CDC’s division of HIV prevention until last year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact toll of last Tuesday’s cuts was never announced, but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;branches of the CDC’s HIV prevention division appear to have been effectively eliminated, according to more than a half dozen affected employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These cuts actually leave intact “the division’s core functions,” said Brooks. That includes the surveillance team that counts new cases, an outbreak response team, and a team responsible for administering funds to states.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lost, though, were a long list of critical support and research, former employees and outside experts said. That includes a prevention communication branch that conducts public awareness campaigns and outreach to providers, as well as a quantitative science branch that employed mathematical modelers, statisticians, and economists to estimate national HIV incidence, determine where best to deploy limited resources, and assist in laboratory studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear now whether the CDC has the expertise required to even estimate the size of the epidemic. “No more statisticians are there to support the national HIV incidence,” said one affected employee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gone, too, is a behavioral and clinical surveillance branch that has long conducted two surveys on people living with and people at risk of HIV. It provided key data on what people need to access and stay on treatment or prevention services. “Without this data, we will provide worse care,” said Gretchen Newman, director of the HIV clinic at Wayne State University in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since January, one affected employee told STAT, the staff had spent much of their time trying to comply with an executive order demanding they scrub references to transgender individuals from the data in order to assure the overall project could continue. “We were doing all this meticulous fine-tuning,” they said, “and now it’s for nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The employee pointed out, with exasperation, that such efforts aligned with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s focus on chronic disease. Much of the group’s recent work focused on preventing cancer and heart disease in adults growing older with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A roughly 40-to-50-person research branch that ran studies and mined health records to examine the best way to deploy new prevention tools, such as PrEP, was also cut. It included a decades-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235508/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that was abruptly terminated in February, without a clear plan for informing subjects, according to a source, as well as work on how to get new long-acting injectable drugs to Black women in the South, who are most at risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What’s being lost … is the expert staff to make sure we know what’s working best to prevent HIV,” said Brooks. “Whether federal dollars are reaching the right people and are working, if there are gaps where prevention services are needed and how to most strategically spend that money.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An affected research branch employee put it in starker terms. The agency “will no longer be able to track HIV prevention progress,” the employee said, noting their extensive efforts to understand how key tools are being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy had said the cuts would be strategic and that scientists would not be fired,” they added. This “is the opposite of what the administration claimed it aimed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research branch also ran a pilot program to ship out a million at-home HIV tests, giving many access to cheap, discreet, and fast diagnostics. And it included central efforts to reduce mother-to-child transmission, an effort that has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10387171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; spectacularly effective but not complete. Between 30 and 40 &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/151/5/e2022059604/191071/Achieving-Elimination-of-Perinatal-HIV-in-the?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt; still contract HIV every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we still have perinatal transmission is a travesty,” said Carlos Del Rio, co-director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research. The CDC experts “were following every case, figuring out why and what we can do to [prevent] future cases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The status of all of these programs remains unclear. They have not, seemingly, been formally defunded. But it’s not clear who would now administer them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NBC News reported on a plan &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-considers-plan-eliminate-cdcs-hiv-prevention-divi-rcna196946" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;floated&lt;/a&gt; to move some prevention work into the Health Resources and Services Administration, which has long administered the Ryan White program for treatment. And a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/04/hiv-trump-cuts-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Washington Post that some efforts would be moved into a proposed new agency, Administration for a Healthy America. But no specifics have been offered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the government wants to try to be more efficient, that’s fine, said Mitch Warren, head of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, “but how are you making sure the programs continue? They haven’t said a word about that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, doctors and advocates are most concerned about prevention. Although the epidemic is far less deadly than it once was, its impact has remained remarkably unequal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It continues to have a disproportionate impact on young Black and Latino gay men, as well as transgender women, among other groups. That’s in part been driven by disparate access to tools such as PrEP. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the underserved community … we are experiencing an epidemic of HIV that has never really stopped,” said Dial Hewlett, a medical director at the Westchester County Department of Health. “Less than 40% of eligible adults are receiving PrEP. In underserved communities, less than 10% are receiving PrEP.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EHE program had provided resources to 57 of the nation’s highest-risk jurisdictions, in part to fund such efforts. And in June, regulators are also expected to approve &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/04/01/trump-cuts-pepfar-threatens-rollout-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/"&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt;, a new form of PrEP that has been shown to offer virtually complete protection from HIV with just a single administration every six months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC researchers had been preparing guidance for how clinicians should deploy the drug. That team is now essentially gone. Their departures and the cuts elsewhere have researchers concerned the new drug could be deployed as unevenly as the last.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” said &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/profile/?u=JCOLASA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jonathan Colasanti,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease researcher at Emory. “It has the potential to end the epidemic if we do it right, if the resources are there. Only if it reaches the people who need it the most.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pending Supreme Court decision could also unwind rules, imposed by the Biden administration, requiring insurers to cover PrEP. Even if coverage continues, uptake could be restricted if the CDC or government-funded entities aren’t allowed to direct efforts toward specific groups, such as transgender people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These moves have disappointed and angered researchers, who saw the focus on HIV as a rare medical bright spot from Trump’s first term. Some wonder if the decisions could be driven in part by Kennedy’s past &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-campaign-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; denying that HIV causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also say that it is, from a financial standpoint, remarkably inefficient. Treatment is far more expensive. The CDC estimated it saved $5 billion by averting 9,000 infections between 2017 and 2021. Researchers had hoped tools like lenacapavir and continued funding could avert thousands more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It baffles me and disappoints and upsets me,” Del Rio said of the blows to the HIV prevention infrastructure, “because we could end the HIV epidemic in our country if we do the right things.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's normal to experience changes in our mobility as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find movements like touching their toes or getting up from the sofa start to feel more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to offset this is through regular movement. But which exercises are the most effective for maintaining strength and mobility as you age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rachel Lennon, Pilates instructor and founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Wellness Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, there's one simple move that everyone should do for longevity: the glute bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bridge is such a good exercise for spinal mobility and core activation and strength and it also works the glutes," Lennon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part? It doesn't require any equipment, making it easy to do at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-glute-bridge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the glute bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with your feet flat on the floor and your heels close to your glutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press your lower back into the mat to find a neutral position in your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale then press through your heels to lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale, slowly lower your hips back to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat for 10-12 repetitions, finishing with a 30-second hold at the top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-glute-bridge-for-longevity"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of glute bridge for longevity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glute bridge offers several benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hBBVcjyXwfmFQzb97MzphZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hBBVcjyXwfmFQzb97MzphZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improves spinal mobility &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to stay feeling healthy and young, you want to keep the spine mobile," Lennon advises. "Moving up and down through this movement will mobilize the spine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthens the glutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The glutes are the biggest muscle in the body so we want to be working them regularly," Lennon explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Builds core strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 30-second hold will really engage your muscles, particularly your core," Lennon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong core is essential for supporting your entire body and providing strength for everyday movements like putting shopping away overhead and carrying heavy bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a stronger core can also help you maintain an upright posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to make this movement feel like fun. "Put some music on and do your reps to the beat," suggests Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making movement uplifting and lighthearted is important to ensure you develop a healthy relationship with exercise, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For some patients, the amount of blackened tissue that needs removing is so extreme it’s impossible and they die within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Mucorales, the fungal family which causes Mucormycosis, is not one considered ‘critical’ by WHO ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four invasive fungal pathogens deemed ‘critical’ on the list, and their insidious spores can even be found in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, “Candida albicans”, can be found “in about half the population inside our guts,” says Dr Rebecca Drummond, Associate Professor in antifungal immunity, University of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus, another critical priority pathogen, is in fact so widespread that most people inhale between 100 to 1000 spores every day from the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the mould on bread can contain Mucor, a fungus that causes Mucormycosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The invasive fungal infection making lungs bleed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if these threats are so prevalent, why don’t we hear about them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say it’s because those most at risk to fungal pathogens are people with weak immune systems, like patients living with HIV or on chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most fungal infections attack people who’ve already got existing illnesses, so they’ve either got weakened immune systems or they’ve got problems with their lungs” Prof Armstrong-James says. “Because they don’t strike down the man or woman in the street, so to speak, they don’t enter into the public folklore in the same way that viruses and bacteria do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medical interventions have improved – think of advances in chemotherapy that have enabled a much greater number of cancers to be treated – there are now more people living with compromised immune systems who are vulnerable to deadly spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace*, 66, has long suffered from severe asthma. Just over 10 years ago, she was diagnosed with Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis, a lung-damaging, life-threatening, condition caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus – another of the WHO’s priority pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I’d get my children to do back patting exercises to try and loosen [the mucus], I’d be on the floor over the cushions trying to be a bit upside down.’ Scans finally revealed the extent of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of [the doctors] said: ‘We know it’s not cancer, because [with] the amount of patches you’ve got, you wouldn’t be here,” she said, referring to the dark blotches of lung damage visible by x-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocktails of antifungal drugs made her hair fall out and damaged her liver function.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Atkinson, Treated's clinical lead, said: 'It's possible we've seen obesity hit its peak, and the number of people falling out of obesity will begin to overtake the number of people entering this BMI bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could have a profound effect on preventing type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-29345340-0e46-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. It could also help prevent hundreds of thousands of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-2933de10-0e46-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease cases annually.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity is a chronic condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat that raises the risk of a multitude of health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have warned that it can negatively impact someone's mental health, with people with the condition more likely to be depressed, suffer from poor body image or from stigma and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the report, researchers analyzed data from Treated — which prescribes weight loss drugs like Ozempic in the US and in 10 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The countries include Denmark, Estonia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-b1ab9960-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-b1abe780-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/the-netherlands/index.html" id="mol-b1acd1e0-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, Norway, Portugal, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/romania/index.html" id="mol-b1ad6e20-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/sweden/index.html" id="mol-b1adbc40-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from national public databases on prescription rates for the drugs was also used in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, researchers estimated that by the start of 2026 at least 2.86million Americans will be actively using a weight loss drug (either Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound or Mounjaro). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If this rate stays consistent, then they estimated the US could see 2.17million people fall out of the obese population each year between 2026 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the trend persists, by 2030, researchers estimated 10million people could reverse their obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Europe, for comparison, they estimated that by 2026 some 994,000 people on the continent would be using a weight loss drug — less than half the number in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People in southern states were more likely to be obese due to high prevalence of chronic disease and lack of access to healthy foods and recreational centers, researchers said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If this stays consistent, this would lead to 786,000 people reversing their obesity every year — or 1.3 percent of the obese population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of 2030, they estimated this could lead to 3.93million Europeans exiting obesity, or a drop of 6.6 percent in the continent's rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not account for other factors, however, such as the fact that studies suggest almost two thirds of patients regain the weight they lost after coming off Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joseph Palumbo, senior medical adviser for Treated, said: 'Knowing that obesity is a foundation of so many diseases, acute and chronic, I have been very excited and encouraged with these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We truly have a tool along with dietary modifications and exercise to combat obesity without drastic life-altering surgical options.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People on Ozempic or similar weight loss drugs inject themselves once a week, with the medication curbing appetite, leading to people eating less and shedding weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uptake of weight loss drugs is already high in the US, with about 13 percent of adults — or 33million people — estimated to have ever tried at least one by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no clear public figures for how many people in the US are currently taking a weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, in Denmark — the European country where the drugs were invented — just 1.5 percent of adults are estimated to have used the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the breakthrough in obesity medications, however, these drugs have been associated with undesirable side-effects — with many patients complaining of nausea, vomiting and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more serious cases, patients have said they've suffered from pancreatitis — inflammation of the pancreas — stomach paralysis, and even blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several deaths have also been reported in people taking the drug, although it was not clear whether the drug directly led to the fatality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 02:37:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPMF8zNmJZeDdwNFlBazhsd0RMYTREQW4tbzNfdV94aUJGSGg5a3pKdXNfSWZYeUZfZHdrYkNldVlMRTNRRFB2a1djNlItR2NBMmEyc29UcVRtb1RQYlM0SEFtYnhzampDVHFBSVpNeElab0NfZXFGb2FjbXVvWVFCTi1wZHNPQXY2REJLdmZrLTJXVjQzU3BMZkJB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1XRHhrQXJfcmd5WWlDQkxzLXJrMTVlcTRCUmNGVXR0UHZXMGxmeG5mM094VHAxMWd3YVptVXVVRUt6VnViSjdtS1FQS3FSZFd5bzBta1hnUW9Gb09VT0pPV0M5Yy12TXdjb3cteU5nVWNTTU11STNDRmRQaXVjYVV4bTVzaWp4SHh5anR5aUwyOFhMdEMxZEtvY2o3U242cw</guid></item><item><title>I fix botched plastic surgeries for a living... here are the common procedures you should never get - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPQ05OSWNlSDFZTUx1TGhqS1JVNEpzM0pQd19oa3JEN25nUXFka0JXRi04ZmFZdVlkZ1Q4MVJuOWotRmlYbTdmMHRYeC1xSkQ5NWd2a3NzNGl1SlJrSy1yWkdQZTZGVjQzUXdOYzBBM2dYcGhybU41RTBndE5YS25IXzB0dzFJQnYyVTdrMTdYZmFvTmctQ0xUMl9B0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5rRFRQd3VFcHJ0UUhVY3FDZzVRTE1GeHc3SEZOb2RZeE9xX2M2NGdkNndHNThrczd0aTJoaTM2cEstQTUxVXpXa0puNHdlemNDWlF6R2ZZMGhMUTJYTEpQN0FkUlJtOHpLVGNEVVBYMnROZU9MSC1jRV8tVTRUU1l2cHJVUmZfUVctVUIwY0ZvLWF4NFRKeFcwc3dCNy1OVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor who specializes in fixing botched plastic surgery procedures has revealed how to avoid being maimed under the knife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Timothy Katzen has handled hundreds of patients over his more than 25 years of practice, including a number who were victims of 'botched' operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of these were seeking a revision after a procedure, like a nose job that resulted in proportions they didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in other cases, patients were left with gaping wounds that reopened and became infected, sagging skin that rippled and — in rare cases — holes in their buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgery is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14448157/plastic-surgeon-daddy-transformations-surgery-craze.html"&gt; surging in popularity&lt;/a&gt; in the US as more people seek cosmetic enhancements amid the rise of Instagram filters and celebrity 'tweakments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 1.5million cosmetic procedures were carried out in the US — among the highest ever recorded and up five percent from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/liposuction/index.html" id="mol-ef740940-0c0e-11f0-b768-6d91f69217a5" class=""&gt;liposuction&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular — with 347,000 patients — followed by breast augmentation — at 304,000 — and tummy tuck — at 170,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Timothy Katzen, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, has increasingly helped patients whose plastic surgeries have been botched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of surgeries are carried out by well-trained surgeons and are completed without issue, with excellent natural-looking results for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in uncommon cases, patients can end up with complications — although this accounts for less than one percent of all US patients, estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said: 'Although it is very, very rare, you can have a complication with any procedure you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may not be the fault of the patient, and it may not be the fault of the surgeon — but complications do happen even when we try our best. Sometimes, things just don't heal right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the Beverly-Hills based doctor revealed the most common botched procedures that he fixes, as well as his top tips for avoiding becoming a botched patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Be aware of the most commonly botched surgeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Katzen said he sees the most complications from silicone injections, with an average 10 to 15 people per week seeking his help to reverse lumps, bumps and infections caused by the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can get the injections to enhance or reshape certain body parts by adding volume, smoothing wrinkles or contouring areas like the lips, buttocks, hips or face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these are illegal in the US, with the FDA saying they come with a risk of 'serious injury and disfigurement' that can happen weeks to months to even years after the injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karzen helps people with silicone injections by removing the silicone from their bodies, and also clearing up any scar tissue surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who had America's most common surgery liposuction were the next most common at his practice, with Dr Katzen saying he sees about five patients with complications from this procedure in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, they were struggling with loose or rippling skin, which was caused by too much fat being removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said they fix this by either injecting more fat into the area or by performing skin-tightening surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thigh lift, a procedure used to tighten skin around the legs, was the third most botched procedure the surgeon said, also with about five patients a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, he said, the incisions from the surgery — running from the groin to the knee — had opened, sometimes completely, and caused an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also mentioned a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), a notoriously dangerous procedure because it involves injecting fat into the buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, some of these fat cells may get into a blood vessel, in what is called a fat embolism, from which they can come to organs like the lungs and cause a blood clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeries normally have no complications if they are carried out by a trained and experienced surgeon.

Go for the surgeon you feel is the most experienced in your procedure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised not following the recommendations of friends, saying they may have had a different type of procedure or have a different body type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid illegal procedures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients have turned to illegal silicone injections from illicit surgeons and are now having to have it removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone is a synthetic substance that is used in implants for its soft texture that mimics the feel of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the FDA has banned it being injected into patients except in very rare procedures because of the high risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said he has seen many patients suffering from silicone complications, including many referred to him by other surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In past cases, he has had people who had swollen penises due to the injections or buttocks where holes had opened up in them due to the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Know what surgeries to skip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said&lt;span&gt; nearly all surgeries can provide excellent results, as long as they are carried out by a well-trained and experienced surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he did say there was one procedure, which he has only seen online, he would avoid. The operation is a facelift-like surgery in which a patient's skin is sewn together on the cheeks to give them a face-lift-like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This differs from a normal facelift, where incisions are made in front of the ears or a brow lift, where they are made along the hairline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's making people look like pincushions,' he said, 'I wouldn't recommend that one'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wasn't clear on the name of the procedure, but said it differed from a thread lift — which has been approved by the FDA for skin lifting and tightening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen added: 'But the rest are legitimate, and are good in experienced hands. Most of the time the ones who get botched procedures have not been with surgeons who have proper training or who haven't done it before and are inexperienced.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;The safest surgery REVEALED &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asked if there were any surgeries that rarely cause complications, Dr Katzen said complications appeared to be lowest with hair transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We see a lot of the body lift, tummy tuck over the hip, and others that are botched — where they've maybe taken out too much or too little skin,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But one of the safer surgeries, I would say, is actually hair transplants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With each hair transplant we do it on the back of the head, in a place where it isn't going to be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then, with the transplant itself, if we lose a couple of hairs, that is ok, that is part of the accepted risk.

Sometimes, things just don't heal right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the Beverly-Hills based doctor revealed the most common botched procedures that he fixes, as well as his top tips for avoiding becoming a botched patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Be aware of the most commonly botched surgeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Katzen said he sees the most complications from silicone injections, with an average 10 to 15 people per week seeking his help to reverse lumps, bumps and infections caused by the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can get the injections to enhance or reshape certain body parts by adding volume, smoothing wrinkles or contouring areas like the lips, buttocks, hips or face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these are illegal in the US, with the FDA saying they come with a risk of 'serious injury and disfigurement' that can happen weeks to months to even years after the injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karzen helps people with silicone injections by removing the silicone from their bodies, and also clearing up any scar tissue surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who had America's most common surgery liposuction were the next most common at his practice, with Dr Katzen saying he sees about five patients with complications from this procedure in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, they were struggling with loose or rippling skin, which was caused by too much fat being removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said they fix this by either injecting more fat into the area or by performing skin-tightening surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thigh lift, a procedure used to tighten skin around the legs, was the third most botched procedure the surgeon said, also with about five patients a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, he said, the incisions from the surgery — running from the groin to the knee — had opened, sometimes completely, and caused an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also mentioned a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), a notoriously dangerous procedure because it involves injecting fat into the buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, some of these fat cells may get into a blood vessel, in what is called a fat embolism, from which they can come to organs like the lungs and cause a blood clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeries normally have no complications if they are carried out by a trained and experienced surgeon.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation isn’t anyone’s ideal state of digestive affairs. The bloating, distension and overall discomfort of a gastrointestinal slow-down are a combo you’d probably prefer to skip. But for most of us, being backed up is an occasional fact of life (sometimes even a chronic one). Constipation is so common, in fact, that about 16% of U.S. adults say it’s a problem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, certain dietary supplements can help get things moving again. Though they may not work immediately, with a little patience, the right choices may make you feel lighter and brighter sooner than later. We tapped&lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist with Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology, a division of Allied Digestive Health, for her top supplement recommendations for constipation. She says the following five are worth a try.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-psyllium-husk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Psyllium Husk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With its surging popularity on social media, psyllium husk may seem like a buzzy modern supplement. But it’s been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a natural remedy for constipation for thousands of years. What makes it so effective? Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber, which creates a slick, gel-like substance in the digestive tract that retains water. This, in turn, makes your poops easier to pass, Shukla says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides psyllium’s ability to hold water, research reveals that it may also get things going by positively impacting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the trillions of bacteria that regulate a healthy digestive tract. For instance, one small study found that supplementing with psyllium husk for four weeks led to beneficial changes in the gut microbiota of people with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And another older study reported similar improvements in as little as one week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just note that psyllium husk can cause side effects in some people. (Shukla says a feeling of bloating is especially common.) You may want to start with a small dose to test your tolerance gradually. Also good to know: while supplements containing insoluble fiber may claim to ease constipation, they can actually make things worse. So, stick with soluble fiber-containing psyllium instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-probiotics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By now, you’ve probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. These beneficial, live bacteria may be an inexpensive, over-the-counter means of maintaining a happy gut. Here’s a tip, though: don’t just choose any old strain you see. Current research shows that certain probiotic strains may be more helpful than others for specific health issues, including constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One that has a solid track record is&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus reuteri.&lt;/em&gt; It works by getting your gut moving, helping you go more often.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, look for this strain specifically, or ask your doctor if another strain might be right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium-oxide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Magnesium Oxide &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is often touted as a constipation preventer. However, with so many forms of this mineral on supplement shelves, it can be hard to distinguish which one is best. Shukla recommends magnesium oxide. Like psyllium husk, she says magnesium oxide draws more water into the stool, keeping things nice and soft to help with easier evacuation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This form of magnesium may be particularly useful for treating chronic constipation that doesn’t have a known cause (also known as idiopathic constipation). In fact, the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology recently released new guidelines recommending magnesium oxide as a pharmacological treatment for idiopathic constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But don’t be put off by the “pharmacological” terminology—magnesium oxide is available over the counter.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla says you can find magnesium oxide in different strengths. “I usually recommend starting at 200 or 250 milligrams [per day] and increasing to a maximum of 1,000 milligrams per day.” She also notes that people with decreased kidney function should avoid taking magnesium, as it can build to dangerous levels if the kidneys are unable to filter it properly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-polyethylene-glycol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Polyethylene Glycol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Never heard of polyethylene glycol? You may have seen it in dietary supplements without realizing it’s there. This compound is the active ingredient in powdered supplements like MiraLax and its generic equivalents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla recommends polyethylene glycol for its ease of use and effectiveness in alleviating constipation. “It is tasteless and odorless and therefore well tolerated,” she says. “Its absorption from the gut is negligible, making it a safe and effective option for treating constipation.” And unlike over-the-counter laxatives that should only be used occasionally, it’s safe for longer-term use. For instance, one study found that polyethylene glycol was safe and effective in reducing the frequency of hard or lumpy stools in people with chronic idiopathic constipation over the course of 24 weeks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-prunes-and-prune-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Prunes and Prune Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out, Grandma was onto something. While not a supplement per se, the old &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-to-help-you-poop-8649695" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prune juice remedy&lt;/a&gt; really is a smart move for getting regular again. And there’s research to prove it. For instance, one study found that people with chronic constipation who drank slightly less than 2 ounces of prune juice daily for eight weeks experienced significantly fewer hard or lumpy stools.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it food as medicine for the win!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prunes have high dietary fiber and sorbitol, both helpful for treating constipation,” explains Shukla. “This contributes to increased stool bulk and improved bowel movements.” Just one-quarter cup of prunes (about 5 prunes) provides 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Sorbitol, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that offers some surprising benefits for digestive health. “Sorbitol has osmotic properties that draw water into the intestines, keeping stool soft and easy to expel,” says Shukla. In fact, some people with quick intestinal transit actually &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; sorbitol for this reason. So, if you want to give prunes or prune juice a try, start slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your digestive tract gets a bit sluggish, a healthy diet, proper hydration and exercise should be your first lines of defense. When they aren’t enough, the supplement aisle has safe, effective options for constipation relief. Psyllium husk, probiotics, magnesium oxidize and polyethylene glycol are all gastroenterologist-approved supplements for constipation relief. And if you’d prefer a more natural remedy, give prunes or prune juice a try. They may not be trendy, but they work!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. said Sunday that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” his &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most direct statement yet&lt;/a&gt; on the issue, following the death of a second child of the condition in the outbreak in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has long described the vaccine as dangerous, has largely avoided endorsing its use since the start of the outbreak, and he stopped short of explicitly saying he “recommended” it in his latest remarks, as public health officials have called on him to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours later, Kennedy promoted unorthodox, unproven treatments for the disease in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;. He spent time with “extraordinary healers,” he said — doctors Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards — who had treated children with measles with aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those drugs, a steroid and antibiotic, respectively, are &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/03/the-measles-vaccine-is-our-best-tool-to-protect-individuals-against-the-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not proven&lt;/a&gt; measles treatments, physicians and health experts have said after Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;previously promoted them&lt;/a&gt;. Budesonide may even weaken the immune system, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less than a month ago, Kennedy said — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/14/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-death-claims-scientists-disagree/"&gt;against current evidence&lt;/a&gt; — that the measles shot caused deaths every year. At the time, he pointed to the importance of nutrition and personal choice in getting the shot, even as he &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in West Texas has continued to grow and has also spread to Kansas and Oklahoma. The second fatality in West Texas — after an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;adult with measles died in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — came Thursday, prompting Kennedy to travel there in a show of support and to attend the girl’s funeral. He said while there he met with the family of the 8-year-old, Daisy, as well as the family of the first child to die in the outbreak, Kayley, 6. Neither girl had been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in his initial post on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s post did not mention nutrition, vitamin A as a treatment, or the importance of personal choice in getting the shot, as some of his earlier statements did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He instead said he would be redeploying a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Texas at the request of the state’s governor, Greg Abbott. Kennedy came to the state to learn how the Department of Health and Human Services can support the state’s efforts to contain the virus, he said, adding HHS would “follow Texas’ lead” in addressing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s comments come after years of sowing doubt about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, despite overwhelming evidence that contradicted his claims. Concerns that he would damage Americans’ health because of that history threatened to tank his Senate confirmation to the role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In making his case before the Senate, Kennedy promised to renew trust in health agencies before becoming the top health official in the country. But he’s now facing a growing outbreak of a disease that is being fueled in part by low vaccination rates as well as the persistence of misinformation, public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to Kennedy’s latest post, the anti-vaccine nonprofit he led before taking charge of HHS, Children’s Health Defense, was characterizing the measles vaccine as dangerous on its website. Responses to Kennedy’s post on X included some users suggesting people shouldn’t get the shot and others arguing Kennedy’s post didn’t represent the movement he had long represented. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health experts&lt;a href="https://x.com/JReinerMD/status/1908976909771211142" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; praised Kennedy’s initial weekend statement&lt;/a&gt; that the measles vaccine is the most effective tool to stop the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Others said he needed to do more as the virus continues to spread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He needs to state plainly … that the MMR is safe, and that unvaccinated patients should receive it,” Michelle Au, a physician and Georgia politician, &lt;a href="https://x.com/AuforGA/status/1908982130694303811" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a response&lt;/a&gt; on X. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least one Senate Republican also wants stronger messaging for everyone getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;previously concerned&lt;/a&gt; about Kennedy’s ability to lead HHS, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1908903799701303633" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a post&lt;/a&gt; before Kennedy’s own statement. “Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

are being put in potentially life-threatening situations due to missed doses of prescription &lt;a href="/topic/medicines"&gt;medicines&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) found &lt;a href="/business/patients-not-receiving-timely-care-in-hospital-ambulance-workers-say-b2728232.html"&gt;people in A&amp;amp;E&lt;/a&gt; were not getting their medications on time and were &lt;a href="/news/health/corridor-care-job-ad-norovirus-b2705736.html"&gt;missing doses &lt;/a&gt;needed to manage their illnesses – putting them at risk of getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;Insulin&lt;/a&gt; for diabetes, &lt;a href="/topic/parkinsons"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; drugs, epilepsy &lt;a href="/news/health/asthma-breathing-difficulty-hospital-b2716631.html"&gt;medicines and tablets&lt;/a&gt; for preventing blood clots are all time critical medicines (TCM). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these drugs are delayed or missed, the patient can deteriorate and is at greater risk of complications or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While patients are advised to remember to bring their medications to A&amp;amp;E and to take them, there is also a responsibility on &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; staff to make sure this happens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 iKgUrB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Diabetes UK s aid delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-211378"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Diabetes UK s aid delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the recognised risk of harm, the delivery of TCM is not consistent across &lt;a href="/topic/emergency-departments"&gt;emergency departments&lt;/a&gt; with long waiting times often contributing to this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on oral levodopa for Parkinson's and insulin for diabetes, as these are common in patients in A&amp;amp;E and must be given on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from 136 emergency departments in the UK which submitted data for more than 13,000 people in A&amp;amp;E who were on insulin injections or levodopa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was part of the College's clinical Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) which aims to improve the care of A&amp;amp;E patients, found more than half of these patients were not identified as being on TCM within 30 minutes of their arrival in an emergency department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, 68 per cent of doses were not administered within 30 minutes of the expected time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings contained in this report should serve as a call to action for both emergency medicine staff, as well as patients reliant on time critical medications, to ensure no dose is ever missed in A&amp;amp;E," said Dr Jonny Acheson, an emergency medicine consultant in Leicester who has Parkinson's, led the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that paramedics and emergency medicine staff need to ask patients what medications they take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, those with Parkinson's and insulin treated diabetes need to tell staff and take their medications with them if they visit an A&amp;amp;E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the NHS must think about how they identify people taking these types of medication and how they are able to ensure they receive their doses on time, every time while they are in the emergency department,” he added. "These medicines are critical to the quality of these patients lives and we have a duty of care to ensure that they receive them when they should." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations made by the QIP team include that patients on vital medications should be identified early when they attend A&amp;amp;E, to prevent any missed doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that systems need to be in place to ensure medication is given on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ian Higginson, RCEM president-elect, said that this a problem “we should not be having to fix” and suggested long waiting times are partly to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has risen to prominence because of the increasing number of our patients who are having to endure ridiculously long waits in our emergency departments - 12, 24, 48 hours and even longer,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that missing doses of medication for Parkinson's or diabetes is not just “inconvenient” it can be “dangerous” and have “serious consequences”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's UK praised the RCEM's work while &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes-uk"&gt;Diabetes UK&lt;/a&gt; said delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: "We welcome this report and will look closely at the findings, to ensure any patient in need of time critical medicine does not lose out when in A&amp;amp;E and receives the medication they need or support to self-administer as they would at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the report makes clear, it is welcome to see improvements thanks to the hard work of frontline staff but more generally we know A&amp;amp;E waiting times are far too long and our upcoming urgent and emergency care plan will set out how we aim to bring these down ahead of next winter." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 23:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUHByTXNaelFuTDFvb1d6SXhXTjlneTRtQzdXWmJzVTk5dnp2SFlObHlfbFdpb0l5SC0yVmJsaE9jOFRYS1YtRVM0TVRUanczQUh2WXhoRUM0anBDaXJkNVpfZE9JcmtlbGV2dEV2VVNhaFlKbGdMUXJ3VE1MYnRHV0poQ1NYNDg2cEZRSkhyT05mWEhFU0l2ZnctbjBaam1uQ2c4dW5OZncxRWt0R1E</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. visits epicenter of Texas measles outbreak after second child who was infected dies - PBS</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPbUN1T20tWVF0cVFzY1hKbEdHbG9nQWVRNC1qLTBvR0dUMHhpUGg3VWNTTW9nbHFUTmhid19HdUZWTVJNNUl6MUJQcHhiSTNOLXoxdGtEZ0xxdDk1S3BQMlVNb3dBbWlRZHRCT2dLamdSN0lvUkU0aHdwbjZhTVdpTktuOHhlVHF6UzQwQy1HbEIzdkl1U2NXX0xIZHItVEpNeWhUNVF6bFZFY2l1UDdtSFJrNE0xaUlqTDJpQVhCR2xpbnlmMk00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas’ still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/second-child-dies-from-measles-related-causes-in-west-texas-where-cases-approach-500"&gt;READ MORE: Second child dies from measles-related causes in West Texas, where cases approach 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to “control the outbreak” and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminole is the &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/"&gt;epicenter of the outbreak,&lt;/a&gt; which started in late January and continues to swell — with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second young child died Thursday from “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,” and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was “receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Kennedy’s first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he “developed bonds” with the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/mennonites-west-texans-at-center-of-measles-outbreak-choose-medical-freedom-over-vaccine-mandates"&gt;Mennonite community in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; in which the virus is mostly spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation’s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to “delay care” for a child who is sick with measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call your doctor and make sure you’re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC teams arrived in early March, Patel said. But Kennedy’s social media post noted that CDC employees have been “redeployed,” and the nation’s public health agency never relayed it had pulled back. Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy’s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1908903799701303633"&gt;in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,” he wrote. “Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a “personal one” and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People “should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors’ warnings that it should be given under a physician’s orders and that too much can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they’ve treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration’s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the epitome of an absolute needless death,” Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. “These kids should get vaccinated — that’s how you prevent people from dying of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn’t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease — and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide — some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by the University of Southampton has found that medications for ADHD have overall small effects on blood pressure and heart rate after weeks or a few months of use.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;There have been concerns about the side effects of ADHD medications but the new findings, coupled with other studies, suggest that the benefits of taking these medications outweigh the risks, while highlighting the need for careful monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00062-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, conducted the largest and most comprehensive analysis of the cardiovascular effects of ADHD medications based on the results of randomized controlled trials—the most rigorous type of clinical study to assess medication effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, senior lead author of the study from the University of Southampton said, "When it comes to taking any medication, risks and benefits should always be assessed together. We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that attention-deficit/&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hyperactivity+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD) affects around 4% of children in the UK. Of these, around 45% are treated with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medication/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The international team of investigators analyzed data from 102 randomized controlled trials, including a total of 22,702 participants with ADHD. They used an advanced statistical approach—network meta-analysis—that allowed them to compare the effects of several medications, even when the medications were not directly compared in the trials included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that all ADHD medications were generally associated with overall small effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters. With the exception of guanfacine (which leads to decreased blood pressure and heart rate), other medications led to increases in the values of these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No significant differences were found between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) with regard to their effects on blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings should inform future clinical guidelines, stressing the need to systematically monitor &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+rate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, both for stimulants and non-stimulants. This should be particularly relevant for practitioners who might assume that only stimulants have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system," said first author, Dr. Luis Farhat (University of São Paulo, Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that those with existing heart conditions should discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Co-senior author, Professor Alexis Revet (University of Toulouse, France) added, "Our findings, based on randomized controlled trials that tend to be of short duration due to ethical issues, should be complemented by results from real-world, longer-term studies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team will now look to see if some groups might be more vulnerable to cardiovascular side effects than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIHR Research Professor Cortese concluded, "While our findings are informative at the group level, that is, on average, we cannot exclude that a subgroup of individuals may have a higher risk of more substantial cardiovascular alterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While it is currently not possible to identify those individuals at higher risk, efforts based on precision medicine approaches will hopefully provide important insights in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Samuele Cortese, the senior lead author of the study, from the University of Southampton, said the risks and benefits of taking any medication had to be assessed together, but for ADHD drugs the risk-benefit ratio was “reassuring”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications,” he said. “Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 3 to 4% of adults and 5% of children in the UK are believed to have ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing, according to the National Institute for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Care Excellence (Nice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Doctors can prescribe stimulants, such as methylphenidate, of which the best-known brand is Ritalin. Other stimulant medications used to treat ADHD include lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine. Non-stimulant drugs include atomoxetine, an sNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and guanfacine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study of children, adolescents and adults states: “There is uncertainty regarding whether medications that are used for the treatment of ADHD may lead to cardiovascular diseases, and concerns remain around their cardiovascular safety.” It found all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/03/adhd-does-medication-work#:~:text=As%20with%20any%20drug%2C%20however,aggression%2C%20headaches%20and%20stomach%20problems." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ADHD medications&lt;/a&gt; were associated with small increases of blood pressure and heart rate, except guanfacine, which led to decreased blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There were no significant differences regarding the impact on blood pressure and heart rate between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine). The researchers advised people with existing heart conditions to discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, a consultant psychiatrist and expert on ADHD, said most clinicians prescribing ADHD medication understood the cardiovascular risks and followed Nice guidelines for monitoring blood pressure, pulse and weight. “We need more detailed guidelines for scenarios when ADHD medication needs to be adjusted or stopped,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year, a thinktank warned that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; was experiencing an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/04/nhs-faces-avalanche-of-demand-for-autism-and-adhd-services-thinktank-warns" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“avalanche of need”&lt;/a&gt; over autism and ADHD, and said the system in place to cope with surging demand for assessments and treatments was “obsolete”. The number of prescriptions issued in England for ADHD medication &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/11/adhd-prescriptions-in-england-have-risen-by-18-each-year-since-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has risen by 18% year on year &lt;/a&gt;since the pandemic, with the biggest rise in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Tony Lord, a former chief executive of the ADHD Foundation, said the long-term benefits of ADHD medication were well established, and included a reduced risk of anxiety and depression, eating disorders, harm from smoking, improved educational outcomes and economic independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sadly ignorance about ADHD medications persists – a throwback to the 80s and 90s when ADHD medications were mistakenly viewed as a morality pill that made naughty, fidgety disruptive children behave – which of course it is not,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is simply a cognitive enhancer that improves information processing, inhibits distractions, improves focus, planning and prioritising, self monitoring and reduces impulsivity of thought and action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNZjRJTlpSS2UxV3YxVGlWUGNITzNDZkhJLVFfbjNWVjJxM2JqNDl6MTE3RjFUSnhIUEppNmRRazRsekJSN1BMaGtlZm9DNlMza25VWEx1czhOenB1TFllNklqS2RYQ1J4SXUzVEowTFRjaVl0YjdadkloRnZEbEhrejk1aWs5aHFGLVR1MXJXREdmVWlxcUJvZE1iZzc1TWEz</guid></item><item><title>FDA-approved sleeping pill offers new hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOZ1FnbGx3TFZPSHlQR1VzdHcxYmpUTWpPUWQ2cmpNZ3UzcWdlTGNQWllhU1JFX1Q5QVFOcjc1TzBibEN6MjJGdUdvblFEY0JuODE4a25FcE56TE8zNGZkZGpDcHpwSlhFLUd6UXlGNjcxN3c0TFoySnNZT2cwaWtLRThqaklKOHdqNmxSMUFiTzFVbzBBU1A1SXNxMVg4U3lGb1EwNWsxd0RHRTlteS11YWFOS0dVV2VfNDVyRFZYOTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is notorious for robbing individuals of memory and cognitive function. Researchers have struggled for decades to find effective treatments, yet none have successfully halted or reversed the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, points to an unexpected solution: a medication commonly used to help people sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists recently discovered that a sleeping pill, already FDA-approved to treat insomnia, can temporarily reduce harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer's. The drug, known as suvorexant, targets the protein build-up that characterizes Alzheimer's, potentially slowing its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery adds weight to the growing understanding that sleep is critical in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/natural-dietary-supplement-proven-effective-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer's prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Poor sleep can contribute to the disease’s early development, causing harmful proteins to accumulate in the brain. Better sleep might help clear these proteins, offering hope for prevention or delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on unphosphorylated tau (i.e., total tau).

Trouble sleeping can serve as an early warning sign, showing up years before memory loss. Poor sleep quality raises levels of two critical proteins—amyloid-beta and tau—in the brain. These proteins build up into plaques and tangles, eventually causing neurons to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found a direct link between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-connect-sleep-habits-to-mortality-rate-study-finds/"&gt;disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of amyloid-beta and tau. Even one night of poor sleep can cause amyloid-beta to spike, speeding its accumulation. Better sleep quality might flush out these harmful proteins, slowing Alzheimer's disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, treating sleep issues isn't as straightforward as taking any sleeping pill. Most sleep medications help people fall asleep quickly but may limit the deeper, restorative sleep phases. These phases are crucial to clearing harmful brain proteins. Thus, finding a medication that truly enhances sleep quality is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="suvorexant_more_than_just_a_sleep_aid_"&gt;Suvorexant: More Than Just a Sleep Aid?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small but compelling study led by Dr. Brendan Lucey at &lt;a href="https://sleep.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, scientists explored how suvorexant affects Alzheimer's-linked proteins. Suvorexant belongs to a new class of sleep medications called dual orexin receptor antagonists. Orexin is a molecule that promotes wakefulness; suvorexant blocks it, promoting deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 38 healthy adults, ages 45 to 65, without sleep problems or signs of cognitive impairment. Participants spent two nights at a sleep clinic, receiving either suvorexant or a placebo pill. Researchers collected cerebrospinal fluid—a clear liquid surrounding the brain—every two hours through a small tube placed in participants' lower backs. This fluid carries waste away from the brain, including amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, after just one dose of suvorexant, amyloid-beta levels dropped by 10% to 20%, compared to the placebo. A higher dose (20 mg, typically prescribed for insomnia) also lowered a particular form of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-new-study-identifies-key-protein-driving-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorylated tau, by about 10% to 15%. Phosphorylated tau is crucial because it directly forms harmful tangles that destroy brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on phosphorylated tau/unphosphorylated tau ratio.

"If you can reduce tau phosphorylation, potentially there would be less tangle formation and less neuronal death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the benefits were temporary. Tau protein levels returned to normal within 24 hours after taking suvorexant. However, repeated nightly doses might keep &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-proteins-repair-heart-muscle-and-regenerate-organs/"&gt;harmful proteins&lt;/a&gt; at consistently lower levels. Dr. Lucey emphasized caution, though: "It would be premature for people who are worried about developing Alzheimer's to interpret it as a reason to start taking suvorexant every night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="limitations_and_future_directions"&gt;Limitations and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging results, researchers urge caution. This initial study was brief, involving only two nights and a small group. It did not assess the long-term impacts of taking suvorexant regularly, nor did it test older adults at higher risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still aren't certain whether lowering &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/new-study-finds-that-alzheimers-can-be-passed-from-one-person-to-another/"&gt;amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt; and tau temporarily will prevent Alzheimer's altogether. Previous studies have questioned the idea that reducing these proteins is enough to stop or slow the disease. Many treatments that successfully reduce amyloid-beta have failed to improve memory or cognitive symptoms in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Dr. Lucey remains hopeful. He believes future studies, lasting months rather than days, might reveal more lasting effects. His team plans to test suvorexant in older adults already showing early amyloid buildup but not yet experiencing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not quite there yet," he admitted. "I'm hopeful that we will eventually develop drugs that take advantage of the link between sleep and Alzheimer's to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia-and-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="should_you_consider_sleeping_pills_"&gt;Should You Consider Sleeping Pills?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While promising, these findings don't mean everyone should reach for suvorexant to protect against Alzheimer's. Long-term use of sleeping pills can lead to dependence, reduced effectiveness, and other health risks. They might even negatively impact sleep quality over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on amyloid-β (Aβ).

Dr. Lucey stresses the importance of improving sleep naturally, advising individuals concerned about Alzheimer’s to consult a sleep specialist rather than relying solely on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this research highlights the intriguing potential of sleep as a powerful preventive measure against Alzheimer's. If future studies confirm that deep, restful sleep can protect the brain from harmful proteins, sleep-based therapies could become a central approach to preventing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Lucey puts it, better sleep "is a sensible approach to improving general brain health at any age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="suvorexant_a_brief_history_in_time"&gt;Suvorexant: A Brief History in Time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvorexant, marketed as Belsomra, is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved for the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/magnetic-pulses-aimed-at-the-brain-could-treat-insomnia-study-finds/"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by Merck &amp;amp; Co., Inc., the drug's journey began in the early 2000s, aiming to address the significant unmet need for effective insomnia treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput screening for orexin receptor antagonists commenced in 2005, leading to the discovery and subsequent approval of suvorexant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvorexant functions by selectively inhibiting the orexin receptors OX₁ and OX₂, which play a crucial role in regulating wakefulness. By blocking these receptors, suvorexant diminishes the wake-promoting influence of orexin neuropeptides, thereby facilitating sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is distinct from traditional &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-research-reveals-the-surprising-global-impact-of-insomnia/"&gt;insomnia medications&lt;/a&gt; that typically enhance sleep-promoting signals via gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of suvorexant in improving both sleep onset and maintenance. In pooled analyses of three-month studies, patients receiving 20/15 mg of suvorexant experienced significant enhancements in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset compared to placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse effect being &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/somnolence-drowsiness#:~:text=Somnolence%2C%20also%20known%20as%20drowsiness,of%20several%20types%20of%20medications." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;somnolence&lt;/a&gt;, which was typically mild to moderate and occurred early in the treatment course. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="27" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond primary insomnia, suvorexant has shown promise in addressing sleep disturbances associated with various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="28" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Always consult your doctor or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, procedure, or treatment, whether it is a prescription medication, over-the-counter drug, vitamin, supplement, or herbal alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 22:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOZ1FnbGx3TFZPSHlQR1VzdHcxYmpUTWpPUWQ2cmpNZ3UzcWdlTGNQWllhU1JFX1Q5QVFOcjc1TzBibEN6MjJGdUdvblFEY0JuODE4a25FcE56TE8zNGZkZGpDcHpwSlhFLUd6UXlGNjcxN3c0TFoySnNZT2cwaWtLRThqaklKOHdqNmxSMUFiTzFVbzBBU1A1SXNxMVg4U3lGb1EwNWsxd0RHRTlteS11YWFOS0dVV2VfNDVyRFZYOTA</guid></item><item><title>'Misokinesia' Phenomenon Could Affect 1 in 3 People, Study Shows - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNU9UalI0dmxPSktXTGJiYk5VSDlVTWJPeWR1R3ZWRFE3ZENDMU1HbGNJdHUwXzVQdE1wODdhc3FGengzbHRrTmpRaHV3Nk5KNnNvbWdWMW5LOHM3LW1GdlN1eFBrRUM5c0wyQVkxc2daeEdlU25pY1BnNGVtTUd4QUVEYXdPNkVXU25xYmtiU05rYTZI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Noticing somebody fidgeting can be distracting. Vexing. Even excruciating. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research, the stressful sensations caused by seeing others fidget are an incredibly common psychological phenomenon, affecting as many as one in three people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.misokinesia.ca"&gt;misokinesia&lt;/a&gt; – meaning 'hatred of movements' – this strange phenomenon had been little studied by scientists until recent years, but was noted in the context of a related condition, &lt;a href="a-super-sensitive-brain-connection-could-be-why-some-people-can-t-stand-certain-sounds"&gt;misophonia&lt;/a&gt;: a disorder where people become &lt;a href="can-t-stand-the-sound-of-people-chewing-blame-your-brain-science-misophonia"&gt;irritated upon hearing certain repetitious sounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misokinesia is somewhat similar, but the triggers are generally more visual, rather than sound-related, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[Misokinesia] is defined as a strong negative affective or emotional response to the sight of someone else's small and repetitive movements, such as seeing someone mindlessly fidgeting with a hand or foot," a team of researchers, led by first author and psychologist Sumeet Jaswal, then at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;explained in a study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet surprisingly, scientific research on the topic is lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg" alt="hands fidgeting" class="wp-image-144167 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Misokenesia creates strong emotional responses on seeing small, repetitive movements. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding, Jawal and fellow researchers conducted what they said was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;"first in-depth scientific exploration"&lt;/a&gt; of misokinesia – and the results indicate that heightened sensitivity to fidgeting is something a large number of people have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a series of experiments involving over 4,100 participants, the researchers measured the prevalence of misokinesia in a cohort of university students and people from the general population, assessing the impacts it had upon them, and exploring why the sensations might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that approximately one-third self-reported some degree of misokinesia sensitivity to the repetitive, fidgeting behaviors of others as encountered in their daily lives," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results support the conclusion that misokinesia sensitivity is not a phenomenon restricted to clinical populations, but rather, is a basic and heretofore under-recognized social challenge shared by many in the wider, general population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the analysis, misokinesia sometimes goes hand in hand with the sound-sensitivity of misophonia, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon seems to vary significantly among individuals, with some people reporting only low sensitivity to fidgeting stimuli, while others feel highly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are negatively impacted emotionally and experience reactions such as anger, anxiety, or frustration as well as reduced enjoyment in social situations, work, and learning environments," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; UBC psychologist Todd Handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some even pursue fewer social activities because of the condition.".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handy began researching misokinesia after a partner told him he was a fidgeter and confessed she felt stress when he fidgeted (or anybody else for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a visual cognitive neuroscientist, this really piqued my interest to find out what is happening in the brain," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the million-dollar question stands: Why do we find fidgeting so annoying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers ran tests to see if people's misokinesia might originate in heightened visual-attentional sensitivities, amounting to an inability to block out distracting events occurring in their visual periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results based on early experiments were inconclusive on that front, with the researchers finding no firm evidence that reflexive visual attentional mechanisms substantively contribute to misokinesia sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're still only at the outset then of exploring where misokinesia may spring from on a cognitive level, the researchers do have some hypothetical leads for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One possibility we want to explore is that their '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt;' are at play," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These neurons activate when we move but they also activate when we see others move… For example, when you see someone get hurt, you may wince as well, as their pain is mirrored in your own brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extension, it's possible that misokinesia-prone people might be unconsciously empathizing with the psychology of fidgeters. And not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A reason that people fidget is because they're anxious or nervous so when individuals who suffer from misokinesia see someone fidgeting, they may mirror it and feel anxious or nervous as well," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether that's what's really going on here with misokinesia, only further research into the phenomenon will be able to say for sure. A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313169"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Jaswal in 2024 on 21 volunteers found the condition may be linked to challenges in disengaging from a stimulus, rather than about the initial distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though. From the results seen here, it's clear that this unusual phenomenon is much more usual than we realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To those who are suffering from misokinesia, you are not alone," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;. "Your challenge is common and it's real."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the expected out-of-pocket cost for a colonoscopy, based on a survey of 333,000 claims from 2014 to 2019, and the price some patients have been faced with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Screening reveals benign polyps that aren't cancer, but by removing them we are reducing the risk of cancer developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are putting off colonoscopies worrying about costs, then this means these aren't removed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned: &lt;span&gt;'If you put off screening and don't do anything, there's certainly a much higher probability that when you go in, you have symptoms,' which may raise the risk of being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer often causes no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But warning signs can include trouble using the bathroom, blood in feces and persistent diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors fear that, faced with the risk of high prices, patients may put off any screenings — which can find pre-cancerous growths and eliminate them, slashing the risk of developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also put off screenings even when they have symptoms, risking the cancer reaching an advanced stage — making it harder to treat and deadlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 67 percent of adults adhere to current screening requirements, below the US government target of at least 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a small business owner from Illinois was hit with a bill for $7,000 after getting a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tim Winard, 57, had no symptoms of the disease, but opted to get screened to 'do the right thing' and be on the safe side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had six-month short-term health insurance, which he took out while he worked on his business. He said his insurer told him he could get the cancer screening 'anywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to Endeavor Health Elmhurst Hospital outside Chicago and was in and out of the center the same day. Later, he was told his results were normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 have risen over the past two decades. This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But then his bill came. He was charged $7,000 after his insurance paid only $814.47 towards the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Confused, he contacted the insurance company and said a representative told him the insurance would not pay more because his procedure was 'out of network'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Winard then contacted the media, with his story first reported by &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/short-term-health-plan-surprise-billing-7k-colonoscopy-bill-of-the-month-march-2025/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20Daily%20Health%20Policy%20Report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gr0b1tETHRI7mC3lqoHKi1v9RlboX4o2d2mKTSy-hqDl8NcI-VwqhPROdgDzUJUcKSH1e_v-38iFqipcdiof9_FaAGdPE33YSsNKZlr8O9Sb4F0I&amp;amp;_hsmi=354058799&amp;amp;utm_content=354058799&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After they contacted the health insurer, he was issued a new bill for only $770 — with no explanation given for the shift in the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another case, Mike Meier from Georgia, who had health insurance through Alliant, went to get a colonoscopy after it was recommended by his doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The screening found a benign polyp on his colon and it was successfully removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But then he received the bill, totaling $10,745, prompting him to immediately contact his insurer and hospital — Aurora Health Care — to ask about the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through numerous complaints and appeals, it eventually emerged that his insurance company had misprinted his insurance card to suggest he had out-of-network coverage for more than just emergency care - when he actually did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the error, however, his insurer was still unwilling to pay because he had taken out an insurance plan with a $20,000 deductible. (Most plans have a deductible around $1,790).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act, healthcare plans are required to cover certain preventive services, including screenings for colon cancer in asymptomatic adults, for those who are 45 to 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mr Meier was short of that when he had the procedure, just a few months from his 45th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a third case, a patient on Reddit came forward two months ago to say they had a colonoscopy with an in-network doctor and was charged $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient, who was not named, said beforehand they had contacted their doctor and the billing office who said the procedure was covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tim Winard, 57, had no symptoms of the disease, but opted to get screened to 'do the right thing' and be on the safe side. Despite having health insurance, he was slapped with a $7,000 bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after receiving two denial letters, the patient had been billed, with the insurance saying the surgery center and anesthesiologist were out-of-network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colonoscopies are complex procedures, that often require a doctor to undertake them as well as an anesthesiologist to ensure a patient's comfort when deep sedation and general anesthesia are used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A breakdown of the costs was not revealed, but people commenting said the patient was likely being billed for their doctor, the surgery center and the anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The post was flooded with 236 comments from others who also said they had been charged outrageous amounts for colonoscopies or similar procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said that to get a colonoscopy at a lower price patients should always contact their insurer first to ensure the colonoscopy is in network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also recommended going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital, which tends to be cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2021.2015157"&gt; 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; that examined healthcare claims among 333,000 adults with average risk of colon cancer between 2014 and 2019 found that they paid, on average, $79 out-of-pocket for a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Misleading and confusing payment and coverage information has doctors worried because of the rapid surge in colon cancer cases, particularly among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 12 cases per 100,000 people under the age of 45 years were reported in 2021, data suggests, compared to less than six per 100,000 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:44:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQdVU2WDJnRkNzQnBhSmtaZ2Rka1FRbGJkd0xqTjJYUFpKMUpIRGNGb1VEYjc3dTVremc1WnczempjeHZVY1JacXhRUGxNOWRqc1JVQUdPbDZsNzZlOGJPZ0ZlR1NURzZVS2JtZE1yOVd5R1ZjRFJ6cWU0TkJjXzdnalY4dGsxa29kWDR2VXRmSDhSNEI3QUNFRnFheHM5ZnlwNGJ5Z1NxdV9hMVZRQUHSAbMBQVVfeXFMTVRHSFFGYnEyOE5udTU0dDFXakN0d0FIdnNaSDBmSjVFV05WRE9saHRxRjV5NzBaMWtRbExpOWtNQlVtUXdONV9OZ3liRTNwSGg2THpyU1pLNXlnbmw4bWVuUTRDQWdMTTRaNGhoTjJrc3o2OVNwbVc3RE5RUGlMeERaQ0xidGpOenIwTWVuYUt1TlZmbmJrMUhvNC1oTmlGZkJaNFdnTlpVTGcxeEJGbGV3WkE</guid></item><item><title>How does the human brain create and retrieve memories?

Some ideas revolve around chemical changes in specific neurons, while others focus on structural shifts among brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=tryan6"&gt;Dr. Tomás Ryan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Trinity College Dublin&lt;/a&gt; is among the neuroscientists who have explored these questions by tracking cells involved in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-isnt-only-stored-in-our-brains-other-cells-can-remember-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01512-9"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; suggest memory formation hinges on connections between groups of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02137-5"&gt;engram cells&lt;/a&gt;, which are neurons thought to capture and store distinct experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-memories-become-linked"&gt;How memories become linked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe each experience leaves a pattern of brain cell activation that can be switched on later. To see this process in action, neuroscientists tracked two sets of engram cells, each tied to a different memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that when one set of cells was reactivated, the other set sometimes lit up too, as if the memories had become linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea runs counter to the old notion that an individual neuron stores an entire memory. Instead, the memory might be in the connections these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-rewires-the-brain-to-strengthen-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; build and reshape over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such structural rearrangements help us handle new information without losing old experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-brain-cells-store-memories"&gt;Which brain cells store memories?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memory engram cells are groups of brain cells that, activated by specific experiences, change themselves to incorporate and thereby hold information in our brain,” said &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8365-2762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Clara Ortega-de San Luis&lt;/a&gt;, Postdoctoral Research Fellow and lead author on the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues monitored how similar or related memories were stored across different brain areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used genetic techniques to label neurons that fired for one event, then watched how those same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smartphones-are-teaching-us-how-to-supercharge-our-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; responded to a second event that felt related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major clue came from measuring how well these labeled neurons made new links with cells that were tied to older, separate experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics, a method that turns cells on or off with light, let them test whether blocking these newly formed links disrupted the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-one-protein-shapes-memory"&gt;How one protein shapes memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A specific protein, &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0520-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PSD-95&lt;/a&gt;, emerged as a gatekeeper of these engram cell connections. This protein sits at nerve cell junctions called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/24790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;synapses&lt;/a&gt; and helps anchor receptor molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team lowered the amount of PSD-95 in the neurons storing a given memory, these connections behaved differently. Under certain conditions, the memory seemed to linger even when researchers tried to dampen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That persistence hints at how the brain can hang on to memories that we might assume should fade. It also hints at why a shortage or disruption of PSD-95 could derail normal learning &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-memories-close-in-time-feel-connected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-cells-build-on-old-memories"&gt;Brain cells build on old memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work taps into a broader shift in neuroscience. Rather than focusing on single cells, many researchers now examine how multiple cells form networks that hold our daily experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using cutting-edge genetic tagging, scientists can identify where new links are happening and whether these connections are essential for recalling the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forgetting-things-is-a-natural-part-of-the-memory-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the previous studies mapped separate steps: encoding a memory, storing it, then reactivating it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project took it one step further by showing how the brain might slot fresh information into an existing network, so the old memory is updated instead of replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-findings-matter"&gt;Why these findings matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have debated how new learning manages not to overwrite older memories in the same region of the brain. According to Dr. Ryan, “we should search for information ‘between’ cells.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view suggests memories are not locked inside one specific location but scattered as connections that can be modified. If true, it may explain how we learn quickly from everyday life without dismantling what we already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies could one day target the proteins that enable these shifting connections. If molecules like PSD-95 shape synapses to store a memory, then changing them might help reframe harmful memories tied to fear or trauma, though more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-brain-cells-shape-daily-memory"&gt;How brain cells shape daily memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory isn’t purely academic. Our daily routines demand constant learning, whether it’s recalling names, navigating busy streets, or picking up a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain cells keep all that information flexible, yet stable, offers hope for tackling age-related memory issues or conditions that affect learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional work in the field has shown that certain neurons can take on multiple roles depending on the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those roles often shift over time, especially when new experiences pile up. By homing in on the connections, scientists add a piece to the puzzle of how these cells adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-this-research-could-lead"&gt;Where this research could lead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the complicated dance among engram cells might eventually guide how we teach, treat memory disorders, or support mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If wiring changes are at the core of learning, there might be clever ways to prompt healthy rearrangements in people struggling with conditions like post-traumatic stress or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study gives a peek into that process. It reveals a fragile, but critical, balance at the heart of learning: strengthen certain neural links for new knowledge, but keep enough structure so older skills and memories remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01512-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:23:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNYjY2WTNHQjBzSUJOSllETy10Zk1TMUlocWVyTW9tV184QlJYTHdxOTRubEFlNXhhRWJvd0Z5aGtqN29yeC1mTmVDRXNtdXUzS3AxYWtHN2NyaU94T0hHR2dMa2Z6cTBNOXAxTEVtSi1MSDFUdGFhY3ZSdmowMHM3aFpwTVAwVDRJbzFBY2RvMVdibXJ3YWxCZXhHN2ZpMmpfMVkxTw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists found an existing drug that turns human blood into mosquito poison - Boy Genius Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQQ1IxcDdjUnU1U25Hc1ltN0U1eE1NTjZhU2x5N3JuRkJBQkhlUHd1RV9hTE1EanJyck1RNW9YN2I3Z1N6VGJfamZoT1pVaUs2enJTdjdPSkI1T1pCdTBPbWFlWnBKTXJ6RHNieVI0LUpydTFLNm5lWWZVdTR1aEVWNFprUk52S1hfVkQ1UXk3SkZvSUpCcndMUEEwOXdlRlRnR3RKNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content no-dropcap"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a surprising and potentially game-changing approach to stopping malaria that involves turning human blood into a death sentence for mosquitos. The secret lies in an existing drug called nitisinone, which, once ingested by the insects, kills them within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine discovered this effect by testing mosquitoes that fed on the blood of three people already taking nitisinone for a rare genetic condition. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; were immediate. Every mosquito died within 12 hours, suggesting that the human blood they drank had become poison for them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That alone could make this drug a novel tool in our ongoing fight against one of the deadliest diseases on Earth. Using other medicines to turn human blood into poison for mosquitos isn’t a new concept, either. Ivermectin, another medication, has been used experimentally to achieve a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nitisinone offers distinct advantages, the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077736"&gt;researchers say&lt;/a&gt;. It works faster, sticks around longer in the bloodstream, and doesn’t target the nervous system. This means it’s less likely to harm other insects like bees or butterflies. And that last point is extremely crucial in any large-scale rollout where environmental impact is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

The fact that the drug is already approved for use in humans speeds up the process of getting it into broader testing—possibly even mass drug administration programs if future studies support its safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are challenges. The ecological impact of long-term use of the drug to turn human blood to poison for mosquitos needs deeper study. Scientists also caution against underestimating the mosquito’s ability to adapt, as resistance to the drug is always a risk.

Unlike spraying pesticides, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/scientists-invented-a-mosquito-repellent-that-lasts-for-over-a-week/"&gt;relying on mosquito deterrents&lt;/a&gt; and nets, or even &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/florida-mosquitoes-genetically-modified/"&gt;genetically modified mosquitos&lt;/a&gt; to help cull the population, this strategy flips the script entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of protecting humans from bites, it turns us into the danger. When a mosquito drinks from someone taking nitisinone, it’s not walking away, as human blood becomes poisonous for mosquitos when nitisinone is present.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future studies confirm what these early results suggest, nitisinone could redefine what it means to control mosquito populations by quietly turning to poison &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/mosquitoes-blood-taste-study/"&gt;the very thing mosquitos love&lt;/a&gt;: human blood.&lt;/p&gt;

But a researcher who was not involved in the study called the results “remarkable” because they highlight a path to a frustratingly elusive goal in medicine - harnessing a person’s own immune defenses to target common solid tumor cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Until now, cell-based immunotherapy has worked mainly on blood cancers, such as leukemia, but not the solid cancers that seed tumors in the breast, brain, lungs, pancreas and GI tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think this is a very exciting study,” said Patrick Hwu, president of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. “There’s still a lot of work to do … but this is a really great start in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the progress arrives at a sad time for science - and for patients, said the leader of the work, NIH immunotherapy pioneer Steven Rosenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two patients’ treatments using the experimental therapy had to be delayed because NIH’s capacity to make personalized cell therapies has been slowed by the firing of highly skilled staff and by purchasing slowdowns. Those occurred even before major layoffs took place Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quality of care at the NIH Clinical Center, the country’s largest research hospital, remains excellent, Rosenberg said. But the administration’s aggressive downsizing of staff and hampering of routine activities is beginning to delay that care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Everything I try to do, I try to do at warp speed. These are people with desperate illnesses and nowhere to go,” Rosenberg said. “Right now, assuming things don’t get any worse, it would be a month [delay]. These are not patients that have very many months left.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Natalie Phelps of Bainbridge Island, Washington, is one of those who can’t wait. The 43-year-old mother of two learned five years ago that GI symptoms that her doctors had attributed to her second pregnancy were actually caused by colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since then, Phelps has been through “pretty much any hell I can go through” - an 18-hour surgery to remove her initial tumor, radiation to her brain, three liver surgeries and 48 rounds of chemotherapy. Still, the cancer spread through her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This fall, she felt hope when she arrived at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for two days of intensive testing to determine whether she qualified for one of Rosenberg’s trials. She marveled at the quality of the medical care and the efficiency of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I was invited out, just to be screened, I was overjoyed. I felt like I won the jackpot,” Phelps said. “Walking into the NIH … it just made me so proud - it was such a beautiful building and everything was managed so professionally and efficiently, in a way that I hadn’t experienced at any health-care institute around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HHS responded to an email asking about clinical trial delays with a statement: “NIH and HHS are complying with President Trump’s executive order.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Progress builds over years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For decades, scientists have dreamed of harnessing patients’ own immune cells to attack cancers. Rosenberg has long been a leader in this field, at the very cutting edge of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2017, the first drug in a transformative new class of medicine - one based on immune cells harvested from patients’ blood and genetically engineered to target cancer cells - was approved to treat blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, a different type of cell-based immunotherapy was approved for melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or resisted other forms of treatment. Instead of engineering the cells, scientists harvest and expand cancer-attacking immune cells taken from patients’ own tumors - called TILs, short for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Those cells are normally present, but not in large enough numbers to slow down the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rosenberg’s work has driven both approaches to cancer therapy forward. But despite the advances, finding ways to tailor this cell-based immunotherapy approach to common solid tumors that cause the vast majority of cancer deaths has remained a major scientific challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Very rarely does research work in a straight line - you have ideas, you pursue them, most things do not work, some things do work. You build upon them,” Rosenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s what happened in the new study. Rosenberg and colleagues first tried to create TILs using the method that worked in melanoma for 18 patients with GI cancers that had spread. It failed completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a second iteration, his team sequenced the mutations present in each patient’s tumor and used that information to sift out and expand the TILs that could home in on that patient’s specific tumor cells. The results were far from a triumph, but provided a clue - this time, three of 39 patients’ tumors shrank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the last stage of the trial, the scientists added a drug called pembrolizumab that takes the brakes off immune cells. This time, eight of the 34 patients responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Right now, only a few labs in the country can do what they just did,” Hwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients who can’t wait for progress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rosenberg is already working to refine and improve upon the results. But he said that in his many decades of cancer research, he has never seen anything like the turmoil outside his lab, which is beginning to affect the science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two scientists involved in the specialized process of preparing cells for patients’ treatments were fired in the probationary purge. Nine highly skilled scientists on his team have appointments that need to be renewed in 2025 or early 2026, but with no assurance they will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If they are not, that will set us back more,” Rosenberg said. “We’ve had to slow down our work and delay the treatment of some patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even more-minor restrictions are throttling progress. Travel is restricted by an administration order, so Rosenberg couldn’t attend a meeting of the Society of Surgical Oncology where physicians and scientists exchange ideas that move cancer care forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After the probationary firings, the number of people capable of purchasing materials essential for research has plummeted, making it slower and more difficult to obtain supplies. Rosenberg is now worried that the massive reduction in force last week will make the process even more onerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Phelps went to NIH, she told her young children she was going to visit the best doctors in the country to see if they had a solution. Those doctors told her she was a good candidate for the TIL trial, with one caveat - she needed to wait for one of the many tiny tumors in her body to grow large enough to meet the minimum size criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She went home, where she has been anxiously waiting for her tumors to grow large enough to qualify for the trial. Now, she has a new source of fear: The changes the new administration has imposed have dampened her hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s one thing that seems unfair: Why would a metastatic cancer patient need any more stress?” Phelps said. “Why slow down the research when cancer rates are on the rise, particularly with young people under 50?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/04/04/sportsbooks-vip-programs-loyalty-hosts/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘VIP’ bettors say sportsbooks keep them playing, no matter the cost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;‘VIP’ bettors say sportsbooks keep them playing, no matter the cost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/03/cherry-blossom-dc-couple-picnic-annual-tradition/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Every year, they picnic under the cherry blossoms.

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/monohealthdepartment/posts/pfbid0zW43aGawceHQdXW7VDi1HTPgyaTXSf8V5W1gaKam1YtJHT2FaLGLXmzRkDhWZ7rbl?__cft__[0]=AZV5uoqSXoyei-EN9EzNxlf3ZlmfcVqaD2E_auZIlaJKkXI5XFZnnXW8F1uiX7BLt1OqRI9uDTAiFIMWqg_8tH9YBhZSJNyyMkBmvT83wwkDCqkbghWOBOCtFfWgLxJsJ5PTTHXPhUR19Llc4AHNlBx3y13HW2ebKci22t_ZowWUFAXdWbAQxAulNAO2AmRu7FA&amp;amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; shared Thursday, Mono County Health &amp;amp; Human Services confirmed that a young adult had died from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus,” Dr. Tom Boo, the county’s public health officer said. “The home had no evidence of mouse activity. We observed some mice in the workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. We haven’t identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person’s exposure to mice or their droppings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="88fw2hsm" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5183395-gene-hackmans-wife-betsy-arakawa-died-from-hantavirus-but-what-is-it/?ipid=promo-link-block1"&gt;Hantavirus&lt;/a&gt;, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,” said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “Early in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the CDC. All three deaths in Mono County were connected to this syndrome, which is spread by deer mice, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boo said deer mouse numbers are believed to be high this year in the Mammoth Lakes area, noting that “an increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of Hantavirus exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boo noted that of the three deaths reported in the county so far, they do not believe that any of them “engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead, these folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=160 160w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=256 256w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=320 320w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=640 640w, https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/GettyImages-758303597.jpg?w=876 876w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 876px" alt="" class="wp-image-3723328"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Color enhanced transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Hantavirus particles. (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the press release from Mono County Health &amp;amp; Human Services, all three residents began to feel ill in February. In all three cases, “there was some evidence of mice” in their workplaces “but no major infestations were found,” while one had “numerous mice in their home.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One person had been vacuuming “in one or more areas where investigators later found mouse droppings,” the department noted, adding that vacuuming “can aerosolize the virus through the air and lead to infection.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region — the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet. Ever since, the majority of U.S. cases have been reported in western states. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/data-research/cases/index.html"&gt;78 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in California between 1993 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-305934525" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While hantavirus is not uncommon in Mono County — there have been 27 cases reported since 1993 — cases are typically seen during late spring or summer, making the three cases reported already this year “strikingly unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior to the cases confirmed this year, Mono County had not seen a hantavirus infection since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus is not spread between people, health officials said. Roughly one-third of people who do become infected die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, New Mexico authorities confirmed that Arakawa — &lt;a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/search-warrant-reveals-details-surrounding-the-deaths-of-gene-hackman-his-wife-and-dog-in-santa-fe/"&gt;found dead in the home she shared with her husband&lt;/a&gt;, Hackman — had died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Authorities have not said how Arakawa, 65, may have become infected. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/u-s-world/judge-to-consider-request-to-withhold-investigation-records-related-to-deaths-of-gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa/"&gt;Investigators determined&lt;/a&gt; Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications of Alzheimer’s days after his wife died. Their dog, Zinna, was found dead of starvation and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A revolution is underway in gene editing—and at its forefront is David Liu, an American molecular biologist whose pioneering work is rewriting the building blocks of life with unprecedented precision.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A professor at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Liu was awarded a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences on Saturday for developing two transformative technologies: one already improving the lives of patients with severe genetic diseases, the other poised to reshape medicine in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke with AFP ahead of the Los Angeles ceremony for the prestigious Silicon Valley-founded award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will receive $3 million for his work on "base editing" and "prime editing," and plans to donate most of it to support his charitable foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ability to change a DNA sequence of our choosing into a new sequence of our choosing is a fundamentally very powerful capability," the 51-year-old said, foreseeing uses not just in human medicine but areas like developing more nutritious or disease-resistant crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Correcting the code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA is made up of four chemical "letters"—the nucleotide bases A, G, T and C. Mutations in this sequence cause thousands of human diseases, yet until recently, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gene+editing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene editing&lt;/a&gt; could only fix a limited number of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even CRISPR-Cas9, the groundbreaking technology that earned a Nobel Prize in 2020, has major limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cuts both strands of the DNA helix, making it most useful to disrupt rather than correct genes, while the process can introduce new errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being able to use genome editing to treat genetic diseases requires, in most cases, ways to correct a DNA misspelling, not simply to disrupt a gene," Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That insight led his lab to develop base editing, which uses the Cas9 protein—disabled so it can no longer cut both DNA strands—to find a target DNA sequence and another enzyme to convert one letter to another—for example, C to T or G to A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing the change—from T to C or A to G—was tougher. Liu's team overcame the challenge by engineering entirely new enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These base editors can now correct about 30% of the mutations that cause &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. The technology is already in at least 14 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of them, Beam Therapeutics—which Liu co-founded—announced it had treated patients of AATD, a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare+genetic+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rare genetic disorder&lt;/a&gt; affecting the lungs and liver, with a single drug infusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional gene therapies often disrupt faulty genes or work around them, base editing repairs the mutation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was the first time that humans have corrected a mutation that causes a genetic disease in a patient," Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Cystic fibrosis hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base editing, quickly dubbed "CRISPR 2.0," can't fix every mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 70% of the roughly 100,000 known disease-causing mutations remain out of its reach, including those caused by missing or extra letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expand the toolkit, Liu's lab introduced prime editing in 2019—a method capable of replacing entire sections of faulty DNA with corrected sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If CRISPR is like scissors that cut DNA, and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/base+editors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;base editors&lt;/a&gt; are like using a pencil to correct individual letters, then prime editing is the equivalent of a word processor's "find and replace" function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating this tool required a series of breakthroughs Liu's team describes as "small miracles." The result is, he said, "the most versatile way we know of to edit the human genome."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the targets Liu and his team have already pursued with prime editing: cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease usually caused by three missing DNA letters that causes thick mucus buildup in the lungs and digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu's lab has made much of its work freely accessible, sharing DNA blueprints through a nonprofit library used by tens of thousands of labs worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The science we create—which is ultimately funded by society, through governments and donors—ultimately goes back to benefit society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's Breakthrough Prize awards come at a fraught moment for U.S. science, as President Donald Trump's government strips funding for institutions like the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The NIH is a treasure, not just for this country but for the world," said Liu. "Trying to dismantle the heart of what supports science in this country is like burning your seed corn."&lt;/p&gt;

                American neurologist Stephen Hauser's work on multiple sclerosis (MS) started more than 45 years ago, when he met a young patient named Andrea.
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An American neurologist and an Italian epidemiologist whose work revolutionized the treatment of multiple sclerosis on Saturday won a prestigious Breakthrough Prize, the award nicknamed the "Oscars of science."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Stephen Hauser and Alberto Ascherio were recognized for their decades researching the debilitating neurodegenerative disease, which affects nearly three million people worldwide and was long considered an impenetrable enigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hauser's work on multiple sclerosis (MS) started more than 45 years ago, when he met a young patient named Andrea, "an extraordinarily talented young woman who was already an attorney" and working at the White House under then-president Jimmy Carter, he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then MS appeared in an explosive fashion and destroyed her life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I remember seeing her, unable to speak, paralyzed on the right side, unable to swallow, and soon, unable to breathe on her own, and I remember thinking that this was the most unfair thing I had ever seen in medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then 27 years old, he decided to make it his life's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rough road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the time, we had no treatments for MS. In fact, there was also a pessimism that treatments could ever be developed," said Hauser, now 74 and director of the neuroscience institute at the University of California San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists knew the disease, which damages the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/central+nervous+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and leads to paralyzing cognitive and motor problems, was caused by the immune system turning on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they thought the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/white+blood+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;white blood cells&lt;/a&gt; known as T cells were the lone culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hauser questioned that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying the role played in the disease by B cells, another type of white blood cell, he and his colleagues managed to recreate the damage MS causes to the human nervous system in small monkeys known as marmosets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US federal body overseeing medical research dismissed the link as "biologically implausible," and turned down their application for funding for a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hauser and his team pressed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They persuaded pharmaceutical company Genentech to back testing. In 2006, they got resounding results: treatments targeting B cells were associated with "a dramatic, more than 90% reduction in brain inflammation," Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was "something of a scope that had never been seen before."&lt;/p&gt;

                Italian epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio investigated why MS mostly affected people in the northern hemisphere.
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That threw open a door to bring new treatments to market that slow the advance of the disease in many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also raised other questions. For example, what would cause our white blood cells to turn against us?&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The virus connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a question that puzzled Ascherio, today a professor at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to investigate why MS mostly affected people in the northern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The geographical distribution of MS was quite striking," he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MS is very uncommon in tropical countries and near the equator."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made him wonder whether a virus could be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his team carried out a long-term study following millions of young US military recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly 20 years of research, they came up with an answer. In 2022, they confirmed a link between MS and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common infection responsible for another well-known disease, infectious mononucleosis, or mono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people infected with EBV will never develop MS," said Ascherio, 72.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everyone who develops MS has had EBV first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery still did not explain why MS occurs. But it fueled hope of finding new treatments and preventive measures for a disease that remains uncurable, and whose current treatments do not work on all patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascherio's breakthrough could also help treat other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now trying also to extend our investigation, to investigate the role of viral infection in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amyotrophic+lateral+sclerosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;," also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link remains theoretical for now. But "there is some evidence," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like where we were on MS 20 or 30 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;

The research tracked hundreds of middle school students in China and found that distinct patterns in how gratitude developed over time were closely linked with levels of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore a key question: How do changes in gratitude during middle school affect a young person’s mental health? While many previous studies have shown that gratitude and depression are related, most of that work relied on snapshots taken at a single point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few studies have looked at how gratitude changes during adolescence—a period of life marked by emotional growth, academic pressure, and social challenges. Even fewer have examined how self-esteem might influence the connection between gratitude and depression over time. The new study aimed to fill that gap by following students across three points over two years, beginning in eighth grade and ending in ninth grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As researchers in psychology, we were inspired to explore factors that could affect adolescent mental health,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liuyue-Huang" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Liuyue Huang&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher affiliated with the Department of Psychology and the Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, at the University of Macau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The emergence of positive psychology offered a valuable perspective, shifting the focus from merely treating mental illness to fostering strengths like gratitude. We saw gratitude as a promising, modifiable factor to enhance well-being and resilience during the critical developmental stage of adolescence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, supervised by Professor Peilian Chi, the researchers recruited 660 students from two middle schools in Guangzhou, China. Participants were around 13 years old at the start of the study. Of the original group, 564 students completed all three waves of data collection. At each point, students completed well-established questionnaires measuring their levels of gratitude, self-esteem, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gratitude was measured using a six-item scale that asked students how often they felt thankful for people and experiences in their lives. Self-esteem was assessed with the widely used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and depression symptoms were evaluated using a brief version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The researchers also collected information on students’ gender, age, and overall life satisfaction to account for these influences in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a statistical method designed to identify patterns of change over time, the researchers uncovered four distinct “trajectories” of gratitude. These groups differed both in the starting levels of gratitude and in how gratitude changed over the two-year span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest group (about 36 percent of participants) showed consistently low gratitude levels across all time points and was labeled the “low-gratitude-persistence” group. A second group, making up nearly 30 percent of students, started with high gratitude and continued to increase slightly over time—these students belonged to the “high-gratitude-increasing” group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group, comprising about 24 percent, started with high gratitude but showed a decline, labeled the “high-gratitude-declined” group. The final group, about 11 percent of participants, began with low gratitude but improved significantly by the end of the study—this was the “low-gratitude-improving” group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at how these patterns related to depression in the final year of middle school. They found that students in the two increasing-gratitude groups—both those who started high and increased, and those who started low but improved—reported significantly lower depression scores than students in the low-gratitude-persistence group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, students whose gratitude declined over time did not differ in depression levels from those with persistently low gratitude. This suggests that both the level and the direction of change in gratitude matter for adolescent mental health. Merely starting out with high gratitude did not protect students from depression if their gratitude declined during this critical period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that the ‘High-gratitude-declined’ group—those who started with high gratitude but saw it drop—didn’t show a lower risk of depression compared to the consistently low-gratitude group,” Huang told PsyPost. “This suggests that maintaining high or increasing gratitude over time might be more critical for mental health than just having high gratitude at one point, highlighting the importance of sustained positive development rather than a fixed state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem turned out to play a key role in these relationships. When researchers examined whether changes in self-esteem could explain the link between gratitude and depression, they found strong evidence that it did. Students whose gratitude improved—either from a high or low starting point—tended to show increases in self-esteem, which in turn predicted lower levels of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, once self-esteem was accounted for, the direct relationship between gratitude trajectory and depression disappeared, suggesting that gratitude protects against depression mainly by supporting adolescents’ self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that developing gratitude in adolescents can significantly lower the risk for depression, with self-esteem playing a key role in this process,” Huang explained. “For parents and educators, this means encouraging gratitude practices could be a practical and effective way to support adolescents’ mental health, especially during middle school years when emotional challenges often peak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support what psychologists call the “broaden-and-build” theory, which suggests that positive emotions like gratitude help people build psychological resources that can buffer them against stress and negative feelings. In this case, the resource being built is self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the researchers acknowledge several limitations. All data came from self-report questionnaires, which can be influenced by how participants interpret the questions or how they want to present themselves. The study focused only on students from a specific region in China, so the findings may not apply to adolescents in other cultural or educational contexts. Additionally, the researchers only examined one possible mechanism—self-esteem—leaving open the possibility that other psychological or environmental factors may also influence how gratitude affects depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study’s strengths—including its relatively large sample size, repeated measurements, and attention to patterns over time—make it an important contribution to understanding adolescent well-being. Future research could expand by including more diverse populations, exploring other potential mediators such as social support or coping skills, and testing interventions that directly aim to boost gratitude and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d like to note that gratitude is a dynamic resource that can be cultivated with practice, and its benefits ripple through self-esteem to improve mental health,” Huang said. “We encourage readers to try small gratitude exercises with the teens in their lives, like keeping a gratitude journal, and to see this as a proactive step toward building resilience in a world full of challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2025.2469513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sowing seeds of gratitude: the effect of the trajectories of Adolescents’ gratitude on depression and the mediating role of self-esteem&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Liuyue Huang, Shan Zhao, Yixiao Shi, Liutong Ou, Hongfei Du, and Peilian Chi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 16:14:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUnV2WHE2RDNBaFdpaFVVUTlIRnpibXRVaGFOVmJ0WVVNZVRSTks1YUlKTFBrLTVpQjlQOUEtTThWNFJuaV84a1ZnWF9Lem5GS1gxeVVtbUtydENMbVRUVlRqb3hCVVRHMU54bzhjVHdfR0dkbHBDXzhIQV83bER2bGRla01CbWdWb0liWkZzREo4TTdhVHE5M1g3Nm0wWGhoREh2d3k0bGNQdEk</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover Mechanisms That Prevent Autoimmune Diseases and Win $600,000 Crafoord Prize - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxOb2pVNmJnbENuNGVXdGJVZ2M5aHJ5NE1SVzFvZU5GVVpSazR3UTg0RjAzTTYtSE01UlRhbkhiUVR0QTB1eDBqNzctdEVlcktBNjhuZ3lGVE1xWFR1ZGh5RktlSENMeWtsS05jZVI3QnlOQ3NOWnE1clloUVJfaTd6Z0RBNTJKcEl2STRSUUIxSng0WFoyZXA4RndDdHp2cTh0QmZ4WVNwSnVWZnVGa0xBVk4zY2JRNW53azZzYUxBWGI5TUgy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two researchers in the US and Australia have discovered important mechanisms that prevent B cells from attacking the body’s own tissues in autoimmune diseases like arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis—and in the process have won a prestigious prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the body’s immune system protects us from viruses, bacteria, and foreign substances. However, in autoimmune diseases, the immune system starts attacking tissues in the body instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers had long tried to discover the cause of autoimmune diseases. But, Christopher Goodnow and David Nemazee, independently of each other, adopted a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked why we do not all develop these diseases. Their focus was on B cells which, together with white blood cells and T cells, are the building blocks of our complex immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have given us a new and detailed understanding of the mechanisms that normally prevent faulty B cells from attacking tissues in the body, explaining why most of us are not affected by autoimmune diseases,” &lt;a href="https://www.kva.se/en/news/crafoord-prize-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says Olle Kämpe&lt;/a&gt;, member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and chair of the Crafoord Prize committee that awarded the pair 6 million Swedish kronor ($600,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neutralize B cells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, physicians have started to experiment by using existing drugs to neutralize B cells for patients with severe autoimmune diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/exciting-new-car-t-cell-treatment-for-lupus-could-end-the-need-for-lifelong-medication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;including lupus&lt;/a&gt;, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, which has proven to be very effective at improving their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTO-IMMUNE RELATED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Drinking Baking Soda Could Be Cheap, Safe Way to Combat Autoimmune Disease, Says Scientists" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/drinking-baking-soda-could-be-cheap-safe-way-to-combat-autoimmune-disease-says-scientists/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Drinking Baking Soda Could Be Cheap, Safe Way to Combat Autoimmune Disease, Says Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this year’s Crafoord Prize Laureates, we have gained fundamental new knowledge about what is happening in the immune system during autoimmune disease attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This also paves the way for development of new forms of therapies that eventually can cure these diseases—or might prevent them in the future,” said one professor of clinical immunology at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christopher Goodnow, the news of the Crafoord Prize came as a wonderful surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the most amazing phone call of my life!” said the Professor at the School of Biomedical Sciences’ Cellular Genomics Futures Institute at the University of New South Wales-Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m honored… and it’s also wonderful to share the prize with David Nemazee. We were friendly competitors working at different places in the world, and the two of us arrived at complementary answers at a time when most working in the field didn’t believe B cell tolerance was a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

He just didn’t have anything concrete to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Until recently, the answer was, ‘I don’t know,’ ” said Dr. Pastuszak, who is now a urologist at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So he started looking for an answer. Cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational purposes in all but 11 states and was used at least once by 52.5 million Americans in 2021, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Yet because it remains illegal under federal law, it’s hard to study, and its long term health effects are still poorly understood, said Dr. Omer Raheem, a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic who practices in the United States and Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even so, when it comes to the male reproductive system, some effects of cannabis are becoming clear. By looking at 48 studies from around the world, Dr. Pastuszak &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7385722/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;found in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis products &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; harm a man’s chances of conceiving children. Finally, he feels, he has an answer for his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“THC, certainly in smoked form, can impact semen,” Dr. Pastuszak said, and therefore damage male fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The Hollywood star and his wife were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Feb. 26. While Hackman is believed to have died from “hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributory factor," his wife died from a rare illness. Arakawa, who was 65 years old, died from hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus, spread by rodents, can cause fatigue, fever, muscle aches, coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In severe cases, like Arakawa's, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tragically, three people in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California have died from the same illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa during Gene Hackman Sighting at Spago - September 5, 1986 at Spago in West Hollywood, California, United States.

They’ve been found in our brains, &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/microplastics-have-infected-critical-arctic-ice-algae/"&gt;algae in the Arctic ice&lt;/a&gt;, human placentas, beer, and breast milk—but now, according to one luxury clinic in London, they can be filtered out of your blood with a handy microplastic detox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the promise behind &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clarifyclinics.com/"&gt;Clarify Clinics&lt;/a&gt;, which offers an expensive service to remove microplastics from your blood. The treatment involves drawing blood, filtering the plasma through a proprietary system that claims to trap microplastics and other “toxins,” like forever chemicals, and then returning the filtered plasma to the body. The whole process takes about two hours and starts at a hefty £9,750 (roughly $12,600 USD).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic’s founder, Yael Cohen, says many of their patients report better sleep, more energy, and sharper focus in the weeks following treatment. Some are dealing with chronic fatigue or long Covid. Others are just curious—or worried about their long-term health in a world where plastic pollution is inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="Man getting blood test preparation in clinic" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5879422" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?quality=82 1600w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blood-Test.jpeg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;span class="image-meta block clearfix"&gt;&lt;span class="source right"&gt;Image source: Yakobchuk Olena/Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the buzz around microplastic detox therapy, the science remains unsettled. Microplastics have been detected in human arteries, &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/you-wont-believe-the-latest-place-they-found-microplastics/"&gt;testicles&lt;/a&gt;, and other places in the body. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;One 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; linked their presence in arteries to a higher risk of heart disease, but it didn’t establish a direct causal link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

But this treatment taps into a growing wellness trend: hyper-personalized, high-dollar biohacking for people trying to stay a step ahead of aging, pollution, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From stem cell infusions in the Bahamas to total plasma exchange popularized by longevity influencers, the market for speculative health treatments is booming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-promises-to-clean-your-blood-of-microplastics-clarify-clinics/"&gt;Even Cohen acknowledges&lt;/a&gt; that more research is needed to prove the microplastic detox actually makes a difference. However, she points to her patients’ personal experiences—and her own improved sleep data—as early signs that this kind of detox could be doing something beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of her clients, the test results showing fewer plastic particles after treatment feel like proof enough. Still, there’s a key problem: measuring the amount of microplastics anywhere is notoriously difficult.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in tightly controlled labs, contamination is hard to avoid. The particles are tiny, cling to everything, and float in the air. A stray fiber from clothing can skew all the results of your microplastic detox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, detoxing your blood of microplastics might offer some peace of mind. Just know that when you’re dropping almost $13K on the treatment, there’s no scientific certainty that it’s actually doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
