			&lt;p&gt;Those who have never endured the relentless ringing of tinnitus can only dream of the torment. In fact, a bad dream may be the closest some get to experiencing anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subjective sound, which can also be a hissing, buzzing, or clicking, is heard by no one else, and it may be present constantly, or may come and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists at the University of Oxford now &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/hearing-research/silencing-tinnitus/how-does-sleep-affect-tinnitus/"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; that sleep and tinnitus are closely intertwined in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings hint at a fundamental relationship between the two conditions – one that has, surprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time"&gt;been overlooked&lt;/a&gt; in the brain until very recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-ear-wax-might-hold-clues-to-early-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Ear Wax Might Hold Clues to Early Parkinson's, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What first made me and my colleagues curious were the remarkable parallels between tinnitus and sleep," neuroscientist Linus Milinski at Oxford's Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tinnitus is a debilitating medical condition, whereas sleep is a natural state we enter regularly, yet both appear to rely on spontaneous brain activity. Because there is still no effective treatment for subjective tinnitus, I believe that exploring these similarities might offer new ways to understand and eventually treat phantom percepts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'phantom percept' is when our brains fool us into thinking we are seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling something that is not there, physically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people only experience phantom percepts during sleep, but for around 15 percent of the world's population, an inescapable noise rings in their ears during waking hours, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is the world's most common phantom percept, and yet there is no known cause or cure, despite a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK217855/"&gt;long list of hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many individuals with tinnitus &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735455"&gt;report poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000040303"&gt;show poor sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;, the potential connection to this crucial bodily function has only recently come to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Milinski led a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, which the authors claim is the first to consider, at a functional level, how sleep might impact tinnitus, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oxford researchers proposed that the large spontaneous waves of brain activity that occur during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, or non-&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-one-step-closer-to-finding-trigger-in-brain-for-rem-sleep"&gt;rapid eye movement sleep&lt;/a&gt; (non-REM), might suppress the brain activity that leads to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that idea, the team turned to ferrets, which have a similar auditory system to humans. In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0304306"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2024, researchers found that the ferrets that developed stronger tinnitus also showed disrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could actually see these sleep problems appear at the same time as tinnitus after noise exposure," Milinski told ScienceAlert. "This suggested, for the first time, a clear link between developing tinnitus and disrupted sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the ferrets that developed tinnitus showed overly responsive brain activity to sound. When the ferrets finally did manage to slip into non-REM sleep, that hyperactivity was dampened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that sleep may temporarily mask the effects of tinnitus by engaging the same brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that deep sleep may indeed help mitigate tinnitus and could reveal natural brain mechanisms for modulating abnormal activity," said Milinski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on non-human animals has its obvious limitations, but the same sort of brain activity patterns may exist in humans, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since their 2022 review, Milinski says the field has rapidly expanded, with a growing number of large-scale studies investigating how sleep, the environment, and tinnitus interact – and not just in ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182105" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-642x263.jpeg" alt="Graphical abstract of the study's findings on tinnitus and sleep" class="size-medium wp-image-182105" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-642x263.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-1200x492.jpeg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-768x315.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-1536x630.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-2048x840.jpeg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/fcac089ga1-600x246.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182105" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A graphic depicting the study's findings.

It may be a kind of vicious circle, although I do not believe it is unbreakable," speculates Milinski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we do not sleep well, we become more vulnerable to stress, and stress is one of the strongest factors known to worsen tinnitus. Stress can even trigger tinnitus to begin with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could not only lead to effective tinnitus treatments, it may help scientists better understand the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-state-of-sleep-could-reveal-secrets-of-consciousness"&gt;mysteries of sleep&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 review was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Lately, as the government’s once-impressive eradication programmes have faltered, there has been an increase in mosquito and sandfly related viruses such as chikungunya, dengue, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/02/outbreak-of-oropouche-virus-in-brazil-should-be-a-wake-up-call-say-experts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;oropouche&lt;/a&gt; and zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the past months, Cuba has suffered a particularly terrible epidemic of chikungunya, which, while rarely fatal, causes a week-long fever and terrible joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alerts were first raised in Matanzas in Cuba’s heartlands last July. By late October, health officials said there had been 13,000 new fever cases across the country in a week. But recent reports &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/14/cuban-authorities-battle-wave-of-mosquito-borne-illnesses" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggest one-third of the Cuban population&lt;/a&gt; has been infected, and the government officially called the outbreak an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fa90bd4f-3f4d-4d96-ad56-252710a6cf40" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A primary school serves as an evacuation centre housing more than 300 people in Grito de Yara, Granma province. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Eileen Sosin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the east, where Melissa swept through, such illnesses have been heaping misery on those trying to rebuild.

Their house, very close to the Cauto River, was inundated and barely standing. Pérez swiftly contracted chikungunya. She has struggled to get up, applies alcohol compresses to lower the fever and relies on the paracetamol her sister gives her. Many families without access to repellants and medicines have been forced to rely on natural remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cauto del Paso dam, the largest in the province, started to spill over the day after the hurricane arrived, releasing &lt;a href="https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-11-03-u1-e197721-s27061-nid314171-alivio-granma-presa-cauto-paso-reduce-caudal-tras" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;4,000 cubic metres a second&lt;/a&gt; at the peak of the flood, according to state officials.

			&lt;p&gt;A major new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182467" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 1,600 people has found that a GLP-1 pill form of the drug orforglipron works about as well as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/volunteers-lose-up-to-25-body-weight-in-high-dose-wegovy-trials"&gt;injectable semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; for people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182467" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following an experiment conducted over 72 weeks and across 136 sites in 10 countries, a team led by obesity-medicine specialist Deborah Horn of the University of Texas reported that participants lost an average of 9.6 percent of their body weight on the highest dose of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the roughly 10 to 15 percent loss in body mass commonly seen in people with diabetes taking injectable semaglutide over a similar period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-weight-loss-strategy-is-5x-more-effective-than-ozempic-trials-find"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Weight Loss Strategy Is 5x More Effective Than Ozempic, Trials Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2825%2902165-8"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;, "the findings indicate that orforglipron could address the unmet need for oral therapy by achieving outcomes similar to those of injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists, potentially shifting treatment paradigms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs exploit the body's natural mechanisms for reducing appetite after a meal. When you eat, your gut releases a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;), which activates receptors in various organs. When these receptors are triggered, a few things happen: your &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2012.11.008"&gt;appetite decreases&lt;/a&gt;, your pancreas &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.1.15"&gt;increases insulin&lt;/a&gt; and reduces glucagon release, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/XCE.0000000000000321"&gt;digestion slows&lt;/a&gt; so blood sugar rises more gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs are synthetic mimics of that hormone, triggering the same pathways in ways that can help people with diabetes regulate their blood sugar, and, more recently, assist people in losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the drug can only be administered by injection. Its peptides &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.08.032"&gt;break down too quickly&lt;/a&gt; in stomach acid, ruling out oral doses of the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orforglipron, by contrast, is not a peptide, but still activates the same receptor as GLP-1. It's also absorbed in the digestive tract like a more conventional drug. So far, signs of its efficacy are promising: a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2511774"&gt;previous clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 3,127 people with obesity, but without diabetes, showed an average 12.4 percent loss in body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study was designed to observe how the drug behaves in people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-restricted-eating-helps-control-blood-sugar-in-type-2-diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The 1,613 participants had all been diagnosed with the condition and were classified as either overweight or obese. The average age of the participants was 57, and the average weight was 101 kilograms (223 pounds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were sorted into four groups. One group was given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182467" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/incredible-placebo-study-shows-fake-pills-can-reduce-stress"&gt;no active drug ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a control. The other three groups were given orforglipron at a dosage of either 6, 12, or 36 milligrams. For 72 weeks, each participant took a daily dose of their assigned pill while maintaining a diet in which 500 calories had been cut from their baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither the researchers nor the participants knew which pill each participant was taking, a technique known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-clinical-trial-shows-micro-doses-of-lsd-can-increase-a-person-s-pain-tolerance"&gt;double-blinding&lt;/a&gt; that reduces bias when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those results were pretty conclusive. The group on the highest dose, 36 milligrams, lost, on average, 9.6 percent of their body weight, or around 9.6 kilograms. The 12-milligram group lost an average of 7 percent of their body weight, and the 6-milligram group 5.1 percent. The placebo group, on average, lost 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An astonishing 26 percent of the group on the highest dose lost more than 15 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other health indicators had improved. Blood sugar markers showed a significant improvement for all doses of orforglipron compared to the placebo, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; markers also improved. Side effects were similar to the side effects of injectable GLP-1 drugs; nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation – all unsurprising, given the way the drug works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not quite as effective as a once-weekly 15-milligram injection of GLP-1 drug tirzepatide, which demonstrated an average of 14.7 percent of body weight lost in diabetic participants in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01200-X"&gt;an earlier clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, but the ease, comfort, and accessibility of a pill may make the slightly lower effectiveness a worthwhile trade-off for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know it is harder for individuals with diabetes to lose weight. It is exciting to have an oral medication that provides double-digit weight loss, which on average was 23 pounds," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106740"&gt;Horn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once FDA approved, orforglipron is scheduled to be available in 2026 at a significantly decreased cost compared to current injectables. This could position it to be the 'metformin' of obesity and become widely covered by insurance plans, opening the door to treatment for all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02165-8"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In reality, the condition usually develops slowly, with subtle symptoms that are easy to overlook. Early signs may include persistent fatigue, unexplained weight gain, fluid retention, coughing when lying down, shortness of breath, or sleep disturbances. Dr Dmitry Yaranov, a cardiologist and heart transplant surgeon, emphasises that recognising these warning signs early is essential. By identifying the subtle indicators of a struggling heart, individuals can seek medical care promptly, manage the condition effectively, and reduce the risk of serious complications. Awareness and timely intervention can significantly improve long-term heart health and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding heart failure and how it develops&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body’s needs. This inefficiency can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs, abdomen, and other tissues, causing a range of symptoms that may not initially seem heart-related. Unlike acute heart attacks, heart failure often progresses quietly, and early signs can be mistaken for fatigue, stress, or ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Failure Warning: 4 Symptoms You Might Be Overlooking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov highlights that recognising these early, subtle symptoms allows patients to receive care before the condition worsens, improving outcomes and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart failure: Early warning signs that are overlooked&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden weight gain: An early warning sign of heart failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked signs of heart failure is sudden weight gain. This usually occurs over a few days and results from fluid retention. When the heart struggles to pump efficiently, fluid accumulates in the body, causing swelling and rapid weight increase. Dr Yaranov explains, “Your scale can detect these changes before your body feels them. A sudden gain, especially accompanied by swelling in the legs or abdomen, can be one of the first signals that your heart is under stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this early can prompt timely evaluation and treatment, potentially preventing further fluid buildup and complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic cough and wheezing related to heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A persistent cough or wheezing, particularly when lying down, can be a subtle but significant sign of heart failure. This differs from a cough caused by a common cold because it is linked to fluid accumulation in the lungs. When lying flat, fluid can shift and irritate the airways, triggering coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov advises, “If your cough worsens when you lie down or feels unusual compared to typical colds, it may indicate your heart is struggling to maintain circulation. This warrants further medical assessment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digestive symptoms: Nausea and loss of appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure can also affect the digestive system. Reduced blood flow to the gut may slow digestion and lead to symptoms such as nausea, loss of appetite, or feeling full after small meals. These signs are often subtle but can indicate that the heart is not supplying enough oxygen-rich blood to the digestive organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Yaranov, “When the heart slows, the gut responds. Feeling nauseous or unusually full can be an early, quiet signal that something is wrong with your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive changes: Confusion and memory loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is highly sensitive to changes in blood flow, and reduced circulation from heart inefficiency can cause cognitive issues. Patients may experience memory lapses, confusion, difficulty concentrating, or a sense of mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov notes, “Your brain may notice reduced blood supply before you feel physically unwell. Trouble focusing or forgetting simple tasks can be subtle early warnings that the heart is not pumping efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep problems as a heart warning sign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are another symptom that can indicate early heart failure. Difficulty falling asleep, frequent waking during the night, or needing extra pillows to breathe comfortably can be linked to fluid buildup in the lungs and reduced cardiac efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov explains, “Restless nights are often dismissed as insomnia or stress. However, when the heart is struggling, these sleep issues can be a signal that your body needs help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing heart failure: Tips to act on early warning signs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recognising early symptoms is crucial, taking proactive measures can help reduce the risk of heart failure or slow its progression. Lifestyle modifications, regular monitoring, and timely medical interventions play a key role in protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a heart-healthy diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet low in salt, saturated fats, and added sugars helps prevent fluid retention and high blood pressure, both of which can strain the heart. Focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Monitoring portion sizes and reducing processed foods can support weight control and improve cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor weight and fluid changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly tracking your weight can help identify sudden fluid retention early. Even a small, unexplained increase in a few days should prompt attention. Keeping an eye on swelling in the ankles, legs, or abdomen can also help detect early signs of heart stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate, consistent exercise strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and supports overall cardiovascular health. Activities such as walking, swimming, or cycling are effective, but individuals should consult a doctor before starting any new exercise routine, especially if early symptoms are present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep supports heart health by regulating blood pressure and reducing stress on the cardiovascular system. Establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleeping environment, and addressing sleep disturbances early can help prevent worsening heart strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress and monitor symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can increase heart rate and blood pressure, worsening heart function over time. Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help. Additionally, keeping a record of unusual symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, or cognitive changes can provide valuable information for your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early evaluation by a cardiologist is essential if multiple warning signs appear. Routine check-ups, blood pressure monitoring, and heart function tests can detect problems before they become serious, allowing for timely treatment and better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;When to seek medical advice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single symptom does not automatically mean heart failure, a combination of sudden weight gain, coughing when lying down, digestive disturbances, memory issues, and sleep problems should prompt medical evaluation. Early detection allows doctors to manage the condition effectively and prevent serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By paying attention to these subtle signs, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their heart health, seek timely medical care, and improve long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/why-your-ankles-swell-experts-reveal-10-hidden-causes-including-early-signs-of-heart-failure/articleshow/125453400.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Why your ankles swell: Experts reveal 10 hidden causes, including early signs of heart failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAJBVV95cUxONl9CekJvMjJGV0JST1RfQlZBOEwyWmhpODhCS3JlakJkTS01dHdPQTZqb2plV2hYb1RpaHQwUmRFaHBGbFhUeHk3OUc4MVJyUWNBUmlaT05VZFFBcVgyMFZxamJ0VHB2aWJuNlFkN3hOUUlQbHlpQl9uWE9jdll4WnBXTl9FMEhPdFJYOHpLclpEbUhBM0xrQTIwS1dvLU11ZjhpN2RKNU45RTEtazJiWUV1YktIZnE0cWt5WnAzUzc3aGdsZVJ0NGVxS3J5VFRZODVLN21hVEttVExFeDd6NnNUQzhHUlY3ZTNqVEZFSVFKZVV5bG1XWlhpcVpGanhQUGQ3aHdNaTNMdFlxaGROUnN0ZnExTm5BS2VablVOUzgxcnQ0UFlMS1BKN25BODJMWXZIWVgxLUxhTl9q</guid></item><item><title>顶级神经科学家揭示了一种对大脑健康最好的补充剂，它也能改善睡眠-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/top-neuroscientist-reveals-the-one-best-supplement-for-brain-health-that-also-improves-sleep/articleshow/125453704.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, wellness experts, and neuroscientists all emphasise on one thing: good sleep = healthy brain = healthy life. The brain is the command center of our body, controlling all our actions. Imagine it as the CPU of our body; now, imagine what would happen if it suddenly started to lag? All our actions, reflexes and control depend on it. For brain health and its optimal function, some naturally occurring supplements are required, one of which is magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Robert Love recently identified magnesium as his top supplement for supporting both optimal brain health and sleep, aligning with the rapidly growing trend on social media for magnesium and within the wellness community. As Love and other thought leaders point out, magnesium is a key player in hundreds of biochemical reactions that drive cognition, memory, focus, and recovery-one of the primary foundational nutrients anyone looking to support brain longevity and restful sleep should be getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The question is: Why magnesium?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays an important role in brain activity, being involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in the body. According to neuroscientist Robert Love, optimum levels of magnesium are associated with enhanced neural transmission, better memory retention, and improved cognitive ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer research, according to Robert Love, has started to link low levels of magnesium with a higher risk of neurodegenerative problems and chronic brain fog-symptoms that too many people ignore until it's a long-term problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, magnesium enables healthy electrical activity that supports memory, learning, and neuroplasticity-the brain's inherent ability to adapt and change. According to Love, maintaining adequate magnesium supports not only day-to-day focus but, long-term, provides a protective buffer against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magnesium and sleep: Is there a link&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium doesn't just serve the waking brain; it's also strongly associated with the quality and depth of sleep. On Instagram, Love and other neuroscientists emphasize how this mineral balances the nervous system, lowering the stress hormones in the evening and smoothly easing one into those slower brainwave states needed for deep, restorative rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellness experts and neuroscientists suggest that supplementing with the right form of magnesium will often translate to less interruption during the night, improved sleep efficiency, and even reduced symptoms of insomnia. This positive ripple effect carries over into the next day, as users report steadier energy, sharper recall, and better emotional balance--each a downstream benefit of high-quality sleep supported by proper magnesium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which type of magnesium is the best?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not all types of magnesium are created equal when it comes to promoting brain function and sleep. Magnesium threonate stands out-it is the only form able to cross the blood-brain barrier, elevating levels directly in the brain. In clinical studies, it has been suggested that magnesium threonate improves memory and facilitates learning beyond its beneficial sleep effects. Magnesium glycinate is another broadly recommended type for sleep, having an added calming effect on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dosage, safety and practical tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Love and other experts remind the audience that, with a few exceptions, magnesium is generally safe, but yielding the best results often requires consistent, measured use. Typical dosages associated with sleep and supporting the brain range between 150 to 400 mg daily, depending on individual need, dietary intake, and medical history. As always, anyone considering supplementation should consult a healthcare professional, especially if taking other medications or managing chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;To maximize magnesium's benefits:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take magnesium threonate at night to help promote better sleep and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycinate is well-tolerated and effective if threonate is unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid magnesium oxide and other poorly absorbed forms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair magnesium with a healthy evening routine-dimming lights, limiting screen time, and unwinding mindfully for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The message from neuroscientist Robert Love is clear: magnesium is not some kind of fashionable "hack" but a science-backed, key nutrient for anyone trying to keep cognition sharp and sleep deep and refreshing. When appropriately selected and thoughtfully incorporated into one's daily routine, the effects on mental clarity and resilience can be transformative, showing tangible benefits both overnight and in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxQSVRnajdpUmpPdTBqSENnSHdFeGpSNFFsbUFqMVNDbHRuNThzcUowVkJHdEp1ZEhaVEY1b1RNZEpITE9ySm1UT3cwbHYtNGJqOGJreVl2enpDNXhqMEhOeXFzX1dLdktuTV82WHFCb1lIaXhwSHZRTVFyYTFhSEl5dXQxTUZsT2dTMXdkbkRFTzdXOXRmREwtT3pobDJtZXAyWm1iQkFwdWdrNEllOVRvU1llT29mcDlQcU1NRGF1dVZOU0E3VjU0Q0hPbC11TnZFUWZWUFh3dlV3bWZoREI4dmd4dFhPaUwyRXNUQ3VRc2I0WDUxRjB2cDI3cEhaLWxKenVWUEJBaGpDdEJO</guid></item><item><title>心脏外科医生说躺着咳嗽可能是心力衰竭的症状|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/heart-surgeon-says-coughing-while-lying-down-may-be-symptom-of-heart-failure-101763608605377.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/heart-surgeon-says-coughing-while-lying-down-may-be-symptom-of-heart-failure-101763608605377.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we think of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiac-surgeon-shares-5-habits-to-avoid-to-reduce-the-risk-of-heart-failure-101763090463915.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart failure"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, movie scenes of someone clutching their chest and collapsing often come to mind.

He points out, “Your scale often knows before you do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chronic cough or wheezing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cardiac surgeon warns that a chronic cough linked to heart failure can feel different from the usual coughs of a common cold. He explains, “A cough that worsens when lying down isn’t always lungs, sometimes it’s the heart struggling to keep up. If it feels ‘different’ than a cold, pay attention.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nausea or loss of appetite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gut related issues like nausea and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-gastroenterologist-lists-8-signs-your-body-is-telling-you-about-nutrient-deficiencies-tiredness-loss-of-appetite-101757401498085.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="loss of appetite"&gt;loss of appetite&lt;/a&gt; can also be linked to heart failure. Dr Yaranov explains, “When the heart slows down, the gut often does too. Feeling full quickly or unexplained nausea can be your body’s quiet signal that something’s off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Confusion or memory loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cardiologist emphasises that your brain detects reduced blood flow before you notice it, potentially causing cognitive issues such as memory loss and confusion. He explains, “Brain fog, trouble focusing, or forgetting simple things can happen when your heart isn’t pumping efficiently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difficulty sleeping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sleep problems can also act as early warning signs of heart failure. According to Dr Yaranov, “Restless nights, waking suddenly, or needing extra pillows can be more than ‘bad sleep’. It may be your heart asking for help.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Examples include soft drinks, chips, and many breakfast cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182372" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sugar_breakfast_cereal_642.jpg" alt="bowl of breakfast cereal" class="wp-image-182372 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sugar_breakfast_cereal_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sugar_breakfast_cereal_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182372" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Breakfast cereals are often highly processed from industrial ingredients and cosmetic additives. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAG0VXHH-64/"&gt;Petra Malaeru's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, we argue, is not a lack of willpower on the part of individuals but rather is primarily commercially driven – the result of a powerful industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01565-X/fulltext"&gt;first paper&lt;/a&gt; summarises the evidence, showing that ultra-processed foods are spreading globally. The share of ultra-processed foods in diets has climbed over decades in countries across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, it's been consistently high for decades (around 50% of daily energy). Ultra-processed foods are essentially the national diet. The same goes for Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, this paper shows diets high in ultra-processed foods induce overeating and are nutritionally poor: more sugars, saturated fat and energy density, less fibre and key  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals, and fewer whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, this paper summarises the health risks. A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01565-X/fulltext"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; we carried out, which included 104 long-term studies, found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses of these studies confirmed associations for obesity, type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, Crohn's disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="182359" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and early death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, it's not just about "too much sugar, salt and fat". &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7"&gt;Clinical &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15922"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; show that when adults eat diets heavy in ultra-processed foods, they consume about 500–800 extra calories per day, gain weight and fat mass, and eat more rapidly, when compared with eating a non-ultra-processed diet with the same proportions of macronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely because of higher energy density, tastiness, and soft textures that make overeating ultra-processed foods easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is clearly needed. However, the evidence is now strong enough to justify a global public health response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Policy options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext%2522%2522"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; outlines policy options for governments that wish to address the problem. Four stand out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Changing the products: reformulation – when sugar is swapped for sweeteners or fat is swapped for additives that provide a fat-like texture – does not solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, governments could set limits on selected additives and use "ultra-processed food markers" such as colours, flavours and non-sugar sweeteners (as well as high levels of sugar, fat and salt) to identify ultra-processed products for regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Fixing food environments: evidence-based policy options include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopting mandatory front-of-pack warning labels, which &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;work well&lt;/a&gt; to inform consumers and reduce purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;protecting children under 18&lt;/a&gt; – especially on digital platforms – from ultra-processed food marketing and extend protections beyond "kids' hours"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;taxing sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt; (by at least 20%) and selected ultra-processed foods; use revenue to subsidise fruits, vegetables and freshly prepared meals for lower-income households&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext"&gt;removing ultra-processed foods from schools&lt;/a&gt;, hospitals and other public institutions, limiting the share of ultra-processed foods on supermarket shelves, and curbing availability of ultra-processed foods near schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Curbing corporate power: governments could do more to regulate companies' portfolios and monitor and constrain the proportion of sales from ultra-processed foods; strengthen competition policy and consider tax reforms that curb excessive market power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Addressing subsidies and supply chains: governments could redirect agricultural subsidies away from monoculture commodity ingredients for ultra-processed foods (such as corn, soy and sugar), and align environmental policies (on issues such as plastics reduction or water use) with nutrition goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success will come from tailored, coordinated packages – there's no silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Countering the ultra-processed food industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our third &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01567-3/fulltext"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; asks why ultra-processed foods are taking over human diets and how to mobilise a global public health response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer: address corporate power and profitability. Ultra-processing food is the food sector's most profitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-food-is-harming-mens-health-in-three-key-ways"&gt;Ultra-Processed Food Is Harming Men's Health in Three Key Ways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest transnationals sit atop global supply, marketing and lobbying networks that expand markets, shape science and public debate, and block regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182375" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/supermarket_shelves_processed_food_642.jpg" alt="supermarket shelves stocked with processed foods" class="wp-image-182375 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/supermarket_shelves_processed_food_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/supermarket_shelves_processed_food_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182375" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Markets are heavily shaped by transnational brands.

&lt;li&gt;disrupt the ultra-processed food business model, by taxing ultra-processed foods production, mandating corporate plastics recycling, and redirecting resources to support healthy food producers and families&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect policymaking and science from interference, with conflict-of-interest safeguards and clear rules of engagement for industry. We should end reliance on industry self-regulation and use public policy and law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build coalitions to advocate to policymakers and drive policy change, from legal support to strategic communications.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study, published by researchers at the University of California, Riverside, revisited the link between an emerging health risk and heart disease, uncovering alarming new details, according to a &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/11/18/microplastics-hit-male-arteries-hard" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/polyamide-microplastics-study-rat-ingestion/" target="_blank"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; — plastic particulate matter measuring 5 millimeters or smaller, often invisible to the naked eye — were not identified until &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/what-are-microplastics-oceans-harmful/" target="_blank"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, researchers have studied both their prevalence in the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-in-soil-impact-agriculture/" target="_blank"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; and their impact on it, &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/plastic-pollution-in-forests-india/" target="_blank"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-human-health-guide/" target="_blank"&gt;human health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked microplastics and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastic-in-arterial-buildup-heart-attack-patients/" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. The new research, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025006890#ak005" target="_blank"&gt;Environment International&lt;/a&gt;, drilled down on that connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied the effects of microplastics on mice, exposing them to daily levels equivalent to standard human exposure. They determined microplastics "dramatically worsened atherosclerosis" in several of the mice — but only male subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-9303ec5561ff8c22b537c317556e7f16 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-9303ec5561ff8c22b537c317556e7f16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-15d3260720f689ff3e28d7054970e669 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-15d3260720f689ff3e28d7054970e669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7ae0ee2aea4d44cff37c7d3ad23acb1e theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-7ae0ee2aea4d44cff37c7d3ad23acb1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-1c3cb600d72eeb104d5fa5cc9258453e theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-1c3cb600d72eeb104d5fa5cc9258453e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-4a04f2ad6c5f9de7f19edfa466e5c4cc theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-4a04f2ad6c5f9de7f19edfa466e5c4cc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-77faca96699e5fa799fba10c6fc66842 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-77faca96699e5fa799fba10c6fc66842"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-70e58d09baad5a27ef683ee5468edca2 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-70e58d09baad5a27ef683ee5468edca2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say something "is everywhere" is typically understood to be &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperbole" target="_blank"&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-1104095078" data-theco-trackid="600611" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;	&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-are-everywhere-biologist-richard-thompson/" target="_blank"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; were first discovered by a marine biologist, leading scientists to discover that the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastic-pollution-study-global-trend/" target="_blank"&gt;oceans are awash&lt;/a&gt; in this pervasive form of &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tag/plastic/" target="_blank"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; pollution. However, they're also in &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/microplastics-soil-crops-agriculture-study/" target="_blank"&gt;the soil&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn contaminates the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/nanoplastics-soil-plant-absorption-study/" target="_blank"&gt;food we grow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/nanoplastics-in-farm-animal-cells/" target="_blank"&gt;meat we consume&lt;/a&gt;. They're also airborne, meaning we breathe &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/airborne-nanoplastics-microplastics/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastic-tainted air&lt;/a&gt; indoors and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-569803b7369ddae7d46c610c4fade592 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-569803b7369ddae7d46c610c4fade592"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If microplastics were harmless, this pollution would still be a problem — but in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/how-microplastics-affect-heart-health/" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, traces of the contaminant have been found in human &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-semen-fertility-study/" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive systems&lt;/a&gt;, and research has linked exposure to microplastics to certain &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/microplastics-endometrial-cancer-research-women/" target="_blank"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-about-it"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever," said lead author Changcheng Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Research into microplastics is indeed critical, and new information on how microplastics affect the environment and living organisms is routinely studied and published — but acting on these findings on a &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/global-plastic-treaty-negotiations-fail/" target="_blank"&gt;global scale&lt;/a&gt; takes time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals can take several steps to reduce their direct exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/plastic-takeout-containers-microplastics-college-students/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, even if, as Zhou observed, it is "nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-3692d7861b1e4080054af2e2d4354483 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-3692d7861b1e4080054af2e2d4354483"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He advised &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" target="_blank"&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/avoid-single-use-items-when-you-travel/" target="_blank"&gt;single-use plastic&lt;/a&gt; items, and replacing your most-used things with &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" target="_blank"&gt;plastic-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; is also effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhou also recommended avoiding &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/single-use-plastic-danger-human-health-water-bottles/" target="_blank"&gt;plastic water bottles&lt;/a&gt;, a major source of microplastic exposure, as well as eschewing &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/ditch-plastic-food-containers/" target="_blank"&gt;plastic food containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Her health significantly declined over the years as she dealt with a slew of symptoms, including daily chronic pain, nausea and vomiting. For the past 10 years, she’s also been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), being fed through IVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My bowel acts as if it’s blocked but there’s nothing actually blocking it. It’s just the nerves don’t work so, as gross as this is, my stools would back up so much that I would throw it up or drain out my tummy,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/25yearold-australian-woman-plans-to-take-her-own-life/news-story/23449344e21219d5428d41ccc8cd741f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:News AU;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;News AU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had feeding tubes placed in me and I was still vomiting and then we discovered that my stomach wasn’t emptying so I was put on TPN,” she continued. “Because of the line straight into your bloodstream, if you get an infection it turns to sepsis really quickly which is very, very, dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until Annaliese turned 18 and transitioned from her pediatric facility to the general hospital that she was finally diagnosed. She learned that she had &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22781-autoimmune-autonomic-ganglionopathy#:~:text=Autoimmune%20autonomic%20ganglionopathy%20%28AAG%29%20is,dizzy%20when%20you%20stand%20up." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy&lt;/a&gt;, a rare neurological disease that damages the nerves that control heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 22, Annaliese was told that her condition was terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese now has multi-organ failure and has survived sepsis 25 times. Her strong medications have caused her to develop severe osteoporosis. She’s fractured her spine in four places, cracked her sternum in half and has nearly crushed her heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steroids have also caused necrosis — a condition where the blood supply to her bones has failed — resulting in her teeth blackening and starting to fall out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Annaliese Holland&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was so miserable,” she said. “You can’t change it so you have to just deal with it really. Even though there’s beautiful moments in my days, they are exhausting and long. I’m in chronic debilitating pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I missed out on formals, graduations, my 18th, 21st [birthdays], they were all in hospitals being really sick. All my friends, they’re having babies, getting engaged, married. Everyone’s life is moving and I’m just stuck. I’m not living. I’m surviving every day, which is tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Play now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese said her disease is like “walking on a field of landmines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It got to the point where she now no longer wants to endure the pain, sharing with her family that she wants to “die on my own terms” with medical aid in dying. What solidified her decision was seeing herself in the mirror one day while hospitalized and not even recognizing herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t me and I was so exhausted,” she said. “Life for me now is getting up each day doing what I need to do medically, taking the painkillers, trying to get through the day, just to go to bed and do it all again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have the most incredible team of doctors and nurses who have watched what I have been through and I told them I don’t want this anymore,” she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea is heartbreaking for her parents and sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese’s mother, Armanda, said she’s always hoping for a miracle but she “knows realistically what challenges” her daughter faces. But her father, Patrick, told the outlet that he’s seen her overcome every setback and knows she can get past the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time she goes to the hospital, she fights for her own life,” Patrick said, holding back tears. “The amount of times Annie has been in hospital and on her deathbed… to have to sit there and watch her go through it … but she is amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember talking to my dad in the kitchen one night and I said, ‘Dad, I’ve had enough.’ And he went, ‘So you’re giving up?’” Annaliese shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annaliese said the moment that helped her dad come to terms with her decision was when she was in the hospital after being resuscitated by doctors. She pleaded with him, “Dad, please let me go. I will not hate you if you let me go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘If this happens again, I don’t want anything. And please know that in my heart, you letting me go and saying no to treatment…I’m happy with and that’s what I want,’” she recalled, bursting into tears. “He turned to me and goes, ‘I don’t know how you do it and I totally understand that you’ve had enough.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;news.com.au/YouTube&lt;/p&gt; Annaliese Holland&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, three weeks after speaking to psychologists and going through the qualification process, Annaliese was approved for voluntary assisted dying (VAD), which she calls her “safety blanket” and a weight off her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical aid in dying (MAID) is legal in every state in Australia for those who are terminally ill, mentally competent adults. MAID or VAD are different from euthanasia — which is illegal — because the patients themselves administer prescribed drugs to end their lives, rather than a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s so weird to be happy, but I was so happy when I found out I was approved, I was crying,” Annaliese said. “It’s hard because for me I am in pain and then I am at peace, but then I put the pain onto my family. You have this battle in your head of not wanting to hurt them so I will put some thought into how it will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, I don’t want to have to wake up every day with anxiety about the pain that I know is ahead for me. The pain of starving to death when they can’t feed me anymore, or the horror of sepsis. Knowing I can go when the time is right is just a huge relief,” she explained. “I feel so lucky that I do have this choice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds, “It’s one of the bravest things you could ever do, to say I want VAD. It’s not giving up. You’ve had enough and you fought bloody hard."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/25-year-old-terminal-illness-medical-aid-in-dying-11851857" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>aol.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 23:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5zSndCSUpxSnY5VTdJckFRYkw2eGwxb0JVQkt1YThqM19KLTE2MXFhUzE2a0xZUnByVEpIX3BlenNzbV9IaEFyMVREcFRuclE5RjVBUTZHTXN5Q3loNHlKdk1RY1B0R0UwMGFYNHhfN3Y</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现多动症和早晨皮质醇之间复杂的遗传联系- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/researchers-uncover-complex-genetic-ties-between-adhd-and-morning-cortisol/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests the connection between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the body’s primary stress hormone, cortisol, is not one of direct cause and effect. Instead, the two appear to share a complex genetic foundation, pointing toward common biological pathways that regulate arousal and behavior. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2025.107587" target="_blank"&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, helps refine scientific understanding of the physiological underpinnings of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. For some time, researchers have investigated its relationship with the body’s stress response system, formally known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This system’s main product is cortisol, a hormone that follows a natural daily rhythm, typically peaking in the morning to promote wakefulness and declining throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this system also governs general arousal levels, which are thought to be regulated differently in individuals with ADHD, scientists have explored whether cortisol levels might be linked to the condition. Some previous analyses of multiple studies indicated that people with ADHD, particularly youths, tend to have lower baseline levels of morning cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results across individual studies have been inconsistent, leaving the nature of this relationship ambiguous. It was not clear if cortisol differences contributed to ADHD, if ADHD itself altered cortisol regulation, or if another factor linked them both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, a team of researchers from institutions in Brazil and Denmark turned to genetics. Led by scientists at the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, the group used large-scale genetic data to dissect the biological connection between ADHD and morning cortisol levels. Their approach was designed to move beyond simple correlation and test for causal links and shared genetic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first employed a powerful statistical method known as Mendelian Randomization. This technique uses genetic variants as a proxy for an exposure, in this case, morning cortisol levels. Because a person’s genes are randomly assigned at conception and generally remain fixed, this method can help determine if an exposure causes an outcome without the confounding influence of environmental or lifestyle factors. The analysis drew on genetic data from two massive datasets: one for ADHD that included over 225,000 people and one for morning cortisol levels from over 25,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying seven different Mendelian Randomization models, the team found no evidence of a causal relationship in either direction. Genetically predicted morning cortisol levels did not appear to increase the likelihood of having ADHD. Similarly, a genetic predisposition for ADHD did not seem to cause alterations in morning cortisol levels. This result suggested that a simple, direct causal link was unlikely and that a more complex connection might exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team searched for evidence of pleiotropy, a phenomenon where the same genes influence multiple, seemingly unrelated traits. They started by conducting a global genetic correlation analysis, which scans the entire genome to see if the genetic factors for ADHD and cortisol overlap on a broad scale. This analysis did not find a significant overall correlation, indicating that on a genome-wide level, the two traits do not share substantial genetic influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation then shifted to a more fine-grained approach. Using a technique called Local Analysis of Variant Association, the researchers zoomed in on 2,495 specific segments of the genome to search for localized regions of genetic overlap. Here, they made a key discovery. They identified two distinct genomic regions, one on chromosome 5 and another on chromosome 22, where the genetics of ADHD and morning cortisol were significantly linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of these links was bidirectional. The region on chromosome 5 showed a negative correlation, meaning that genetic variants associated with a higher likelihood of ADHD were also associated with lower morning cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the region on chromosome 22 showed a positive correlation, where genetic variants linked to a higher likelihood of ADHD were tied to higher morning cortisol levels. This mixture of positive and negative associations in different parts of the genome helps explain why the global analysis found no overall effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genes located within these two regions, such as RASGRF2 and TRIOBP, have previously been implicated in a range of psychiatric conditions, cognitive functions, and risk-taking behaviors. An additional analysis designed to pinpoint single genetic markers associated with both traits identified one variant located within a gene called ZNF652-AS1. This marker has also been connected in other research to behaviors related to impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see how these genetic predispositions play out in people, the researchers conducted a final analysis in an independent group of 1,660 Brazilian adults, some with ADHD and some without. For each person, they calculated a polygenic score, which summarizes an individual’s genetic tendency toward higher or lower morning cortisol. The team then tested if this score was associated with having an ADHD diagnosis or other co-occurring psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortisol polygenic score was not directly associated with having an ADHD diagnosis on its own. It was, however, associated with the presence of other conditions known as externalizing disorders. A higher genetic predisposition for morning cortisol was linked to a greater likelihood of having a substance use disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers statistically accounted for the presence of these co-occurring conditions, a new pattern emerged: a lower cortisol polygenic score was then associated with ADHD. This finding suggests the link between cortisol genetics and ADHD may be partly masked or mediated by related behavioral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study’s results argue against a direct causal pathway between cortisol and ADHD. Instead, they support a model of localized pleiotropy, where specific sets of genes influence both the body’s arousal systems and the behaviors characteristic of ADHD. The researchers propose that these findings align with an “inverted U-shaped” model of physiological regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this view, optimal functioning occurs at a moderate level of arousal, and deviations in either direction, resulting in either too low or too high cortisol, could be associated with ADHD-related traits. This perspective reframes ADHD not just as a disorder of attention, but as a condition involving broader systemic dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations. The large genetic datasets used for the initial analyses were drawn predominantly from individuals of European ancestry, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. The polygenic score analysis in the Brazilian sample highlighted this, as the associations were primarily detected in the subgroup of participants with greater European ancestry. The clinical sample for the polygenic score analysis was also modest in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by examining these genetic links in larger and more diverse populations. Integrating genetic data with direct, repeated measurements of cortisol levels in individuals over time would also help to clarify how these shared genetic factors influence the body’s hormonal dynamics from day to day. Such work would continue to illuminate the complex biological interplay that contributes to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2025.107587" target="_blank"&gt;Shared biological pathways linking ADHD and cortisol variability are related to externalizing behaviors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by João K.N.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Texas — Texas’ top agriculture official is urging horse owners to keep a close eye on their animals after an outbreak of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 (EHV-1) was linked to the recent World Championship Barrel Racing Finals in the Waco area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning led to at least one Houston-area horse arena closing for the time being. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/commprecinct2.org/posts/pfbid02tP2athdDimvHYFuT1iPxNyhUjwJQYSxDc4MYHPqtuZ8Nv3VhZyCu1XQHoRGSmFPyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;According to Montgomery County Precinct 2 Commissioner Charlie Riley&lt;/a&gt;, the Magnolia Horse Arena was closed "out of an abundance of caution" due to the EHV-1 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montgomery County Precinct 1 Commissioner Robert Walker announced that the Willis Ag Arena would be closed due to the outbreak, too. All scheduled events were canceled, and the matter will be reassessed on Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how many horses have died as a result of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and the Texas Department of Agriculture issued a public alert Wednesday, asking anyone who attended, transported horses to, or was near the event from Nov. 5-9 to act quickly and take extra precautions. Miller emphasized that even small changes can be early signs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This virus can spread fast, it can be deadly, and the earliest signs are often so subtle they’re easy to miss. That’s why monitoring your horses right now is critical. The quicker we identify a potential case, the better chance we have to protect not only our animals, but the entire Texas equine community," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly aggressive strain of EHV-1 has now been confirmed by Central Texas veterinarians. The department said horse owners who attended the Waco event, whose horses have mingled with those that went, or who attended any large equine gathering nearby in the last 14 days, should be on alert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of EHV-1 can range from fever or nasal discharge to depression, stumbling, weakness or loss of tail tone, and even abortions in pregnant mares. The virus can spread directly by nose-to-nose contact or through the air when infected horses cough or sneeze, and can also travel on equipment, tack, buckets, and even human hands or clothing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department recommends isolating horses that attended the event for at least 14 days, suspending all event travel for exposed horses, disinfecting all shared equipment, monitoring temperatures twice daily, and contacting a veterinarian immediately if fever or other symptoms appear. Any horse showing respiratory or neurological symptoms should be isolated right away, and handlers should use protective gear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller urged the Texas horse community to act fast.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m asking every local horse rider, roper, trainer, and breeder to do their part today. Check your horses twice a day, isolate any exposed animals, tighten up your biosecurity, and call your vet the moment something looks off. If we work together and take this seriously, we can get ahead of this outbreak and keep our horses and our state’s $12.3 billion equine industry safe," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners are also advised to keep detailed records and stay in touch with their veterinarian and state authorities for updates.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Ever since the mRNA Covid vaccines were approved in 2020, experts have looked at flu as one of the next logical applications for the technology. No country has approved an mRNA flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6964ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said Pfizer’s mRNA flu vaccine could be “a game-changer,” potentially providing a closer match to the strains in any given flu season. One big reason flu shots aren’t as effective as they can be is because they aren’t a good match for the circulating virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0637c4" class="body-graf"&gt;Because it takes months to manufacture a traditional flu shot, Creech said, scientists must choose the strains to include in the vaccine about six to eight months before flu season begins. Developing an mRNA shot is typically faster, which could allow those decisions to be made later in the year — and give scientists more flexibility to pivot if the circulating strain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc03ef" class="body-graf"&gt;“There remains a significant need for improved approaches to prevent influenza,” Creech said. The trial results, he said, provide “proof” that the mRNA shot has an advantage over traditional flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f551e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pfizer, however, may face an uphill battle to get the new vaccine approved, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99fbbc" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085"&gt;downplayed the benefits of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and has singled out vaccines made with mRNA as particularly dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312"&gt;calling the mRNA Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” Several states have introduced legislation to ban mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60c9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;In August, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding into mRNA vaccine research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df072e" class="body-graf"&gt;In May, Moderna, which also makes an mRNA Covid vaccine, withdrew its application seeking approval for its combination flu and Covid mRNA shot after the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;asked for more data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-188133" class="body-graf"&gt;“Despite all the advantages of mRNA, I’m concerned that our current DHHS has no or little interest in the science,” Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c806e" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1461e9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kelly Lindert, Pfizer’s vice president of clinical research and development, said in an email that the company is “in discussion with health authorities on the path to licensure of mRNA influenza vaccines.” She declined to comment on the timeline for submission or approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f57c82" class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial, funded by Pfizer, compared the company’s mRNA shot to Fluzone, one of the most widely used seasonal flu vaccines in the U.S. More than 18,000 adults, most of them in the U.S., were randomly assigned to get either shot during the 2022-2023 flu season. Other trial sites included South Africa and the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ace139" class="body-graf"&gt;The trial found Pfizer’s shot cut flu-like illnesses by 34.5% compared to Fluzone — 57 cases in the mRNA group versus 87 cases in the Fluzone group. Nearly all infections were caused by two common influenza A strains: H3N2 and H1N1. The Pfizer vaccine also protected against two influenza B strains, the Victoria strain and the Yamagata strain. The Yamagata strain fell out of circulation during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48917d" class="body-graf"&gt;Both flu shots caused side effects, including arm pain and fatigue, though they were more common in people who got the mRNA flu shot compared to the traditional vaccine. A small percentage — 5.6% — of people who got the mRNA vaccine reported fevers, compared to 1.7% in the traditional flu shot group. Most side effects were mild to moderate and went away within 1 to 2 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef7bb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Creech said it’s not surprising that the mRNA vaccine caused more side effects, given that it generated a stronger immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-951429" class="body-graf"&gt;“In some ways, this is like training for a race,” Creech said. “We may have a little bit of muscle soreness or fatigue after a training run, but by having a little bit of discomfort then, we can avoid overwhelming fatigue or soreness during the race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f041f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Lindert said it’s plausible people are reporting more side effects due to “the cascade of events from the activation of the immune response.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccee36" class="body-graf"&gt;“The relationship between side effects and immune responses is the source of ongoing discussion in the scientific community,” Lindert said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb9a97" class="body-graf"&gt;Moderna is also still working on a stand-alone mRNA flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1f0ca" class="body-graf"&gt;In June, the company reported results from a late-stage trial in older adults, finding its mRNA flu shot was about 27% more effective than an approved flu shot made by GSK. The company said people who got its shot had side effects that were similar to those seen with other flu vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed2dcc" class="body-graf"&gt;Creech said “not all mRNA vaccines are created the same,” adding that it’s not surprising Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots could have different efficacy levels and side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-577d84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Moderna said the company plans to file for approval for its stand-alone flu vaccine by January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 22:02:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOelQ2N2tfX3ZkY1Y0RVdrWUx5WnZTQkRIRFdabkhuRjVLUHd5ZDI4TDd1RDYtSFFxTkFpZUlyTmYxMnJ2ZW0xOHhDaG1lV2xyb0FvTnRSd1NVN0k0THRZb3RPUWdQYzE4ZVVZUy15QUhzWTl3Ri0zX0xiNE1VWWVrZVZYZU9PeDJybGMxMG1HRzlrbXd6RVd6Z1puVXNMREZMZ25zQ0VCUWhUOWNJUjFmZm54UjRtbzZFajA4T1ZBbGdWQdIBVkFVX3lxTE1DeDFad1A1ZDBva1pEQXptZGVDZl9lZDVMZV9hV296ZE5TdV9nejhDMFJXakl1dF9sNDFPeU81VFZqajVuNUZFdk5lb2pMSFFreGYxZk53</guid></item><item><title>研究人员正在寻找减肥药物副作用的解决方案- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5611473/researchers-are-looking-for-solutions-for-side-effects-of-weight-loss-drugs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are highly effective for weight loss. But researchers at the Society for Neuroscience meeting say they are only beginning to understand the drugs' effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are helping millions of Americans shed pounds, but these drugs affect the brain in ways that can cause nausea and other side effects. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on researchers at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego who are trying to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: They're called GLP-1 drugs, and they mimic a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion. Warren Yacawych of the University of Michigan says, unfortunately, nearly half the people who take the drugs feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARREN YACAWYCH: They lose weight, which is a positive thing, but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could suppress appetite without making people queasy. He says they focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YACAWYCH: The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center. It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The second area monitors food intake and tells you when you're full. So the team altered mice in a way that allowed GLP-1 to reach the area involved in feeling full but not the vomit center. The mice didn't get sick, but Yacawych says they also didn't get thin - probably because certain cells in the vomit center are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YACAWYCH: And so it's very challenging, we think, right now to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: One possible workaround came from researchers at the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone oxytocin, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick. Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst. Derek Daniels of the University at Buffalo says this could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEREK DANIELS: If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, you can understand why that would be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: To understand how GLP-1 drugs affect thirst, Daniels and a team began studying rats, and they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANIELS: We had a happy accident in the lab, and the happy accident involved a rat called a Brattleboro rat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: This animal is thirsty pretty much all the time, except when it gets a GLP-1 drug. This led the team to the brain area causing this change. Daniels says that discovery could be important in efforts to reduce side effects from GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANIELS: It now gives an opportunity to maybe design drugs that will target the good places and not the bad places. And I would think of a place that suppresses thirst as a bad place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Another team found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a place that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a brain area involved in emotion and the reward system. Ali Guler of the University of Virginia says when GLP-1 is delivered to this brain area in mice, it doesn't affect their appetite for healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALI GULER: But if you do the same treatment and provide them with a rewarding food like a burger, the animals have actually a reduced intake of this food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: It's the mouse equivalent of choosing a salad instead of dessert. And Guler says scientists should be able to develop versions of GLP-1 drugs that work the same way - by targeting the reward system while avoiding brain areas involved in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GULER: If we are able to do this, then we can use it for different types of treatments, such as substance use disorder like alcoholism or drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Doctors and researchers have already observed that people taking GLP-1 drugs for weight loss or diabetes tend to consume less alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF AYANNA SONG, "GIRLFRIEND")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But apart from exercise and healthy diet, there is something else that fuels the brain. That aspect is social connections. Yes, that is right! Social disconnection stands as a hidden brain-damaging factor, which causes memory problems, and can even shrink your brain! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9750173/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicates that social connections between people, determine how their brains age and function. Social connections beyond emotional benefits, help people stay mentally alert, while reducing inflammation and protecting their brain size and memory storage capacity.

The researchers analysed 50,000 participants to establish that loneliness creates a higher danger for developing depression, poor physical health, and weakens immune system function. The problem extends beyond elderly populations because young and middle-aged people with lower incomes, and women face elevated risks of social isolation. Health professionals now recognise loneliness as a major public health issue, because it exists as a widespread silent condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Social connection and brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who maintain strong social bonds through regular interaction, develop an effective defense system against cognitive deterioration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have proven that social participation builds up cognitive reserve, which enables the brain to handle aging changes and injuries. People who stay socially active, demonstrate superior mental flexibility and better memory functions and learning abilities, than those who live in isolation. The brain develops better problem-solving abilities and emotional control through social interactions, that involve multiple brain regions. People who maintain various social relationships between close friends, and family, achieve the best brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Loneliness and increased inflammation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical effects of loneliness extend beyond emotional distress, because it triggers measurable changes in body stress systems, and inflammation responses. Research indicates that people who experience prolonged social isolation and loneliness, develop elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which are inflammatory markers linked to chronic diseases. The inflammatory markers increase heart disease and diabetes risks, while simultaneously causing damage to brain cells and blood vessels. People who maintain social connections show reduced inflammation levels and better stress management abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The link between loneliness and shrinking brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11089178/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; using brain imaging techniques has validated psychologists' earlier predictions that social isolation leads to brain tissue reduction in areas responsible for memory, and thinking functions. Research conducted in 2024 demonstrated that people who experienced ongoing loneliness, developed smaller brain areas including frontal white matter and hippocampus, which serves as a critical memory storage center. The research results showed that loneliness directly affects brain structure, even after scientists controlled age-related factors, health conditions and depression symptoms. The brain shrinkage effect from loneliness could explain why lonely people develop higher risks of developing dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Social isolation leads to memory loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research conducted over multiple years, demonstrates that severe social detachment accelerates memory deterioration in people. Research shows that social isolation leads to accelerated memory and language skill deterioration in both male and female participants, when compared to their socially engaged counterparts. The evidence demonstrates that social isolation actively causes cognitive deterioration, instead of being a result of poor memory function. Older adults who experience loneliness, perform poorly on memory tests, and show reduced verbal skills and decreased attention span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How social connection protects and enhances the brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social connection stands as a powerful brain-protective factor, because it activates multiple brain regions during conversations and shared activities, which maintains neural network flexibility and strength. Social interactions bring down stress hormones while simultaneously increasing brain-protective substances, including oxytocin and dopamine. People who participate in social activities on a regular basis stimulate brain growth factors, which support the creation of new brain cells through a process known as neuroplasticity. People who participate in group activities such as volunteering, clubs or digital communities, experience mental stimulation and emotional support, which helps them maintain brain health during their senior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Practical steps to protect brain health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step to defend memory and brain vitality, requires understanding how social isolation and loneliness create health risks. Daily social interaction through any small activity, helps people fight against loneliness. You can fight loneliness by making daily contact with friends through phone calls, and by participating in group activities and local community volunteer work. Activities that challenge your mind during social events, such as book clubs, games and discussions, provide the most benefit. People need to develop strong relationships with others, while making social interaction their top priority, because these factors protect their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that social connections serve as an essential, yet underestimated tool to defend memory and brain volume throughout entire life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8gFBVV95cUxQaHFVa1J5aGhoT1BCc0VNejVyRzBST1VUVjAzZ2FCNnBoWllUVV85cVZhMHpSTFFJY3ZOQzgyN3hCWmJPSHM3VjE3ekVMVmczLXlPQS1sN0pjYkRFeDI2ekFvb2d4N2ZQNzJCZGROSHRPOEF2MHhsY1AwTUV3aVFib09YOHFLMnltTEZ1NHJTWU52RmIxM0hjSXMzVnZOa2NBM012TXFYOW1UYWkyLWlHVUxxcTVNaHBuWHJYMTduM3BlRjlYLXVSbVRKMVpVMk9wU1lPMGJjbTl3d2NUN0w5a0gxa2hpamFyM29KSkN4LWtYQQ</guid></item><item><title>女性似乎比男性收回的论文更少—但为什么？ -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03796-w</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_51731504.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_51731504.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Woman taking notes in lab with lab equipment in the foreground and background." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_51731504.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Are women more careful about their research than men?

A new study finds that women’s names filled just 23% of author slots in a sample of nearly 900 retracted articles published in medical journals between 2008 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really interesting, creative and robust study,” says Curt Rice, who promotes publishing literacy at the Publishing Unlocked project in Oslo, Norway. “The article invites us to dig into issues like negotiations about authorship and the likelihood of scrutiny.” The findings were reported on 19 November in &lt;i&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00509-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03796-w/d41586-025-03796-w_50653532.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;Study author Paul Sebo, an internal medicine specialist and researcher at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, used an artificial intelligence tool that infers whether authors are male or female based on their first names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found women’s names in 16.5% of first-author slots and 12.7% of last-author slots for the retracted papers. By contrast, an earlier study that used a similar tool for predicting author gender found that women accounted for 41–45% of first authors and 26–33% of last authors in all articles from the same selection of journals across the same time frame&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk and reward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the results is fraught. The gender-prediction tools used are imperfect. They do not capture non-binary identities, for example, and can be less accurate with non-Western names than Western ones. But in a manual check of 200 names, Sebo found no mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the findings themselves don’t come with a clear explanation. In an e-mail to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, Sebo wrote that his suspicion is that the disparity stems from how “women are still underrepresented in senior academic roles, lead fewer projects, and therefore may be less exposed to the kinds of responsibilities (and risks) that are more commonly associated with retractions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The case for removing fluoride from the drinking water supply just got weaker. Research out today shows no link between water fluoridation and declining cognition in children or adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the education and medical records of a large, nationally representative group of Americans. They found no evidence that water fluoridation was associated with lower test scores in high school or lower cognition scores later in life. The findings seem to undermine one of the most common arguments made against adding fluoride to people’s drinking water, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If fluoride lowers your IQ, then we should see lower test scores in places where they fluoridate the water. And we didn’t, at all,” lead author John Warren, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Minnesota’s Minnesota Population Center, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The fluoride bogeyman&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among some groups, water fluoridation has long been blamed for a range of health problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longtime antiscience crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science/index.html"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that fluoride is causing widespread IQ loss and increased bone cancer, for instance. And since taking over as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under the second Trump administration, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-will-tell-cdc-to-stop-recommending-fluoride-in-drinking-water"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that he will tell the CDC to no longer recommend water fluoridation on a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the most boisterous claims made about fluoride are unsubstantiated by the current data, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html"&gt;supposed cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there has been a more &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-does-the-evidence-say-about-fluoride-lowering-iq-2000548298"&gt;substantial scientific debate&lt;/a&gt; over whether water fluoridation can affect children’s IQ. A review published earlier this January and conducted by scientists at the National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a possible link between lower IQ levels in children and greater fluoride exposure, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Study researcher John Warren notes, as others &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828430"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;, that this review largely focused on studies looking at much higher and potentially toxic levels of fluoride exposure than typically seen in the U.S., however. And in general, there’s only been limited research examining this possible link among American children.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It really struck me that there was a problem with that meta-analysis,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A lack of harm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren and his colleagues believed they had access to data that could provide a clearer picture of the relationship between fluoride and cognition: the &lt;a href="https://edshareproject.org/data/hsb/about"&gt;High School and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; study. This project, initiated in the 1980s, collected reading, math, and vocabulary test scores from over 26,000 high school students across the country; a subset of surviving participants were also contacted as adults and asked to undergo medical evaluations, including tests of their cognition, up through age 60.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many people grow up in the towns and neighborhoods where they went to high school, especially in the 1980s. So the researchers cross-referenced other federal data on water fluoridation levels in the areas where the children went to school. This data was then used as a proxy for people’s exposure to fluoride as they were growing up. Though many parts of the U.S. had started regularly fluoridating their water by the early 1980s, plenty hadn’t or had adopted their own local standards, allowing the researchers to compare varying levels of fluoride exposure among neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, Warren’s team failed to find a negative association between relatively higher levels of fluoride in a town’s drinking water and high school children’s test scores; if anything, kids in the U.S. exposed to fluoridated water actually seemed to have slightly higher scores on average. This slight advantage faded by age 60, but the researchers still found no link between lower cognition in adults and fluoridated water exposure in childhood. They also found that few neighborhoods exceeded recommended fluoride levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“If [fluoride] lowers your IQ, which is supposed to be a permanent change, then you would expect lower cognition at age 60. But we didn’t find that,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0757"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The future of fluoridation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren notes this study only looked at the relationship between cognition and fluoride, so it alone can’t tell us whether water fluoridation is a net positive. But he points out that other research has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm"&gt;affirmed&lt;/a&gt; its benefits in improving dental health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are also aware that children’s test scores are an imperfect indicator of IQ. But they’re now conducting a similar study of children in Wisconsin, where they do have access to IQ test scores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is, these findings obviously undercut the rationale to remove fluoride from people’s drinking water. And while the researchers are planning to further study the topic, they argue it will take much stronger evidence than currently amassed to reasonably justify such a removal based on hypothetical concerns about IQ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we’re showing is that this IQ story—it doesn’t hold up in the United States in a representative sample at levels of fluoride that are actually relevant for policy discussion,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, reason is in short supply these days. Aside from RFK Jr.’s federal campaign, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/florida-2nd-state-ban-fluoride-public-drinking-water/story?id=121852274#:~:text=MORE:%20Utah%20becomes%201st%20state,last%20month%20to%20ban%20fluoride.&amp;amp;text=Commissioner%20Roberto%20Gonzalez%2C%20who%20sponsored,Control%20and%20Prevention%20(CDC)."&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJUYFjnnNk"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; have already passed legislation this year to ban water fluoridation, and still more &lt;a href="https://www.wrdw.com/2025/04/22/ga-docs-defend-fluoride-water-critics-seek-removal/"&gt;states and towns&lt;/a&gt; may soon follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fluoride might not be lowering anyone’s IQ. But the fear of it sure seems to be doing a number on some people’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

            The longstanding public health practice of adding fluoride to community drinking water is facing heavy scrutiny in the United States over questions about whether the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/health/fluoride-drinking-water-tooth-decay-risk-benefit"&gt;benefits outweigh the potential risks&lt;/a&gt;. But new research challenges recent claims about the risks of fluoride in drinking water — and instead suggests that it may have additional positive effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The heightened federal debate was spurred by a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/children-higher-fluoride-levels-lower-iqs-government-study"&gt;recent government study&lt;/a&gt; from the National Toxicology Program that concluded that high levels of fluoride exposure are linked to lower IQ in children, but that study evaluated fluoride exposures that were at least twice the federally recommended limits with notably “&lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/research/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride" target="_blank"&gt;insufficient data&lt;/a&gt;” to determine the effects of lower levels.

            The new study looked at more typical, recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water and instead found “robust evidence” that young people exposed to fluoride at these lower levels actually performed better on ​cognitive tests than their peers who did not have fluoride in their drinking water.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Rob Warren, lead author of the&lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz0757" target="_blank"&gt; study published in the journal Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, said he was “shocked” by the findings from the National Toxicology Program study and motivated to provide research that was more relevant to public policy decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I wouldn’t have done this work had it not been an empirical question that I didn’t think we had an answer to, of great immediate policy interest,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called fluoride “an industrial waste” and cited “IQ loss” in &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923" target="_blank"&gt;pledges&lt;/a&gt; to roll back federal recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/health/utah-fluoride-water-health"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; have become the first two states to ban the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Imagine testing some new drug for heart disease and the recommended dosage is 100 milligrams, and then your study compares people who get a million milligrams to people who get half a million milligrams. Well, that doesn’t tell you anything about the effect of getting 100 milligrams versus getting nothing,” Warren said. “That’s kind of the world we’re in with fluoride research. It’s important to know that if you get a toxic dose, really bad things happen to your body, but that’s not relevant for the public policy discussion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000a3b6nx4z11dz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Warren, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, leads a program that started in the US Department of Education and has followed a cohort of tens of thousands of people for more than four decades since their high school years in the 1980s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000b3b6n382fj10a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new study, he and other researchers used this data to overlay performance on mathematics, reading and vocabulary tests for a nationally representative sample of nearly 27,000 people with their exposure to fluoride in community drinking water based on historical data from HHS and the US Geological Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000c3b6ndjfrjd54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis assumed that individuals lived near their high school for their whole childhood and grouped them based on whether they would have been consistently exposed to recommended fluoride levels through community water fluoridation or natural occurrence of the mineral, consistently lacking exposure to fluoride, or partly exposed if their community changed their local fluoridation policy at some point during their childhood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000d3b6nj330uxia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Students who were exposed to fluoride for part of their childhood had higher test scores in high school than those who had no exposure to fluoride, and the difference was even greater for those who were exposed to fluoride for their whole childhood, the study found. Follow-up tests continued through 2021, when most participants had reached 60 years of age, and suggested that fluoride exposure also did not contribute to cognitive decline as participants aged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000e3b6nsoksqobb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive tests are not direct measures of IQ. There is a strong correlation, Warren says, but cognitive tests measure a mix of how well someone’s brain works along with the opportunities they’ve had to learn the material. He’s working on additional research that will directly assess the link between fluoride and IQ, with more precise measurements data about where the individuals lived during childhood, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000f3b6nf6ai9wmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/fluoride-removal-excess-cavities-study"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from this year estimated that removing fluoride from public water in the US would lead to 25.4 million excess decayed teeth in children and adolescents within five years, along with $9.8 billion in health care costs. The new study did not measure individual dental health, but experts say that pain from tooth decay can cause children to have trouble focusing in school or miss it completely — which could be a factor affecting cognitive test scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi6am3vi00003b6rapalhitu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. The practice of adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000g3b6noot334sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Dental Association and many experts have continued to support the practice of community water fluoridation, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendations. The agency cannot mandate that communities add fluoride to their water, but it considers 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to be the “optimal level.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi6ami4r00013b6royh0ivam@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the US Food and Drug Administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/fluoride-supplement-restrictions-fda"&gt;took action&lt;/a&gt; to restrict the use of prescription fluoride supplements. “There are better ways to protect children’s teeth than taking unapproved ingestible fluoride, which is now recognized to alter the gut microbiome,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release about the action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000h3b6ndmzr6c78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said it’s important to capture a more complete set of all sources of fluoride exposures, such as toothpaste and pesticides.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000i3b6niaguwh3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Population strategies – like fluoridation, like vaccination, like taking lead out of gasoline – they can be extraordinarily powerful. If you’ve got a safe and effective intervention, you can have a big impact on the health of populations,” he said. “But when you have a population strategy like fluoridation, the evidence about its safety and about its effectiveness has to be extraordinarily strong.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000j3b6nmt4unwfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in a &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aed4503" target="_blank"&gt;formal response&lt;/a&gt; to the new research that was also published in Science Advances on Wednesday, Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist with the Brown University School of Public Health, argues that the greater burden lies on proving the risk before ending a public health practice that has been successful for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000k3b6ndkl9lppx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Until clear evidence exists that water fluoridation lacks public health benefit or compelling evidence of harm at the level of fluoride exposure in fluoridated water, neither of which has occurred, it seems foolhardy to interfere with a long-established and well-recognized public health success,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi5yojmy000l3b6nhr53fqlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With due credit to the folk wisdom of Bert Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.’ Warren and colleagues move the needle a bit further into the ‘ain’t broke’ range.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Hundreds of videos on social media celebrate the benefits of dietary fiber and share recipes to help viewers get more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s even a term for trying to meet or exceed the recommended daily fiber intake: fibermaxxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fiber’s benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html"&gt;muscle-building protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, fiber isn’t sexy. It’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-markers-biomarkers-3d19f93573cf36698c7b946fee6e8d18"&gt;a carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; found in plants that your body can’t break down. It helps feed gut bacteria and move food through the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Folks don’t want to talk about it at a dinner party,” said Debbie Petitpain, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like material that feeds gut bacteria. It’s found in foods like oats, peas, beans, apples and carrots. Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water and moves food through the digestive system. It’s found in whole wheat flour, popcorn, wheat bran, nuts, green beans and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that fiber lowers cholesterol levels, regulates blood sugar and promotes weight loss, since high-fiber foods tend to make eaters feel more full. It may also protect against heart disease, diabetes, diverticulitis and colon cancer, according to the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Petitpain said rising use of GLP-1 weight loss drugs could be one reason for the renewed focus on fiber, since GLP-1s naturally slow digestion and fiber can prevent constipation. She said fiber has seen similar spikes in interest when people wanted to alleviate symptoms from high-fat diets like Atkins or keto.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How much fiber do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people in Western countries could use more fiber because their diets are low in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, said Sander Kersten, director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s guidelines, adults should aim for 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they consume. That’s about 25 grams of fiber for women and 38 grams for men each day. Petitpain said Americans generally only get about two-thirds of that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;For reference, 1 cup of raspberries contains 8 grams of fiber, while a banana contains 3.2 grams, according to the USDA. One-half cup of avocado contains 5 grams of fiber and 1 cup of lima beans contains 13.2 grams. Fiber One, a bran cereal, packs 18 grams of fiber into a 2/3-cup serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are good ways to increase fiber?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kersten said long-term studies about the benefits of fiber have looked at the consumption of whole foods and not &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;packaged products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with added fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way it is consumed as an additive and part of a diet that doesn’t contain a lot of fiber may be different than a naturally fiber-rich diet,” Kersten said. “You can eat a very processed, Western diet and consume foods that are enriched, but we don’t know if it confers the same benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole foods also help the body in other ways, Petitpain said. An apple contains 4.8 grams of fiber as well as water, vitamins and minerals, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some recommendations from the Mayo Clinic for adding fiber to your diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Choose a breakfast cereal with 5 grams or more of fiber a serving. Top it with a sliced banana or berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Choose breads with at least 2 grams of fiber per serving and try other grains like brown rice, whole-wheat pasta and quinoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— When baking, substitute whole-grain flour for white flour. Add wheat bran to muffins and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Try to eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily. If you eat canned fruit, make sure it’s canned in fruit juice and not syrup, and make sure canned vegetables are low in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Think twice about fibermaxxing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no defined upper limit for fiber intake, Kersten said. But increasing fiber can cause painful gas and bloating, especially if it’s done quicky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petitpain said people should increase their fiber intake gradually and drink plenty of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re feeding gut bacteria a food, and you can’t break it down. You rely on them, and if you give them second, third and fourth servings, there’s not enough of them to handle the extra load,” Petitpain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations should also be extra careful about their fiber intake, Petitpain said. People who are sensitive to gluten or allergic to foods like soy, shellfish or psyllium husk should read labels carefully since some foods with added fiber contain those ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Kersten questions the trend of focusing on one nutrient, whether it’s protein or fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need nutrients, we need foods. Ultimately, what you want to be striving for is a healthy diet, and you should choose foods that are considered to be an important part of a healthy diet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69nzmy00183b79jxunhd9p@published"&gt;I’m a 59-year-old gay man who had a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prostatectomy/about/pac-20385198"&gt;prostatectomy&lt;/a&gt; last year. I often receive aggressive, in-person flirtation from nice guys who obviously want to hook up casually. I owe them a warning, though.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69usp6002p3b794seao9jb@published"&gt;I desperately want to say yes (with precautions), but when do I tell them that I won’t get hard? I’m a passionate guy who enjoys a lot of things, and can still have wild, dry orgasms. Rejecting a blowjob comes off as rejecting the person. Mentioning my prostate cancer is a mood killer for a casual flirtation, but guys take it personally if we make out and I don’t get hard (even though I’m totally into it). I have a BiMix prescription, but even then, it’s not very portable, and I have to excuse myself awkwardly. What explanation do I owe them, and when? If it’s a dealbreaker, I’m wasting their time. Nobody seems to understand the sad side effects of this surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially lacking is how they impact gay sex. It sounds like you’re handling yours well, though. I don’t know for sure if your sign-off is a true reflection of how you’ve modified your sexual practices to your current abilities/interests, but if so: Bravo. You’re finding your way despite unfair limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmi69o02j001d3b79au1uvheh@published"&gt;If you are identifying as a bottom, it is completely reasonable to say upfront to potential partners that your dick is off limits, especially in casual encounters. Plenty of bottoms don’t get hard and/or put no focus on their penises during sex. This may disappoint some vers/top guys, but it won’t turn them all off. The negative reactions you’ve received about your lack of erection won’t necessarily be the norm—you may just have encountered a less-than-ideal sample. You’re nearly 60 years old, and it’s not uncommon for guys to have erectile issues as they get older. You don’t have to explain yourself or talk about your surgery. They can take it or leave it. This may result in rejection, but so might identifying as a total top in the event that one encounters another total top. It’s OK to not be for everyone, as exciting as it is to be pursued on a mass scale. Let people take their disappointment and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re doing what you’re doing, it doesn’t involve your dick being hard, and that is that. If you were to embark on regular sex with someone, whether a sex bud or a boyfriend, that’s when you might want to say something. You’d want to do it sometime around when you notice things getting less anonymous. At that point, your partner will have already liked what you’ve offered so far, and hopefully, will be happy just keeping things as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

Regarding that medication, it’s worth trying to break down the awkwardness you feel about that. It’s not ideal, but look at how amazing medical technology is! If someone really wants to play with your hard dick, there is a good chance that he will be accepting of whatever method you use to achieve it. Having to use drugs to achieve and maintain an erection can be humbling, but if you try to focus on the practicality, it may make it easier. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

I have tried to have many conversations about sex and they are hardly productive. I have tried many of the common suggestions for improving sexual frequency, having a set day/time for it, asking her what I can do to turn her on, etc. But every suggestion is brushed off, she wants our sex life to be spontaneous, or she just has to be in the right mood to do it, and while I respect her answers to these questions they don’t help me figure out what I can do to help. Over the past year, I know she has made an effort to increase frequency for me, and I GREATLY appreciate it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/wife-requests-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, there is a hitch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortage of human &lt;strong&gt;organs for transplants &lt;/strong&gt;has long been a pressing issue in the medical field, with thousands of patients waiting for lifesaving treatments. However, a recent breakthrough might offer a solution: genetically modified pig organs. Published November 13 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, a pioneering study has shown that it is possible to prevent human rejection of a pig organ, a remarkable first in the field of xenotransplantation. This study could revolutionize the future of organ donation and transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Significance of Preventing Pig Organ Rejection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have been exploring the potential of using &lt;strong&gt;pig organs in human transplants &lt;/strong&gt;as a solution to the ever-growing demand for organ donations. However, the body’s immune system has consistently rejected these foreign organs, making it a near-impossible solution. In a groundbreaking experiment led by &lt;strong&gt;Robert Montgomery at NYU Langone&lt;/strong&gt;, researchers successfully reversed the rejection of a pig kidney in a human subject not once, but twice, marking a historic step forward in xenotransplantation. “It’s a huge step forward,” Montgomery explains, emphasizing that this breakthrough could lead to the use of gene-edited pig organs as a viable alternative to human organs in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experiment, which took place &lt;strong&gt;over 61 days&lt;/strong&gt;, was performed on a brain-dead patient who was used as a model for the study. During this time, the transplanted kidney was rejected twice, but both instances were reversed using existing medications. This not only showcased the possibility of maintaining organ function, but also revealed the complexity of the body’s immune response to animal organs. Researchers were able to track these immune reactions in unprecedented detail, allowing them to adjust treatments to combat the rejection, an essential development for future &lt;strong&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montgomery further adds,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We could really get a very dense set of data points from doing biopsies, taking blood samples, body fluid samples and create an atlas of what that immune response looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The ability to track and intervene so precisely provides an invaluable foundation for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Understanding Xenotransplantation: A New Hope for Organ Shortages&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xenotransplantation&lt;/strong&gt;—the transplantation of animal organs into humans—has always been a controversial and challenging field. However, with increasing advancements in genetic engineering, scientists are beginning to believe that the long-held dream of using pig organs as a reliable substitute for human ones may finally be within reach. The pigs used in these experiments are genetically modified to make their organs more compatible with human physiology, reducing the likelihood of immediate rejection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, as detailed in the November 13&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/363501a0.epdf?sharing_token=fXa1zzypoUkEDhQy0NFkENRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MIT85q_BBLNftXSluJVj2bdf_cHiAkoNWMBjs1ajnIPUbCS8Z9axzYtdXk4Fx82Zy-W2-N48QV28Yveo5urolsUZml5igBGIXk1CUUsQxnhfohJDUx4gUb34WDLmKG-wapLHz37sKJ9OlNr-0qOWM7LhiJIk2fhv-Htt1b1iVmGA%3D%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.newscientist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; publication&lt;/a&gt;, marks a significant milestone. The transplant team observed the patient’s immune response closely, identifying the specific T cells and antibodies involved in the rejection process. These findings are vital for improving the survival of xenotransplanted organs in human bodies. The research also sheds light on the molecular mechanisms that drive these rejections, allowing scientists to intervene and prevent them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sixty-one days of stable renal function is novel proof of concept,” says Minnie Sarwal, a transplant surgeon from UCSF. She praises the study’s findings, emphasizing the durability of the genetically engineered pig kidney. &lt;strong&gt;The 61-day period &lt;/strong&gt;of stable &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/3d-printed-materials-enhance-organ-battery/" data-type="post" data-id="95923"&gt;organ &lt;/a&gt;function provides concrete evidence that pig organs can sustain life in humans, offering a beacon of hope for patients who may otherwise face lengthy waits for human organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Path Forward: Clinical Trials and Future Applications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the study was conducted on a single patient, the results are being hailed as a major step forward in the field of organ transplantation. Following this success, Montgomery’s team plans to test their immune suppression techniques in 20 additional patients to see if these results can be replicated. The hope is that the findings will not only improve the functionality of pig organs but also pave the way for their widespread use in human transplant surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Montgomery is optimistic about the future, stating, “As we move forward, I do believe that we will be in a position in the next few years where gene-edited pig organs will be an alternative to human organs.” This statement highlights the transformative potential of xenotransplantation, which could significantly reduce the number of patients waiting for life-saving transplants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the ability to reverse rejection could lead to more stable and long-lasting transplants, making pig organs a viable option for patients in dire need of replacements. The implications of this research extend beyond just kidneys and livers, with scientists eyeing other organs, such as hearts and lungs, for potential transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ethical Considerations and the Future of Animal Organs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the potential benefits of xenotransplantation are clear, there are still many ethical considerations to address. Concerns about animal welfare, genetic modification, and the long-term effects of animal-human organ transplants need careful thought and regulation. These ethical questions will play a crucial role in shaping the future of xenotransplantation, as society grapples with the idea of using genetically altered animals as sources of organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, with the success of the recent study, the conversation surrounding xenotransplantation is shifting from skepticism to cautious optimism. If these techniques can be refined and scaled, they could drastically reduce the number of deaths due to organ shortages. The results of this study provide a glimpse into a future where genetically engineered animal organs could save lives—if not tomorrow, then in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from the American Psychological Association now directly ties short form video content with significantly diminished mental health. In short — pun intended — it’s rotting brains.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have focused mainly on TikTok, which has limited the generalizability of findings across platforms. Since short form video content is now ubiquitous across social media (even LinkedIn is getting in on it, if any further proof of its spread is needed), so limiting studies to just one platform doesn’t paint a clear picture. Therefore, this study includes data from 98,299 participants across 71 studies and examines short form video’s effects on viewers beyond the progenitor platform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study examines engagement and attempted to find more nuanced insights than in previous studies and even assesses cognitive and mental health indices to identify specific health domains associated with short form video ingestion. The study also looks at age and offers findings into the differences of how this type of content affects youths and adults. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings are definitive. The study saw that heavy short form video consumption is directly associated with diminished cognitive functions, particularly a person’s ability to pay attention and control their inhibitions. In both younger and older age groups, higher ingestion of short form video (SFV) content is died to poorer attention spans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand some of how these findings occur, the researchers reference the “dual theory of habituation and sensitization” from Groves and Thompsons’s study from 1970 called &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0029810" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Habituation: A dual-process theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“According to this framework, repeated exposure to highly stimulating, fast-paced content may contribute to habituation, in which users become desensitized to slower, more effortful cognitive tasks such as reading, problem solving, or deep learning,” the study reads. “This process may gradually reduce cognitive endurance and weaken the brain’s ability to sustain attention on a single task. Simultaneously, SFV platforms may promote sensitization by providing immediate, algorithmically curated rewards, potentially reinforcing impulsive engagement patterns and encouraging habitual seeking of instant gratification.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt; &lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bingeing TikTok reels may be hazardous to your well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;71 studies, &amp;gt;98k people: The more short-form videos teens and adults watched, the more they struggled with attention, self-control, and stress and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read a book. Watch a movie. Long live longform. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yzyv68kBDh" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yzyv68kBDh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1989360583796572636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;November 14, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;p&gt;This type of content — specifically how it is delivered — stimulates the brain’s reward system, reinforcing habitual use. The study suggests that “excessive” SFV consumption can lead to social isolation, lower life satisfaction, and even self-esteem and body image (the researchers do admit that more research is required on that last note). Increased use of these platforms is also tied to poorer sleep, increased anxiety, and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are all side effects that are also associated with physically addictive substances, which highlights the study’s findings that SFV content is addictive and damaging. On that note, the study created a scale to measure addiction to SFV content that can be used in future studies on this topic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Overall, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the broader health implications of SFV use, given its pervasive role in daily life and potential to impact health, behavior, and well-being. By synthesizing current evidence, this study provides a critical foundation for future research to explore understudied health domains (e.g., cognitive health, physical health) and offers insights to guide public discourse and the development of research-informed approaches for promoting more balanced engagement with SFVs,” the researchers say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In summary, SFV content is reducing attention spans and the ability for users to critically think, quite literally contributing to “brain rot,” &lt;a href="https://modernity.news/2025/11/17/tiktok-zombie-brain-rot-confirmed-by-major-study/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Modernity News&lt;/em&gt; puts it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full study can be &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;downloaded from apa.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-protein-breakfasts-you-can-make-when-youre-still-half-asleep"&gt;quick to to cook&lt;/a&gt; and easy to eat. And each one packs about 6 grams of protein. But there are a lot of other high-protein snacks out there—both in the meat and veggie categories— that offer significantly more protein while being just as easy to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t just talking steaks or &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-protein-meals-easy"&gt;lean chicken breasts&lt;/a&gt;, but a variety of plant and animal proteins that you can snack on or add to meals. Best of all, by broadening your protein intake away from eggs and meat alone, you’ll pack in a whole roster of other benefits for your gut, brain, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Icelandic dried fish to clever whole-food pairings, these non-eggy options will help you meet your fitness goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meat and fish options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gullfiskur Harfiskur (Icelandic Dried Fish)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With 80g protein per 100g, this is lean, briny, and pure,” says David Higgins, the author of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Body Plan,&lt;/em&gt; and co-founder of lifestyle performance club &lt;a data-offer-url="https://body-space.co.uk" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://body-space.co.uk"}' href="https://body-space.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bodyspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This traditional Icelandic snack is quite literally just dried white fish—no frills, no &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/carb-cycling-diet" target="_blank"&gt;carbs&lt;/a&gt;, and more protein than almost any food on the planet. “I first discovered it while working in Iceland and it’s now a non-negotiable travel snack,” says Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat it with a smear of hummus or a grain-based cracker for a smart balance of texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biltong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of biltong as jerky’s more sophisticated cousin. It’s air-dried, richly seasoned beef that’s protein-dense and packed with umami. “My go-to? The Biltong Factory. Their classic cut is clean, chewy, and easy to portion out,” says Higgins, who points to biltong’s whopping 50g of protein per 100g. “Add a handful of roasted chickpeas or lentil crackers for a complete amino chain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seitan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not gluten-intolerant, seitan is a real powerhouse with up to 25g of protein per 100g,” says physical trainer and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pennyweston.com/about-me/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pennyweston.com/about-me/"}' href="https://pennyweston.com/about-me/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Weston&lt;/a&gt;. Often used as a meat alternative by &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-new-veganism"&gt;vegans&lt;/a&gt;, seitan is well known for its texture and it’s ability to absorb flavors, making it a decent addition to curries, stews, stir-frys and other dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edamame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These young soybeans pack a serious protein punch,” says Sas Parsad, nutritionist and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ"}' href="https://thegutco.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoovuuNTAaAtVRQyx3A1CdWpeFpN3dX_z_MrnvdQtXi790DCkADQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Gut Co&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="75d9d247-d03b-4086-b8c8-a4f5e13dacf8"&gt;The United States may lose its measles elimination status as soon as January, marking the sustained resurgence of a disease that had been eliminated from the country 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 10, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/canada-has-lost-its-measles-elimination-status-heres-what-that-means" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/canada-has-lost-its-measles-elimination-status-heres-what-that-means"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada lost its measles elimination status&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after the Pan American Health Organization concluded that the country's recent measles outbreaks were connected and represented ongoing transmission lasting more than 12 months. Measles is considered eliminated in a country or region only when there are no outbreaks lasting longer than a year. Thus, to maintain "elimination status," any introductions of the disease from travel must be quashed before 12 consecutive months of spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="75d9d247-d03b-4086-b8c8-a4f5e13dacf8-2"&gt;A large measles outbreak in West Texas began in January 2025 and has since ended — but while it was raging, it may have sparked cases in Arizona and Utah, where ongoing outbreaks are still occurring.

"But it's likely, as they look at the cases that started off in Texas and have continued to spread, that they will think there have been 12 months of cases coming from that area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles elimination is a cherished goal for public health. The disease, marked by a high fever and dramatic red rash, is miserable at baseline, but it can also have fatal complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. According to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who catch measles die in this acute phase of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For survivors, measles can have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-has-long-term-health-consequences-for-kids-vaccines-can-prevent-all-of-them" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-has-long-term-health-consequences-for-kids-vaccines-can-prevent-all-of-them"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-term health consequences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including immune "amnesia" that leaves them prone to other illnesses. And about 7 to 11 survivors out of every 100,000 people infected face a fatal long-term complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a degenerative nervous system disease that arises years after the measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine reduce the chance of catching measles by 97%, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Because measles is one of the world's most transmissible infectious diseases, however, eliminating it requires high levels of vaccination. In a population without immunity, one person with measles can infect between &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757186/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 and 18 others&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To snuff out an outbreak, you must bring that number down to less than 1, meaning about 95% of the population needs to be protected via vaccination or immunity from a prior infection, Hijano told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zLVNvvkdCVngUVVJVysGp" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zLVNvvkdCVngUVVJVysGp slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, 92.5% of kindergartners are up-to-date on their MMR vaccines, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data from 2024-2025 school year. This number is even lower in some areas and communities, such as the largely Mennonite community in West Texas. These clusters of low vaccination coverage not only represent people at risk of catching measles personally but also pose a challenge for public health responders trying to contain outbreaks, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/amy-k-winter/" target="_blank" data-url="https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/amy-k-winter/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amy Winter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a demographer and infectious-disease epidemiology researcher at the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="0ec1f081-67d1-4933-9ca9-4c1ab230ebab"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Vaccines against measles are highly effective at preventing the infection and its knock-on effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: FatCamera/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="571be1a2-0967-48ae-99ce-87e4471aee0e"&gt;"It's just much harder in terms of personnel going out and doing case investigations," Winter told Live Science. Because so many people are susceptible in these communities, public health officials may have a harder time cataloging an infected person's contacts and encouraging them to isolate or to receive a post-exposure vaccine, which can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/420-250-MeaslesHCFPEP.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/420-250-MeaslesHCFPEP.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prevent or reduce the severity of a measles infection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can't stop a transmission chain within 12 months," Winter said, "it really signals the idea that we don't have control of this pathogen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has seen 45 measles outbreaks and 1,723 confirmed cases in 2025, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covering up to Nov. 12. To determine if any of these outbreaks are connected, indicating ongoing transmission, public health officials investigate each case, looking for times and places when infected individuals may have overlapped with others who caught the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also do genetic testing to determine whether the measles strains behind the cases are related or whether the infection came from a separate introduction. Most travel-related cases occur when a susceptible U.S. resident travels abroad to an area where measles is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Winter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2c3ae67f-d736-40c3-bc6e-adca623ccfff"&gt;This week, public health officials said in a call between federal and state agencies that the West Texas outbreaks were linked to the ongoing Utah and Arizona outbreaks, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/cdc-links-measles-outbreaks-in-multiple-states-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/cdc-links-measles-outbreaks-in-multiple-states-for-the-first-time/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If those findings hold, the U.S. will lose its status in January unless the Arizona and Utah outbreaks end without further transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the confirmed U.S. cases so far this year, 92% have been in unvaccinated individuals and another 4% happened in individuals who have had only their first MMR dose. The recommended MMR dosing schedule is to get the first dose at age 1 and the second between age 4 and 6. To get a handle on measles again, Hijano said, the U.S. will have to boost its nationwide vaccination rate back to above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as we don't have that high rate of immunizations," he said, "there will always be cases of measles that come from another country or another area that will find a place to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="87f7b2af-70b1-4cc4-b5c3-188695d9a156"&gt;

Removing state vaccine requirements for school entry — as has happened in Florida — is demonstrative of this, and represents an unacceptable risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ko6yHaQzQLW8KGtP5PFbkm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ko6yHaQzQLW8KGtP5PFbkm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="b61f3303-5f6c-4ffa-80af-6692bec53a0c"&gt;Given these dangers, what can be done to stem the anti-vaccine movement and the dangers it carries with it?

There can be no improvements in public health or vaccination rates as long as he continues his destructive reign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media and legacy media companies need to take &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-vaccine-confidence-matters-national-security" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-vaccine-confidence-matters-national-security" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;meaningful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and effective steps to end the catastrophic spread of misinformation on their platforms. But they have no real motivation for doing so, since sensationalistic, fact-free health claims are major &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/40/2/daaf023/8100645" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/40/2/daaf023/8100645" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drivers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of engagement, and therefore, of profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gregg Gonsalves pointed out in his recent piece in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/public-health-social-movements-trump/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/public-health-social-movements-trump/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Nation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we must fight these efforts by building a massive movement to support and defend public health. It is time for concerned individuals to pitch in by monitoring state-level attempts to undermine vaccines and taking action to stop them. Finally, the people of the United States need to elect representatives who are better stewards of the health of our people, our communities, our nation, and ultimately, the entire world. The recent elections in November 2025 suggest that Americans are already enacting change at the ballot box. Public pressure can help push public health to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="1d1c2cc1-f777-4f8e-a87c-e1e08dc4bbfb"&gt;&lt;p id="bc9771a8-5dee-44f0-8207-24b748baa08d"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/opinion" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/opinion"&gt;Opinion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on Live Science gives you insight on the most important issues in science that affect you and the world around you today, written by experts and leading scientists in their field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That figure is part of the roughly 38 million Americans who currently have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people learning they have diabetes, the idea of lifestyle change can feel scary or overwhelming. But one Billings man has learned that type 2 diabetes doesn't have to be a life sentence. Instead, he says, it's a condition that requires lifestyle changes and commitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See transformation photos and videos of Nate Porter from the past year:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Required change: Billings man transforms life after type 2 diabetes diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, Nathan "Nate" Porter, 37, began many lifestyle changes after learning he had type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a lot, that's for sure... It's very easy and very normal to get emotional about everything, especially something like this, that in my opinion at that time, was very life changing," he told MTN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter discovered the diagnosis after a regular check-up with his Intermountain Health primary care provider. He said that before finding out he had diabetes, he experienced extreme thirst and frequent urination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have a 44 oz Stanley cup, and I was burning through nine of those a day," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Porter learned of his diagnosis, he immediately began taking control of his health, incorporating exercise and dietary changes into his daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That day, immediately quit smoking cigarettes. (I was an) avid smoker for 15 years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter's primary care provider prescribed medication for his diabetes and referred him to Chelsi Hayter, a family nurse practitioner at the Yellowstone Medical Center's diabetes and endocrinology clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A year later, I would not have thought we would be as far as we are," said Hayter. "I think Nate, right when I walked in the room, Nate was ready. Nate was ready and he had already made some changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an analytical person, Porter said he's been able to navigate this journey, in part, thanks to a continuous glucose monitor. Porter said he needs to be able to see physical data to move forward with his decision-making. The monitor stays in his arm and is constantly tracking his glucose levels. Through an app on his phone, he's aware of his health at all times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I swear by it. It's hands-down amazing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nine years as a healthcare provider, Hayter said technology, such as continuous glucose monitors, helps patients take back control of their diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hayter said for some patients, managing diabetes can be difficult at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those dietary and lifestyle changes are sometimes challenging to make, depending on the patient," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Porter is still navigating the difficulties of diabetes, he looks back on the past year with gratitude as he now has greater agency over his health and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Change, as difficult as it is, it's required," said Porter. "Even though lifestyle changes are very difficult because they are established through those habits, you have to change them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Diabetes, Endocrinology and Weight Management Clinic at the Yellowstone Medical Center, where Porter and Hayter work together, is currently undergoing a major renovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic is expanding and will eventually house 12 new exam rooms. The expansion also includes a conference room for diabetes education and weight-management courses, and will allow for four additional healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic's manager, Katie Watson, told MTN that this expansion is an opportunity for Intermountain Health to better serve community patients who are navigating a diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

Even though the clinic is under renovation, patients with diabetes can still schedule appointments at the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was reported on-air by a journalist, and portions of this article have been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WACO, Texas — The Texas Department of Agriculture is warning of an equine virus outbreak linked to an event in Central Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department issued an alert to horsemen regarding an outbreak of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 (EHV-1) reported by veterinarians after the recent World Championship Barrel Racing (WPRA) Finals in the Waco area Nov. 5-9, according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are asking horse owners, trainers, or venue operators who attended or were in proximity to the event to monitor their animals carefully. Horse owners or facility operators who recently participated in large multi-barn gatherings, roping jackpots, or traveled extensively, including in the Waco region are also urged to monitor and take precautions, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This virus can spread fast, it can be deadly, and the earliest signs are often so subtle they’re easy to miss,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. “That’s why monitoring your horses right now is critical. The quicker we identify a potential case, the better chance we have to protect not only our animals, but the entire Texas equine community.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say "a particularly aggressive" strain of EHV-1 was confirmed by veterinary clinics in Central Texas, and an investigation is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horses can transmit EHV-1 through nose-to-nose contact or aerosolized particles released when an infected animal coughs or sneezes, officials say. It can also spread indirectly through shared tack, grooming tools, water and feed buckets, thermometers or other equipment. Humans can also unintentionally act as carriers by spreading the virus via their hands, clothing or boots, according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

This solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction solution was evaporated to remove TFA, vacuum-dried and then dissolved in deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 with sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and then dialysed against deionized water. OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained after lyophilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Synthesis of OP-DBCO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (30 mg) was dissolved in 3 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), and DBCO-NHS (3 mg) in 2 ml of DMF was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and then dialysed sequentially against a water-DMF mixture (3:2 (v/v)) and water. The product, OP-DBCO, was obtained by lyophilization.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h, and the azide-modified insulin (insulin-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was purified using preparative HPLC (prep-HPLC). For OP–I synthesis, insulin-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2 mg, 0.29 μmol) and OP-DBCO (3.9 mg, 0.88 μmol) were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) and stirred at room temperature for 4 h.

PEG–I was synthesized similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Labelling OP, OP–I, PEG–I and insulin with FITC, Cy3 or Cy5&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FITC, Sulfo-Cy3-NHS or Sulfo-Cy5-NHS solutions in DMSO (5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) were added dropwise with gentle stirring to OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PEG-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, insulin or their conjugates (OP–I or PEG–I) dissolved in PBS (10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, pH 7.4) at a dye-to-insulin molar ratio of 1:1. The reaction was carried out overnight at room temperature in the dark. The labelled polymers, insulin and conjugates were purified using Sephadex G-25 resin to remove the unreacted dye and then lyophilized. The products were stored in the dark at 4 °C for further use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;RP-HPLC analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RP-HPLC analysis was performed using a 1260 binary HPLC pump equipped with a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) and a 1260 infinity II variable wavelength detector set at 280 nm. The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.1% TFA (phase A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA (phase B). The flow rate was set at 1 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The elution gradient was set as follows: 30% to 40% B, 0–5 min; constant 40% B, 5–10 min; 40% to 100% B, 10–11 min; constant 100% B, 11–16 min; 100% to 30% B, 16–17 min; constant 30% B, 17–22 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Stability of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;
                     &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; (0.4 mg) was incubated in 200 μl of DMEM culture medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C. The solution was sampled at 0 h, 6 h and 12 h for RP-HPLC detection (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3 per timepoint), as described above, except that an Agilent 1260 Infinity II fluorescence detector (640 nm excitation, 660 nm emission) was used. The mobile phase remained the same, but the elution gradient was as follows: 0%–100% B, 0–15 min; isocratic at 100% B, 15–20 min; 100%–0% B, 20–21 min; and isocratic at 0% B, 21–26 min. OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; had a retention time of 8.8 min. The target peak integral area was quantified, confirming its structural stability even after 12 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Prep-HPLC for purification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prep-HPLC was performed using the Waters Prep 150 LC system equipped with a Pursuit 5 C18 column (250 × 21.2 mm) and a Waters 2489 UV/VIS detector set at 214 nm and 280 nm. The mobile phases included water with 0.1% TFA (phase A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA (phase B). The elution gradient and flow rates were set as follows: 20% to 40% B with flow rates increasing from 10 to 15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0–10 min; constant 40% B with a constant flow rate of 15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 10–20 min. The retention times were 11.8 min for insulin-N&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; 10.1 min for OP–I and 12.8 min for PEG–I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Gel-permeation chromatography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shimadzu Prominence Plus LC-20AD LC system was equipped with two columns connected in series (PL aquagel-OH MIXED-H and PL aquagel-OH 30), a refractive index detector and a UV/VIS detector. The mobile phase was prepared by mixing acetic acid (100 ml), acetonitrile (150 ml) and deionized water (200 ml). The pH was then adjusted to 2.3 using a concentrated ammonia solution, and the final volume was brought to 500 ml with deionized water. The flow rate was 0.5 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the column temperature was 40 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Circular dichroism spectroscopy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 37 °C on the JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter. Quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1 mm were used. Each spectrum was an average of four scans recorded from 260 to 200 nm at 1 nm steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;MALDI-TOF MS analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All MALDI-TOF MS analyses were performed on a Bruker Autoflex maX TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker), equipped with a modified Nd:YAG laser in positive-ion mode; data acquisition was conducted using the Bruker flexControl 3.4 software. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix.

A Nano ZS Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments) was used to measure the zeta potentials using a 4 mW 633 nm He-Ne laser at 25 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Synthesis of OP–AuNPs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (60 mg) was dissolved in 6 ml of PBS (pH 8.0), and 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut’s reagent, 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and dialysed against water (MWCO 1 kDa) to remove the unreacted components. The product was lyophilized to obtain OP-SH. OP-SH (1 mg) was added to a solution of AuNPs (50 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stirred at 4 °C for 12 h.

After timed topical administration, the mice were euthanized. The treated skin sites were washed and dissected. The entire skin samples were carefully washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and sectioned into 10-μm-thick slices using a cryostat (UV800, Leica Microsystems). 4′,6-Diamidino-2′-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain and label the nuclei of skin tissues, and BODIPY was used to stain and localize subcutaneous fat deposits. Fluorescence images were taken using CLSM with excitation at 405 nm for DAPI, 488 nm for BODIPY or FITC, and 640 nm for OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;. The CLSM images were analysed using ImageJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; solution (0.2 ml, Cy5-equivalent dose, 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was applied to the mice as described above. Blood samples (200 μl) were collected from the orbit venous plexus at timed intervals, and their Cy5 fluorescence intensities were measured using a microplate spectrophotometer with excitation at 640 nm. The main organs of the mice, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidneys, were also collected at timed topical administration of OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;, and their fluorescence intensities were measured using the IVIS Spectrum imaging system (IVIS Lumina XRMS Series III, PerkinElmer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; was dispersed in a cream (water-in-oil, Aquaphor; Cy5-equivalent dose, 10 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The OP&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; cream was topically applied on the minipig abdominal skin (cream volume, 10 ml; application area, 100 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 4 h. The minipigs were euthanized, and the treated skin sites were dissected and sectioned into slices, as mentioned above. Fluorescence images were taken using CLSM with excitation at 405 nm for DAPI and 640 nm for OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;.

The solution (0.1 ml; Cy5-equivalent dose, 0.1 mg per kg) of insulin&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; or OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; was injected through the tail vein. Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at timed intervals. The fluorescence intensity was quantified using the IVIS Spectrum system. The insulin concentration was also measured using human insulin ELISA kits (Elabscience). The half-lives of insulin and OP–I were calculated using DAS2 software based on the plasma concentration data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;HAADFI–STEM-EDS analysis of OP–AuNP-treated skin cryosections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;C57BL/6J male mice were topically administered with 0.2 ml OP–AuNPs (OP-equivalent dose, 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). After 4 h, the mice were anaesthetized. The skin at the treated site was dissected and fixed overnight at 4 °C. The samples were trimmed into small sections and then treated with 1% osmium tetroxide (diluted in 100 mM cacodylate buffer) for 2 h, dehydrated with ethanol and acetone, and embedded in Spurr resin. Then, 10-μm-thick slices were sectioned (LKB 11800 Pyramitome) and stained with toluidine blue to select the desired regions. The ultrathin sections (50–100 nm) were prepared using an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAADFI STEM-EDS analysis of the skin cryosections was performed on a field emission transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM F200) at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV equipped with an EDS detector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Cellular uptake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AML-12 cells, 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes and MSMC cells were seeded into confocal dishes at a density of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml and incubated for 24 h. The cells were treated with OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; (Cy5-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 4 h. After incubation, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μM) for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and imaged using CLSM at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm for Hoechst 33342 and 640 nm for Cy5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;SPR analysis of binding affinity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore X100 instrument (Cytiva) with data acquisition using Biacore X100 system control software (v.2.0.1.201). The CM5 chip sensor (GE Healthcare) was used in this study. Anti-His antibodies were immobilized on the surface of the CM5 chip sensor according to the manufacturer’s instructions. His-tag-ECD-IR/IGF1R protein (Sino Biological) was then injected over the anti-His antibody-coated surface of the CM5 chip sensor at a specific concentration and flow rate. The binding affinities of insulin and OP–I were evaluated by injecting various concentrations of insulin (9.75, 19.5, 39.0, 78.0 and 156 nM) or OP–I (4.06, 8.13, 16.3, 32.5 and 65.0 nM) in HEPES running buffer (pH 7.4) over the His-tag-ECD-IR/IGF1R-coated surface under a single-cycle kinetics mode. Each cycle included a 180 s binding phase and a 300 s dissociation phase. The dissociation equilibrium constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;), association rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;) and dissociation rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;) were determined using the BIA evaluation software (v.2.0.1.201). The &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; values, which define the residence time, were determined using the formula ln2/&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Western blotting for insulin signalling analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were injected subcutaneously with PBS or insulin (insulin-equivalent dose, 5 U kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), or topical administration with OP–I (insulin-equivalent dose, 116 U kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; concentration, 0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; volume, 0.2 ml; diffusing area, 1.13 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The mice were euthanized, and their skeletal muscle tissues were collected at 1 h after subcutaneous injection or 4 h after topical administration. Muscle samples were weighed and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C and quantified using the BCA protein assay. The proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer with 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% BSA for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies against phosphorylated IRβ/IGF1Rβ (1:1,000), phosphorylated AKT-Thr308 (1:1,000) or GAPDH (1:5,000). After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (HRP-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) or HRP-labelled Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)) at a dilution of 1:1,000 at room temperature for 1 h. Signal detection was performed using Immobilon Forte chemiluminescence substrate on the ChemiScope 3600 Mini Imaging System (Clinx Science Instruments). The membranes were next incubated in stripping buffer (BL526, Biosharp) at room temperature with gentle agitation for 15 min, followed by extensive washing with TBST, and then overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies against IRβ and AKT. The membranes were processed as previously described, including incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and signal detection through chemiluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;OP–I permeation in 3D skin equivalent EpiKutis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D skin model (EpiKutis) was fabricated according to a previously reported method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Chen, L. et al.

Before production runs, the lipid system was equilibrated for 100 ns; then, 200-ns runs were conducted to monitor insulin, OP or OP–I adsorption on the SC lipids. After adsorptions, three independent 100-ns runs were further performed for insulin, OP or OP–I to monitor their diffusions on SC lipids. To analyse the binding interactions of insulin or OP–I with IR, 200-ns MD simulations were conducted for each system.

The PMF setups were similar to the aforementioned MD setups to estimate the energy barriers for the diffusion of insulin, OP or OP–I on the SC lipids. The total transverse distance along each representative path was 2 nm, which was divided into 20 windows with a resolution of 0.1 nm. Position restraints were applied to the SC lipids when the energy barriers were scanned. For monitoring the adsorption of insulin, OP, or OP–I on SC lipids, the simulation boxes were extended to 11.4 × 11.4 × 22.1 nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by adding 0.15 mM NaCl solution in the boxes. After a further 30-ns equilibration, the sampling path of each system was obtained by pulling insulin, OP or OP–I in the perpendicular (&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;) direction to the SC lipid membrane with a constant velocity of 0.2 nm ns&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The total sampling distance in the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; direction was 9 nm for each system, which was divided into 90 windows with a resolution of 0.1 nm. At each window, the system was first equilibrated for 5 ns, followed by a 35-ns productive umbrella sampling with a restraint force constant of 1,000 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. To evaluate the binding affinity of insulin or OP–I with IR, the sampling path of each system was determined by pulling insulin or OP–I perpendicular to the IR surface at a constant velocity of 0.2 nm ns&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The total sampling distance of 5 nm was divided into 50 windows with a resolution of 0.1 nm. At each window, the system underwent a 2-ns equilibration phase followed by a 20-ns productive umbrella sampling simulation, applying a restraint force constant of 1,000 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;VE penetration study using 3D-cultured multilayer HaCat spheroids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multilayer cell spheroids were prepared using the hanging-drop method. HaCat cells were suspended in fresh DMEM medium (containing 0.12% (w/v) methylcellulose) at a density of 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml. The cell suspensions (25 μl) were dropped onto the lids of the cell culture plate to form uniform droplets, and 20 ml PBS was added to the plate to keep the droplets moist. The cells were incubated for 72 h and formed dense spheroids, which were transferred to an agarose-coated (1% (w/v) in PBS) 96-well plate with one spheroid per well and incubated for another 72 h to mature. The spheroids were incubated with OP–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt;, PEG–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt; or insulin&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt; at an FITC-equivalent dose of 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for timed intervals. The spheroids were washed with PBS and imaged using CLSM by &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack tomoscan at 20 μm intervals from the bottom to the middle of the spheroids. The integration of FITC fluorescence density and linescan analysis were performed using Image J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the effects of the endocytosis and exocytosis inhibitors on the penetration of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt;, the HaCat spheroids were separately treated with PBS, wortmannin (2 μM), cytochalasin D (20 μM), monensin (20 μM), nocodazole (10 μM) or brefeldin A (10 μM) for 2 h, and then incubated with OP–I&lt;sup&gt;FITC&lt;/sup&gt; (FITC-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 4 h. The HaCat spheroids were imaged and analysed as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Localization of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; at HaCat cell membranes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HaCat cells were plated onto glass-bottom dishes at a density of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per dish and incubated for 24 h.

The cell membrane was stained with NBD-C6-HPC (1 μM) for 5 min, and then the cells were washed three times with PBS and observed under CLSM.

The cells were then incubated with OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; (Cy5-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 12 h and then extensively rinsed with sterilized PBS and isolated. The OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;-treated HaCat cells were mixed with untreated HaCat&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells at the same cell density. The mixed cells were co-cultured in DMEM medium for 12 h and imaged with CLSM with excitation at 488 nm for GFP and 640 nm for Cy5. The mixed cells co-cultured in DMEM medium for 3 h, 6 h or 12 h were further isolated and analysed by flow cytometry. First, an FSC-A versus SSC-A gate was applied to exclude debris and select live cells based on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) characteristics. Next, a GFP gate (FL1-H) was set to include cells with fluorescence in the GFP channel, followed by establishing a Cy5 gate (FL4-H) to isolate Cy5-positive cells. Finally, an intersection gate between the GFP and Cy5 gates was used to identify dual-positive cells. Every 10,000 cells were counted to determine GFP-positive cells at the FL1 channel and Cy5-positive cells at the FL4 channel. The experiment was repeated three times independently; FlowJo (v.10.0) software was used for analysis. The transfer efficiency of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt; to HaCat&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells was calculated according to the formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{Transfer}\,\mathrm{efficiency}( \% )=\frac{{\mathrm{Number\; of\; HaCat}}^{\mathrm{GFP}+\mathrm{Cy}5}\,\mathrm{cells}}{\mathrm{Total\; counted\; number\; of}\,{\mathrm{HaCat}}^{\mathrm{GFP}}\,\mathrm{cells}}\times 100$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Non-contact inhibition of intercellular transfer of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;

The cells on the coverslips were washed with PBS, and the cell membrane was stained with NBD-C6-HPC (1 μM) for 5 min. The cells were imaged with CLSM at 488 nm excitation for NBD-C6-HPC and 640 nm for Cy5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Intercellular transfer between cells on separate coverslips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two coverslips were seeded with HaCat cells (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; each) and cultured overnight to ensure full adherence.

Coverslip 1 was placed on top of the other coverslip with untreated HaCat cells (coverslip 2) and pressed slightly. The coverslips were cultured together in DMEM medium for 0.5 or 1 h and then observed using CLSM for the transfer of OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;TIRFM imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HaCat cells were seeded onto a confocal dish at a density of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, OP–I&lt;sup&gt;Cy3&lt;/sup&gt; (Cy3-equivalent dose, 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was added. After 4 h, NBD-C6-HPC was added to stain the cell membrane for 5 min, and the cells were then washed three times with PBS.

The resulting colonies were further expanded and genotyped by high-throughput sequencing of the targeted locus and those found to be homozygous for the expected edit were retained for downstream experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Lentiviral production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEK293Ts (ATCC CRL-3216) were transfected with pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) and delta8.2 (Addgene Plasmid #8455) packaging plasmids alongside the appropriate lentiviral backbone using Lipofectamine 2000. Lentiviral backbone sequences used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μM filter 48 h after transfection.

Oligonucleotide pools were amplified using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB M0494L) to create double-stranded inserts for isothermal assembly. Primers used are indicated in each specific screening section of the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#Sec16"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;. The minimum number of PCR cycles was used to amplify (typically between 11 and 13 cycles) and double-stranded inserts were checked for size and/or inappropriate products by TapeStation (Agilent). For each 20-μl reaction cloned into the pSEP0308, pSEP0309 or pSEP0310 lentiviral backbones with a 300-bp insert, 50 ng of the appropriate lentiviral backbone was assembled with 10 ng of the appropriate double-stranded insert using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB E2621L). Reactions were scaled according to the number of elements in the library. For each 1,000 elements, an additional 20-μl reaction was set up. Reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h and then pooled and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reaction products were eluted in a minimum of 20 μl ddH2O, but otherwise were eluted in 2.5 μl per original 20-μl reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isothermal assembly reactions were electroporated into NEB 10-beta Electrocompetent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (NEB C3020) and plated onto LB plates aiming for at least 1,000× coverage of each library element. 14 h later, colonies were scraped and prepared using Qiagen Plasmid Plus kits (Qiagen 12945 and 12963) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled plasmids were transfected into HEK293Ts alongside lentiviral packaging plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μM filter 48 h after transfection. Cells were transduced with virus aiming for a multiplicity of infection of 0.3. Cells were transduced to ensure ≥1,000× coverage of transduced cells per element of the library. 2 d after transduction, cells were passaged with 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; puromycin for 3–4 days to enrich for transduced cells. For screens requiring FACS isolation of GFP-positive cells, we calculated approximate coverage by multiplying the per cent of GFP-positive cells by the number of elements in the library and aiming for 1,000× coverage of that number. For example, if 10% of cells were GFP-positive for a 500 element library, we sorted at least 50,000 cells per replicate. Cells were pelleted and flash frozen on dry ice. Genomic DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Micro kits (Qiagen 56304) or QIAamp Mini kits (Qiagen 51304) depending on the cell number isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All genomic DNA for each replicate was input into an initial set of PCR reactions using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB M0494L) to amplify the integrated lentiviral cassette and to add sequencing adapters, with a maximum of 5 μg genomic DNA per 50-μl reaction. Primers used are indicated in each screening section and are also listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. PCR reactions were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen 28104) according to manufacturer’s instructions and 2 μl of PCR product was input into a second PCR reaction to add unique sample indices and flow cell adapters to each amplicon. Final PCR reactions were bead purified with a ratio of 0.7× using SPRI beads, quality controlled using a TapeStation (Agilent) and quantified using a Qubit prior to high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq, Illumina NextSeq, or Element Biosciences AVITI instrument. Sequencing conditions and downstream analyses are specific to each screen and are indicated in each separate screening section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;PE2 screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To convert each endogenous tRNA into a sup-tRNA, we identified 418 high-confidence tRNA genes and identified the two closest 20-bp spacers with an NGG protospacer-adjacent motif upstream and downstream of the anticodon. We allowed prime editing to target multiple tRNAs in the case of identical mature tRNA sequences. We systematically varied the PBS lengths from 11 bp to 14 bp, and varied the RTT homology lengths 3′ of the last edited nucleotide from 6 bp to 10 bp, where feasible. We designed three prime editing screens, each with RTTs that replaced the anticodon of each endogenous tRNA with one of three sup-tRNA anticodons (CUA, UCA or UUA). To enhance prime editing efficiency, we appended a structured RNA motif, tevopreQ1, to the 3′ end of each pegRNA, creating epegRNAs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Nelson, J. W. et al. Engineered pegRNAs improve prime editing efficiency. Nat.

In total, we designed 17,579 epegRNAs to convert endogenous tRNAs to sup-tRNAs for each of the three possible sup-tRNA anticodons. Each pool also included 420 control epegRNAs targeting serine and arginine tRNAs, swapping their anticodons for those of other serine and arginine anticodons, which are not expected to give signal in a readthrough-based screen (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). We included a unique barcode sequence 3′ of the polyT terminator sequence for each epegRNA to improve our ability to assign each sequencing read to the correct element. The final oligonucleotides had the following design: a common 5′ end for isothermal assembly (5′-tatcttgtggaaaggacgaaacacc-3′), a unique epegRNA sequence followed by a polyT for Pol III termination, an adjustable length linker used to ensure that each element of the library was the same length, a unique 25 bp barcode, and a common 3′ end for isothermal assembly (5′-ctcgagtactaggatccattaggcg-3′). Oligonucleotides were amplified using oSEP0114 and oSEP0115 prior to isothermal assembly into a linearized pSEP0308 with a hU6 promoter for driving expression of the epegRNAs. Final libraries for next generation sequencing were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using oSEP0213 as a custom Read1 primer with 300 cycles. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Lentiviral sup-tRNA screen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate a wide range of tRNA promoter variants in high-throughput, we took the 418 high-confidence tRNA sequences from the human genome and swapped their anticodon to CUA, UCA or UUA to target the stop codons TAG, TGA or TAA, respectively. A unique barcode was assigned to each tRNA variant to reduce the likelihood that sequencing errors would influence assignment of library members. In addition, a pre-integrated Nextera Read1 adapter was included so that Read1 sequences on an Illumina instrument will read straight into the highly complex barcode for defining clusters. We cloned this pool using isothermal assembly into three different lentiviral backbones to evaluate the effect of different upstream elements on sup-tRNA efficacy: pSEP0308, which has a hU6 promoter, pSEP0309, which has a minU6 promoter and pSEP0310, which contains no exogenous promoter. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM5"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Leader and terminator sequence screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the initial leader sequence screen, the 40 bp upstream of each endogenous high-confidence tRNA in the human genome was determined and placed upstream of the mature sequence for tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 with its anticodon changed to CUA followed by a polyT termination sequence. As controls, the same leader sequences were placed upstream of the mature sequence for tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1 with its native anticodon. Libraries were sequenced and exact matching was used for both the leader sequence and the anticodon region of the read to assign to the correct library element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM6"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To next screen leader sequences across a wide range of sup-tRNAs, we generated a lentiviral library containing six leader sequences (two top-performing, two bottom-performing and two random sequences) paired with 418 human tRNAs with their anticodons switched to CUA, UCA or UAA. We also assessed the effect of each terminator sequence when placed downstream of sup-tRNAs paired with their endogenous leader sequences, with a total of 11,543 combinations of leader sequence, sup-tRNA and terminator. We included a unique 20-bp barcode sequence 3′ of the terminator sequence for each tRNA to improve our ability to assign each sequencing read to the correct element. For analysis, the first 25 cycles of the read were matched exactly to the barcode for each element of the screening pool, allowing for no mismatches. For analysis, alignment was confirmed between tRNA elements and the 20-bp barcode region and then subsequently the 20-bp barcode was used to assign each read to the appropriate library element. Reads were normalized on the basis of sequencing depth and sorted samples were compared with the plasmid pool representation of each element. Oligonucleotides and results for this screen are recorded in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM7"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Saturation mutagenesis screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To design variants for saturation mutagenesis screening, every sequence containing a SNV, paired substitution at all hairpin positions, and 1-bp deletion was generated computationally. Then, 25 bp ends compatible with isothermal assembly were added to either side (see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) and a unique barcode was assigned to each tRNA variant to reduce the likelihood that sequencing errors would influence assignment of library members. In addition, a pre-integrated Nextera Read1 adapter was included so that Read1 sequences on an Illumina instrument will read straight into the highly complex barcode for defining clusters. Variants were ordered as a Twist oligonucleotide pool for each individual tRNA for tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1, tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1 and tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 (sequences in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM8"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). A pooled library of all possible variants for tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, tRNA-Leu-TAA-3-1, and tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 was ordered as a separate Leu-TAA focused library (sequences in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM9"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the tRNA-Arg-CCT-4-1, mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1, and tRNA-Tyr-GTA-2-1 screens, Twist oligonucleotides contained a leader sequence element for each tRNA and they were cloned by isothermal assembly into the pSEP0310 lentiviral backbone with no exogenous Pol III promoter. For the tRNA-Leu-TAA-4-1 and Leu-TAA focused library, Twist oligonucleotides did not contain a leader sequence element for each tRNA and they were cloned by isothermal assembly into the pSEP0308 lentiviral backbone with an exogenous hU6 promoter driving expression of the tRNAs. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina instrument with 26 cycles for Read1 covering the barcode region and 86 cycles for Read2 covering the tRNA region. For analysis, alignment was confirmed between tRNA elements and the 25-bp barcode region and then subsequently the 25-bp barcode was used to assign each read to the appropriate library element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;epegRNA optimization with synthetic target-site screening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To optimize epegRNA architectures, we designed a lentiviral epegRNA library of 17,280 epegRNAs to test out five spacer variants, PBS lengths from 8 to 16 nt, RTT lengths from 21 to 36 nt, and combinations of each of the 19 mutation variants of interest alongside 720 control epegRNAs with RTTs that do not encode an anticodon edit. On the same oligonucleotide, we encoded an adjacent tRNA-Leu-TAA-1-1 synthetic target site directly adjacent to the lentiviral epegRNA to read out both the epegRNA and the outcome of editing in the same sequencing read.

Each TAG stop codon was flanked on either side by the 18 nucleotides present in the native mRNA sequence. Positive controls were generated that contained the same sequence context but a TTG Leucine codon instead of a TAG premature stop codon. For negative controls, 2,800 ‘redundant stop’ control library members were generated, which were a subset of the ClinVar variants and their TTG controls but with the codon following the TAG stop codon or TTG codon changed to a TAA stop codon followed by a +1 frameshift to prevent readthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pSEP0211 lentiviral backbone was first linearized using oSEP0163 and oSEP0164 and the oligonucleotide pool was amplified using oSEP0165 and oSEP0166 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). These sequences were cloned into the pSEP0211 lentiviral backbone between mCherry and GFP via Gibson assembly. Two days following transduction, we extracted both mRNA and genomic DNA from the transduced cell population, generated cDNA by reverse transcription, and sequenced the integrated reporter construct from both the cDNA and genomic DNA samples. For analysis, we calculated an ‘RNA score’ metric by quantifying the frequency of each element in the cDNA and dividing that value by the frequency of that element in the genomic DNA. To control for the impact each unique sequence context might have on transcript expression level independent of readthrough activity, we defined a ‘readthrough score’ for each ClinVar PTC by dividing the RNA score of each variant by the RNA score of its corresponding no-premature-stop equivalent.

In brief, the sequence encoded by the RTT was compared base-by-base to the nucleotide sequence 3′ of the cas9 nick site of each potential off-target site with an ‘off-target marker’ sequence being identified as the minimal deviating sequence between the two. The presence of this off-target marker sequence was quantified using output from CRISPResso2 and was used as a proxy for off-target prime editing.

A pooled sequencing primer was generated for nominated human off-target sites using the rhAmpSeq design tool (IDT). Genomic DNA was extracted from editor-treated HEK293T cells and amplified with rhAmpSeq pooled sequencing primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The amplified libraries were sequenced with 300-bp single-end reads with an Illumina MiSeq. Sequences for rhAmpSeq amplicons were extracted using the R Bioconductor BSGenome package (v.1.4.3) using the GRCh37/hg19 (human) reference genomes. CRISPResso2 was used to align the rhAmpSeq reads to the amplicon reference sequences and quantify the number of reads with each possible edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in media containing 10% FBS, and the solution was filtered through a 45-μm cell strainer prior to flow cytometry or FACS isolation.

A total of 200 ng, 66 ng and 22 ng of prime editor plasmid, epegRNA plasmid and ngRNA plasmid (where indicated), respectively, were transfected per well. 3 d after transfection, cells were lysed and genomic DNA was collected by incubation in a lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% SDS and 800 units per μl of proteinase K (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by enzyme inactivation at 80 °C for 30 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rescue experiments performed in the HEK293T disease models, cells were initially seeded at 200,000 cells per well in 12-well plates (Corning). The following day, cells were transfected with 700 ng of PE6c prime editor plasmid, 200 ng of epegRNA plasmid and 75 ng of ngRNA plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 3 d after transfection, genomic DNA was extracted as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Protein isolation and enzymatic activity assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For assays using human cells, cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and repelleted. For the tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP1) assay, pelleted cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. For the hexosaminidase (HEXA) assay, pelleted cells were lysed in a RIPA homogenizing buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4 °C for 30 min. In both cases, lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For both HEXA and TPP1 assays, the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay was determined by a standard curve derived from measurements of known quantities of wild-type protein lysate (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09732-2#MOESM1"&gt;10b,c&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the TPP1 assay, 10 μg of protein lysate was incubated at 37 °C overnight in a 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 4 containing the Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin substrate (Sigma, A3401) at a final concentration of 250 μM in a reaction volume of 40 μl. Endpoint fluorescence was then measured with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 460 nm (20 nm bandwidth). Enzymatic activity relative to wild-type was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence values from each treatment condition by the mean fluorescence values of mock-treated wild-type HEK293T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the HEXA assay, 5 μg of protein lysate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 containing either 4-methylumbelliferone-f-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine (MUG, Sigma, 69585) or 4-methylumbelliferone-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (MUGS, Sigma, 454428) substrate at a concentration of 3.2 mM. Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl and stopped by the addition of 200 μl of a 100 mM solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. Endpoint fluorescence measurements were made with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth). HEXA activity was normalized to HEXB activity by dividing the mean fluorescence values from the MUGS (HEXA) reaction by the corresponding mean fluorescence values from the MUG (HEXB) reaction. Enzymatic activity relative to wild-type was calculated by dividing the derived mean HEXA activity values for each treatment condition by that of the mean HEXA activity values from mock-treated wild-type HEK293T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For measurements of α-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-iduronidase in mouse tissue, protein was extracted by first homogenizing the tissue using the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) in T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78510) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C and supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 40 μg of whole protein lysate was incubated overnight in a 130 mM sodium formate buffer containing 0.42 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, S0375) and 4MU-iduronic acid (0.12 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-220961) at pH 3.5. Endpoint fluorescence measurements were made with a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission of wavelength of 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Western blotting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in a RIPA homogenizing buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 10 μg of whole protein lysate was separated by SDS–PAGE using a 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus Mini Protein Gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot 2 Dry Blotting system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) then incubated in a 5% milk solution in 1 × Tris-Buffered Saline, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). The blocked membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight in NPC1 (Abcam, ab134113, 1:2,500 dilution) or GAPDH (Santa Cruz, sc-47724, 1:5,000 dilution) primary antibody. The following day, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, ab6721; 1:10,000 dilution) for NPC1 and anti-mouse IgG (Abcam, ab205719; 1:10,000 dilution) for GAPDH for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was removed and the membrane was washed and signal was collected using the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Protein isolation, trypsin digestion and TMT labelling for mass spectrometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein was isolated as described for Western blotting. To prepare samples for mass spectrometry, samples were passed over S-trap micro spin columns (Profiti) according to manufacturer’s protocols with the following modifications: 10 mM DTT (final concentration) was used instead of TCEP. After adding DTT, tubes were placed on a heating block for 10 min at 95 °C. Disulfides were alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (final concentration) instead of methyl methanethiosulfonate, and after adding the iodoacetamide the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark. After digestion with 5 µg trypsin (Thermo Fisher 90057), samples were desalted using Pierce Peptide Desalting Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher 89852) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The desalted tryptic peptides were resuspended in 100 µl of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB), vortexed, and briefly centrifuged. For labelling with tandem mass tags (TMTs), lyophilized TMTpro Label reagents (Thermo Fisher A44520) were used according to manufacturer’s protocols. At the time of labelling, aliquots were equilibrated at room temperature and 20 µl of anhydrous acetonitrile was added to each tube. The TMT reagents were vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and allowed to dissolve for 5 min at 25 °C. TMT reagents were added to each 100-µl sample, vortexed, and briefly centrifuged. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After 1 h, 5 µl of 5% hydroxylamine was added to each sample and incubated for 15 min to quench the reaction. Equal amounts of each labelled sample were then combined together and speed-vacuumed to dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;LC–MS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TMT-labelled tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Thermo Ultimate 3000) using a Thermo PepMap RSLC C18 column (2 µm tip, 75 µm x 50 cm ES903) over a gradient before nano-electrospray using a Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 60,000 across 450–1,600 &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; and maximum IT 50 ms. The full mass spectrometry scan was followed by MS/MS for as many precursor ions in a three-second cycle with a NCE of 32, dynamic exclusion of 30 s and resolution of 45,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Database search with Proteome Discoverer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Sequest HT in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo). Sequest search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.02 Da for fragment ion mass tolerance; 2 missed cleavages of trypsin. Fixed modifications were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMTpro modification on lysines and peptide N termini. Variable modifications were methionine oxidation, methionine loss at the N terminus of the protein, acetylation of the N terminus of the protein, and methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N terminus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;AAV production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAV production was performed using HEK293T clone 17 cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) maintained in DMEM plus GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS without antibiotic in 150 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The day before transfection cells were plated at a density of 18 million cells per 150 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plate. The following day, 5.7 μg of AAV genome plasmid, 11.4 μg of pHelper (Clontech) and 22.8 μg of rep-cap plasmid per plate were delivered via polyethyleneimine transfection (PEI MAX, Polysciences). Three days after transfection, cells were collected by cell scraping and pelleted at 3,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min. Medium was decanted into a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and NaCl at a final concentration of 8% PEG and 500 mM NaC and incubated on ice for 2 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl per plate of a hypertonic buffer containing 40 mM Tris base, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; salt active nuclease (ArcticZymes) and incubated for one hour at 37 °C. The medium-containing solution was then pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 µl per plate of a hypertonic lysis buffer and combined with the cell lysate. This lysate was then added to Beckman Coulter Quick-Seal tubes via 16-gauge, 5-inch needles (Air-Tite N165) in a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol in sequentially floating layers as follows: 9 ml of 15% iodixanol in 500 mM NaCl and 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK (1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2.5 mM KCl), 6 ml of 25% iodixanol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK and 5 ml each of 40% and 60% iodixanol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline-MK with phenol red at a concentration of 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 15%, 25% and 60% layers to aid layer visualization This gradient was then ultracentrifuged using a fixed-angle Ti 70 rotor in an Optima XPN-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 68,000 rpm for one hour at 18 °C. Next, 3 ml of virus-containing solution was extracted from the 40–60% iodixanol interface via an 18-gauge needle. Buffer was exchanged for cold phosphate-buffered saline with 0.001% F-68 using a PES 100 kD MWCO column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and concentrated. The resulting AAV-containing solution was sterile filtered using a 0.22-μm filter and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (AAVpro Titration Kit version 2, Clontech). Purified virus was stored at 4 °C until use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Animal use&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All experiments involving live animals were approved by the Broad Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (D16-00903; 0048-04-15-2). Mouse housing facilities were maintained at 20–22 °C with 30–50% humidity, on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to standard rodent diet and water. For experiments involving &lt;i&gt;Idua&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;W392X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we used Strain from Jackson Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Neonatal ventricular injections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syringes for microinjection were prepared by pulling PCR Micropipettes (Drummond Scientific Company, 5-000-1001-X10) with the Sutter P1000 micropipette puller for a tip diameter size of 100 μm. The injection solution was prepared by mixing 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; vg of each half of prime editor encoding AAV and 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; vg of reporter AAV in 0.9% NaCl solution (Covetrus, 061758) in total volume of 4 μl, along with 0.1 μl of Fast Green. A total of 4 μl of injection solution was front-loaded to the micropipette syringe for injection. Neonatal mice were anaesthetized on ice. A total of 2 μl of injection solution was injected into each ventricle with successful injection being verified by the spread of Fast Green dye by transillumination of the head. Litters were randomized for injection with a given AAV composition. Both sexes were included for each experimental condition for in vivo experiments. Both sexes were assigned to each experimental group as evenly as possible. No statistics were performed to pre-determine sample size for each group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;In vivo prime editing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments demonstrating readthrough of an exogenous reporter co-administered via AAV, we evaluated both TAG and TGA stop codon readthrough. To achieve TGA stop codon readthrough, we used the epegRNA architecture optimized for the introduction of the CUA anticodon but modified the 3′ extension to introduce a UCA anticodon. The reporter construct contained an eGFP expression cassette with either a TAG or TGA PTC at codon 81 or the wild-type glutamine codon. In experiments evaluating the long-term tolerability of PERT, we delivered editing reagents in the v3em dual-AAV architecture introducing either an CUA anticodon into the mouse tRNA-Leu-TAA-2-1 gene, or a control +5 G-to-T edit in the &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; locus. At three weeks, the cortices and livers from mice were processed for whole proteome mass spectrometry to evaluate readthrough past natural stop codons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Mouse tissue collection, histology and immunohistochemistry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice used in this study were sacrificed by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; asphyxiation, and unperfused tissues were immediately dissected. For protein and DNA analysis, dissected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extraction was performed as described above. Genomic DNA and RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For histology and immunohistochemistry, dissected tissues were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then soaked in 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. Following routine processing and paraffin embedding, tissue sections were stained with either haematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, or prepared for immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry, 4-μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval using a sodium citrate buffer. After quenching endogenous peroxidase and application of a protein block (Dako), sections were incubated with either an anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab183734) or an anti-iduronidase (R&amp;amp;D systems, AF4119) antibody. Staining was detected using a species-specific detection kit, diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen, and Mayer’s Haematoxylin (Dako) was used as the counterstain. Primary antibodies were substituted with an appropriate negative-control IgG for negative-control slides. For Alcian blue staining, 4-μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were stained with the Alcian Blue–1%, pH 2.5 kit (Newcomer, 9102A). Tissue histopathology was performed at the University of Minnesota Comparative Pathology Shared Resource and pathology scoring was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the treatment conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;Statistics and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All screens were performed in independent biological duplicates.

A delay epoch started from the onset of the cue presentation. Licking during the delay epoch aborted the trial without a water reward, followed by a 1.5-s timeout epoch. Licking during the 10-s answer epoch following the delay was considered a ‘correct lick’, and a water reward (approximately 2 µl per drop) was delivered immediately, followed by a 1.5-s consumption epoch. If mice did not lick during the 10-s answer period, the trial would end without a reward. Trials were separated by an ITI randomly sampled from an exponential distribution with a mean of 3 s, with 1-s offset (with a maximum ITI of 7 s). This prevented mice from predicting the trial onset without a cue. Animals had to withhold licking during the full ITI epoch for the next trial to begin (otherwise, the ITI epoch repeated). In approximately 10% of randomly interleaved trials, the auditory cue was omitted to assess spontaneous lick rate (‘no-cue’ trials). No water reward was delivered in no-cue trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We followed the protocol described in Majumder et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Majumder, S. et al.

Once mice reached 1.8-s delay, we started either the switching delay, the random delay or the constant delay conditions (see Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for example sessions). In the switching delay condition, we switched the delay between 1 s versus 3 s or 1 versus 1.8 s every 30–70 trials (the number of trials was randomly selected from 30 to 70 and not contingent upon behaviour). Similarly, in the random delay condition, we randomly switched the delay among 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 or 5.0 s every 30–70 trials. For the constant delay condition, mice were trained with a constant delay of 1.5 s across sessions for at least 2 weeks. For the cue-intensity experiments (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we changed the cue intensity (3-kHz auditory cue, ±15 dB, lasting 0.6 s) in randomly interleaved test trials (approximately 20%). Except for this modification, the task structure was identical. Cue intensity stayed constant (74 dB) before the cue-intensity experiments. Otherwise, the task design and reward contingency remained the same. ALM and striatal perturbation experiments (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;) were performed under the switching delay condition.

For the H-2 probes, voltage signals were multiplexed, recorded on a PCI6133 board (National Instruments) and digitized at 400 kHz (14-bit). All recordings were made with the open-source software SpikeGLX (&lt;a href="http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/"&gt;http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/&lt;/a&gt;). During recordings, the craniotomy was immersed in a cortex buffer (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; adjusted pH to 7.4).

Lick time was measured by detecting the contact of the tongue with the lick port using an electrical lick detector. For optogenetic experiments, we analysed trials with the first lick occurring after the onset time of photostimulation (0.6 s after the cue) in both control and photostimulated trials to compare the effect of photostimulation on behaviour. The no-lick rate was calculated as the probability of mice not responding within 5 s after the cue. The shift in lick time (Δlick time) was based on the median lick time. The post-stimulation lick rate (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig12"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) was calculated as the probability of mice licking within 0.6 s after the photostimulation offset time in no-cue trials. To analyse behaviour while the mice were engaged in the task, we analysed all trials between the first occurrence of five consecutive cue trials with licks and 20 trials before the last occurrence of three consecutive no-lick trials without photostimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to the attenuation of behavioral effects of optogenetic manipulation (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig12"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), we restricted analyses of both behavioural and physiological data to the first (for striatal manipulation) or the first two (for ALM manipulation) manipulation sessions per mouse. All analyses, including the calculation of confidence intervals and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values, were performed using a hierarchical bootstrap, unless stated otherwise. First, we randomly selected animals with replacements. Second, we randomly selected sessions for each animal with replacement. Third, we randomly selected trials for each session with replacements. Then, we calculated the behavioural metrics described above. This procedure was repeated 1,000 times to estimate the mean, confidence intervals and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar1"&gt;Timer model and hazard rate analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To interpret the effects of optogenetic manipulations, we numerically simulated how different operations influence a timer, an accumulator that infers passage of time by integrating a constant input or periodic event, such as a water clock, hourglass, pendulum clock and quartz watch (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). We modelled time as a scalar variable representing the temporal integration of a constant inflow signal. Specifically, the internal representation of time &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) evolves according to the equation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$T(t)=\underset{0}{\overset{t}{\int }}r$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the inflow rate. A lick was triggered when &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) reached a fixed threshold &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; = 1. &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; was varied across trials (but constant within each trial) to match the empirically observed distribution of lick times (inverse Gaussian distribution IG(&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;) with &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 and &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; = 12; 10,000 iterations).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In addition to analysing lick-time distributions, we computed the hazard rate, defined as the instantaneous probability of a lick occurring at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, given that no lick has occurred yet. Mathematically, the hazard rate &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is computed as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is the probability density function and &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is the cumulative distribution function of lick times. This measure captures the moment-by-moment drive to lick and provides insight into the temporal dynamics of lick probability. We applied the same procedure to calculate hazard rate in the data. Both the data and the models were binned at 20 ms and smoothed with a boxcar filter over 5 bins. To quantify the temporal shift in hazard rate, we fitted the hazard rate (up to the time point where the cumulative distribution function reaches 80%; beyond that, the hazard function becomes noisier as the denominator becomes small) with a sigmoid function and estimated its 50% point.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We simulated the effects of two types of transient perturbation to the timer: pause (slowdown), in which the inflow rate &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is transiently reduced by the speed coefficient &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ3" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${r}_{\text{during}\text{manipulation}}={c\times r}_{\text{before}\text{manipulation}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Here &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; = 0 represents a complete pause, whereas larger values correspond to a slowdown (0.5 was used in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig6"&gt;6b&lt;/a&gt;). By contrast, in rewind, the timer state &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) is transiently decreased as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$T(t)=T({t}_{\text{stim}\text{on}})+\underset{{t}_{\text{stim}\text{on}}}{\overset{{t}_{\text{stim}\text{off}}}{\int }}{r}_{\mathrm{decay}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;decay&lt;/sub&gt; is a negative value, and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;stim on&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;stim off&lt;/sub&gt; are the times of stimulation on and off, respectively. If &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) &amp;lt; 0, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) was set to zero. If &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) remained at zero for more than 320 ms, it was fixed at zero for the remainder of the trial, resulting in a no-lick outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In all cases, the manipulation lasted for 600 ms and linearly decayed over the final 300 ms, matching the experimental condition. These manipulations were applied across 10,000 trials to assess their effects on lick timing and hazard rate dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

The median absolute deviation of lick time explained by different regression models was calculated as 1 − R1/R2, where R1 is the median of the absolute value of the model residuals, and R2 is the median of the absolute value of the null model residuals.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar4"&gt;Correlation in neural population activity&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To plot the correlation in neural population activity, we calculated the mean spike activity of individual neurons across trials with different lick-time ranges to yield a population activity matrix, with the number of rows equal to the number of neurons and the number of columns equal to the number of time points (200-ms bin). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, we calculated pairwise Pearson’s correlation of these population activity matrices between trials with lick times between 1.40 s and 1.55 s (reference trials) and the trials with other lick-time ranges. For Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, we compared the pairwise Pearson’s correlation between unperturbed trials with lick times between 1.4 s and 1.7 s (reference trials) and the photostimulation trials with lick times between 1.7 s and 2.0 s). As a control, we subselected unperturbed trials with lick times closest to the median lick time in the unperturbed condition (the number of trials was matched to the number of trials as in the photostimulation condition). The choice of reference trials did not qualitatively change the results. For each correlation matrix, we identified the points along the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; axis with the maximum correlation (above 0.8) for each time point, and repeated this procedure with the hierarchical bootstrap (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig3"&gt;3d,i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4g,k&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5i,m&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar5"&gt;Single-cell analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To plot the PSTH of example cells, PSTHs were calculated based on 1-ms time bin and smoothed with a 200-ms causal boxcar filter unless specified otherwise. To temporally warp PSTH for individual cells, we linearly scaled the spike timing after the cue, based on the time from cue to lick. Specifically, Spike time&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; = Spike time&lt;sub&gt;original&lt;/sub&gt;/(LT&lt;sub&gt;trial to be warped&lt;/sub&gt;/LT&lt;sub&gt;target warp time&lt;/sub&gt;), where LT denotes the first lick time in each trial, and LT&lt;sub&gt;target warp time&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 s.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Across-trial variance (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig8"&gt;2e–g&lt;/a&gt;) was calculated as the variance of spiking activity across trials for the original or temporally warped data (the across-trial variance was calculated for five 200-ms time windows after the cue and then averaged).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To quantify the number of cells that significantly increase or decrease spike rate before the lick compared with baseline, the trial-averaged spike rate of 0.2–0.5 s before the lick was compared with that of 0–1 s before the cue. Signed-rank tests were performed to determine whether the spike rate difference was significant.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To calculate the proportion of cells affected or unaffected by photostimulation (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4c&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5e&lt;/a&gt;), we analysed the spikes within the time window of 50–250 ms from the photostimulation onset time. To quantify the effect of photostimulation, trials with licks before the photostimulation onset time were excluded from the analysis. For individual cells, the spike rate in control and photostimulation trials was compared using the two-sided rank-sum test. Cells with a mean spike rate above 1 Hz during this window and more than 10 trials per condition were analysed.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig8"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the partial rank correlation between the spike rate (in specific time windows) and the lick time in previous trials, removing the effect of upcoming lick time, for each cell (we only analysed trials after rewarded trials to avoid confound caused by the representation of rewards; analysis of previous unrewarded trials yielded similar results). Specifically, we calculated the rank correlation between spike rate (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) versus previous lick time (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\rho {RP}\)&lt;/span&gt;), rank correlation between &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; versus upcoming lick time (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\rho {RU}\)&lt;/span&gt;) and rank correlation between &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\rho {PU}\)&lt;/span&gt;). Then, the partial correlation between spike rate versus lick time in the previous trial removing the effect of upcoming lick time is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\rho {RP}\cdot U=\frac{\rho {RP}-\rho {RU}\cdot \rho {PU}}{\sqrt{1-{\rho }^{2}{RU}}\sqrt{1-{\rho }^{2}{PU}}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;As controls, we performed a trial shuffle test, which shuffles the trial order and destroys trial history, and a session permutation test to avoid the confound of nonsensical correlations (1,000 iterations)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Harris, K.

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar6"&gt;Single-cell ramping characterization&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig8"&gt;2a–d&lt;/a&gt;, cells with more than 50 trials of lick time between 1.25 s and 1.5 s were used for firing pattern characterization. For each cell, PSTH was smoothed with a 200-ms causal boxcar filter. Trials were randomly split into halves and averaged to generate train and test data. We fit the activity of the train data from cue onset to the first lick time with different orders of polynomial functions (MATLAB polyfit function; tested order 1–8). We then calculated the mean squared error between the fit and the test data. The ‘best-fit order’ is the one with the lowest mean squared error. We repeated this procedure 10 times and defined the final order as the most frequent order among the 10 iterations. The best-fit data were then used to determine the monotonicity and the peak firing time of the cell. Monotonic firing cells are those whose derivative of the best polynomial fit remains consistently positive or negative values from cue onset to lick. Peak firing time was the time point between the cue and lick where the best polynomial fit had the highest firing rate.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar7"&gt;Dimensionality reduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We characterized population activity patterns between the cue and the lick by defining modes that differentiate the baseline activity during the ITI (0–1 s before the cue) from the activity during specific 300-ms time windows after the cue: 0–0.3 s after the cue (cue mode), 0.5–0.8 s before the lick (middle mode), 0.2–0.5 s before the lick (ramp mode) and 0–0.3 s after the lick (execution mode).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Specifically, to calculate ramp mode for a population of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; recorded neurons, we looked for an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; × 1 unit vector that maximally distinguished the mean activity before the trial onset (0–1 s before cue; &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before cue&lt;/sub&gt;) and the mean activity before the first lick (0.2–0.5 s before the first lick; &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before lick&lt;/sub&gt;) in the &lt;i&gt;n-&lt;/i&gt;dimensional activity space. We defined a population ramping vector: &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before lick&lt;/sub&gt; – &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;before cue&lt;/sub&gt;. Ramp mode is &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; normalized by its norm. Similarly, we defined cue mode, middle mode and execution mode using different time windows, and middle mode was orthogonalized to ramp mode, and cue mode was orthogonalized to both middle mode and ramp mode using the Gram–Schmidt process. Thus, the upper limit of the sum of square sum of task-modulated spiking activity explained (cue mode + middle mode + ramp mode) in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; is 1. Execution mode was orthogonalized to ramp mode (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To define the trial-history mode, we first calculated the predicted lick time in each trial by applying the linear regression model described in the ‘Trial-history regression analysis’ section for each recorded session. Specifically, the model included previous lick times and the interaction between previous lick time and outcome at lags 1 and 2. This predicted value estimates what the lick time would be if it were determined solely by recent behavioural history and reinforcement, according to the fitted regression model, thereby summarizing trial history as a single value for each trial. We then calculated the Spearman rank correlation between the spike rate during the ITI (0–1 s before the cue) and the predicted lick time across trials for each neuron, indicating how strongly the ITI activity for each neuron encodes trial history. We obtained an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; × 1 unit vector representing the rank correlation of each neuron and normalized it by its norm to calculate the trial-history mode. Trial-history mode is not orthogonalized to any other modes.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;In Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5a–c&lt;/a&gt;, we have pooled cells recorded across sessions (that is, pseudo-sessions). For each cell, we randomly selected 50 unperturbed control trials to define the mode. These unperturbed trials met the following criteria: the first lick occurred within 1–3 s after the cue, and there were no licks 3 s before the cue onset. Then, we selected a different set of trials to project the activity along these modes. Only neurons with more than 10 trials within all six lick time ranges were included. The six lick time ranges were: 0.80–1.10 s, 1.10–1.25 s, 1.25–1.40 s, 1.40–1.55 s, 1.55–1.70 s and 1.70–2.00 s.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To calculate the square sum of spiking activity explained by individual modes (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we calculated the square sum of the activity along individual modes after subtracting the baseline activity (0–0.2 s before the cue), and then divided that by the square sum of the spike rate across neurons after subtracting the baseline activity. For each lick time range, we averaged across at least 10 trials with lick times within that range, and spiking data for each trial were smoothed using a 200-ms causal boxcar filter. To calculate the square sum of spiking activity explained by the sum of cue mode, middle mode and ramp mode reported in the main text, we calculated the square sum of task-modulated spiking activity explained between 0.2 s from cue (around when task modulation started) to lick for individual lick time ranges and then averaged across them. We calculated the square sum of spiking activity explained by trial-history mode activity similarly but without subtraction of the baseline activity (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5a–c&lt;/a&gt;). In Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt;, we performed a linear regression analysis between trial-history mode activity during 0–1 s before the cue and the upcoming lick time for each iteration of the hierarchical bootstrap. We then plotted the distribution of the linear regression coefficient (slope) across these iterations as a cumulative distribution function.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To calculate the angle between activity modes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig9"&gt;3m&lt;/a&gt;), we computed the cosine similarity between two vectors of interest. Because cosine similarity depends on vector dimensionality (tending towards orthogonality as the number of neurons increases), we assessed statistical significance by shuffling one of the vectors and recalculating cosine similarity. This allowed us to determine whether the observed alignment between modes exceeded chance levels.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar8"&gt;Single-session analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For analyses based on single sessions (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig10"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig11"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig13"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig14"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig16"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig18"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), sessions with more than 300 trials and five neurons were analysed. Spiking activity was binned per 50-ms time window. Activity between 1 s before the cue and the first lick in each trial was analysed (that is, post-lick activity was excluded as we focused on timing dynamics before the first lick). Dimensionality reduction was performed in the same manner as in the pseudo-session analysis, but modes were defined individually for each session. To visualize the time course of activity (for example, Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;), trials across sessions were pooled based on lick time, and only lick-time ranges that exist in at least two-thirds of the analysed sessions were shown. Therefore, the plotted lick-time ranges vary depending on the manipulation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To decode the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;to lick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; from simultaneously recorded neural population activity, we conducted a kNN regression analysis. Within each experimental session, trials were partitioned into two sets: a test set comprising randomly selected 100 unperturbed trials and all perturbed trials, and a training set consisting of the remaining trials. For each moment in a test trial (50-ms window), we searched all time points in the training set to identify &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; data points with the most similar population activity patterns (Mahalanobis distance based on the top principal components explaining 90% of variance). To estimate the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;to lick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of the test set, we averaged the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;to lick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; in these kNNs. We tested ‘&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;’ values between 20–50 (which are close to the square root of the number of data points in the training dataset) and found that they yielded similar results and did not change conclusions (data not shown). In the paper, we have reported the results with &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 30. Some sessions showed low decodability due to a small number of recorded neurons, trials and/or lack of task-modulated cells (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig10"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;). We analysed sessions in which the kNN decodability (Pearson’s correlation between decoded lick time at the perturbation onset time, that is, 0.6 s after the cue versus actual lick time) was higher than 0.35.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To analyse the effect of perturbations systematically, we compared unperturbed versus perturbed trials after matching the number of trials and decoded time at the perturbation onset time (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig13"&gt;7a,c,d,e,g–i,k–m,o,p&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig18"&gt;12e,i&lt;/a&gt;). Specifically, we randomly resampled animals, sessions and trials hierarchically (hierarchical bootstrap; 1,000 iterations). For each perturbed trial in each bootstrap iteration, we identified an unperturbed trial within the same session with the closest decoded time at the perturbation onset time (0.6 s after the cue). Then, we pooled these trials. This procedure allowed us to examine how decoded time (and projection along each mode) changed after the perturbation in conditions where their activity patterns were similar before the perturbation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For the two-dimensional plots (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig5"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;) and two-dimensional vector field analysis (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig17"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;), we analysed how activity evolves in the two-dimensional space defined by ramp mode and middle mode. Spiking activity was binned in 50-ms time windows, and activity between the cue and the first lick in each trial was analysed. For each session, we projected the activity of ALM neurons along ramp mode and middle mode. The projection was normalized by the standard deviation of activity among control trials, but was not subtracted by the mean so that 0 represents 0 spike activity. For individual activity state (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) in control trials, we calculated the vector &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{x}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt; representing the direction that activity evolves in the next time point (50-ms time bin) in the two-dimensional state. Then, we calculated the mean vector for individual states in the two-dimensional space by averaging all vectors within a spatial bin of 0.5 along both the middle mode and ramp mode axes (if the spatial bin contained more than 30 data points): &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{XY}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; denote the location of the state along the middle mode and ramp mode axes, respectively. Similarly, we acquired the vector field during inhibition by pooling all time points during inhibition (100–400 ms from the inhibition onset) in photostimulation trials to acquire &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{XY}^{\mathrm{stim}}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then, we calculated the direction between &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({r}_{XY}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{XY}^{\mathrm{stim}}\)&lt;/span&gt; for all states where both control and stim vectors exist. We excluded points where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{r}}}_{XY}^{\mathrm{control}}\)&lt;/span&gt; is within &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\pi /6\)&lt;/span&gt; from tanh(&lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;) because if the activity is evolving against the zero point under control conditions, we cannot distinguish between whether the activity is rewinding or moving towards the zero point during the inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Network models&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a dynamical systems approach, we considered four variables representing the average membrane currents (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) and spike rates (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) is the neural activation function) of neuronal populations in the ALM and striatum. Conceptually, in these models, the striatum represents both connections within the striatum and the subcortical loop via the thalamus, which is why there are excitatory connections. In these models, the membrane potential of neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({h}_{i}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, was governed by the following non-linear differential equation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\tau \frac{{{dh}}_{i}(t)}{{dt}}=-{h}_{i}(t)+\sum {W}_{{ij}}{r}_{j}(t)+{I}_{i}^{\mathrm{base}}(t)+{I}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}(t)+{I}_{i}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equ7" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${r}_{i}(t)=f({h}_{i}(t))$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; is the membrane time constant (10 ms), &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;ij&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the element of the connectivity matrix between the presynaptic neuron &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; and the postsynaptic neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{base}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the baseline input current, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{ext}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the external input current, and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the negative current mediated by optogenetics to neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. The membrane current &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({h}_{i}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; was converted to the spike rate by applying a threshold-linear activation function &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) = max(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For integrators mediated by a positive-feedback loop (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), we modelled two neurons in each brain area. The baseline input currents were chosen so that the system displays a stable fixed point at a low spike rate (lower attractor) with a spike rate of 5 spikes per second, consistent with the baseline firing rate observed in the experimental data. The connectivity matrix &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; and the external input &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}^{\mathrm{ext}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; are shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. In these models, temporal integration is mediated by a continuous attractor, achieved by having an eigenvalue of 1 in the connectivity matrix. For each area, we defined the ramp mode using the same criteria as in the experimental data, and we then plotted spike rate activity along the ramp mode (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested models with different connectivity matrices reflecting distinct computational roles of the ALM and striatum (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). In the externally driven model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;), the ALM received a ramping input that scaled with the desired lick times, progressively shifting the location of the fixed point in time. In the distributed model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;), integration was achieved only when interareal connections between the ALM and striatum exist; in the absence of these long-range connections, neither the ALM nor striatum displayed slow-temporal dynamics. Conversely, in the redundant model, the ALM and striatum implemented two identical integrators (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;). Although weakly connected, their behaviour was independent of each other’s input. In the specialized ALM integrator model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;), the ALM served as the integrator, whereas the striatum followed ALM dynamics. In the specialized ALM leaky integrator model (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;), the ALM integrated the input with substantial leakiness. Although this model replicated the rewinding effect of striatal inhibition, it failed to reproduce the effect of ALM silencing. The model that best matched the neural dynamics observed in our data featured the striatum as a perfect integrator and the ALM as a crucial input region (specialized striatum integrator; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic transient perturbation experiments, the negative current was introduced at 0.6 s after the cue and lasted for 0.6 s, including a 300-ms ramp down. For prolonged perturbations, the negative current was applied throughout the trial without a ramp down. To simulate ALM silencing, both ALM neurons (A1 and A2 in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) received a negative current &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; = −10. To stimulate D1-SPN inhibition, we injected a negative current into one of the striatum neurons (S1). To maintain similar perturbation effects on striatal ramp mode activity across different conditions, the negative current for D1-SPN inhibition was varied across models as follows: −0.3, −0.1, −0.1, −0.2, −0.02 and −0.03 for Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1a–f&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate ramping activity with a feedforward network (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig15"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;), we used recurrent network modules composed of four or two cells, connected in a feedforward manner. In these models, the recurrent network modules have an architecture similar to that of the feedback model in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, but with weaker recurrent connections (eigenvalue &amp;lt; 1), such that each stage does not function as a perfect integrator. Thus, feedforward connections between stages are essential to amplify the input and generate both ramping and sequential activity. To implement temporal scaling, we provided a global inhibition to neurons in the feedforward network, that is, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}_{i}^{\mathrm{base}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, was set to negative. This allows activity to propagate from one neuron to another when the effect of excitatory input exceeds this inhibition. Consequently, the speed of dynamics is controlled by the strength of the step input into the network. The step input is provided to an ALM neuron (except in model &lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt;, the striatal integrator model, where it is provided to the STR neuron) in the first recurrent module, allowing it to be amplified by both recurrent and feedforward connections. In addition to the step input, we also provided a transient, cue-like input to both ALM neurons (600-ms duration with 450-ms linear ramp down). This input does not get amplified by the recurrent architecture, as it is provided along an axis orthogonal to the one amplified by the recurrent connections (as in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig15"&gt;9a&lt;/a&gt;). This helps to generate a robust cue-related response in the model, similar to the experimental data. The connectivity matrix &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt; and input are described in detail in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. Transient perturbations were simulated similarly to the positive-feedback network. For ALM complete silencing, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({I}^{\mathrm{stim}}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; = −10 was injected into all ALM neurons. To simulate D1-SPN inhibition, a negative current was injected into half of the striatal neurons (s2 and s3; the result did not change regardless of the choice of two inhibited neurons). To maintain similar perturbation effects on striatal ramp mode activity across different conditions, the negative current for D1-SPN inhibition was varied across models as shown in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. For each area, we defined the ramp and other modes using the same criteria as in the experimental data, and we then plotted spike rate activity along these modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramp mode activity was normalized across conditions so that a value of 0 corresponds to the baseline firing rate (5 Hz) of the target neuron (in the positive-feedback model, the target neuron is neuron 3 in all cases, or neuron 4 in the ALM leaky integrator model; in the feedforward model, the target neuron is the ALM neuron in the last recurrent network module), whereas a value of 1 corresponds to the time point when the activity of the target neuron reaches 10 Hz, approximating the activity level just before licking in our data. Thus, the absolute spike rate of the target neuron can be inferred from its activity along the ramp mode, providing a direct mapping between model output and population activity. For the lick time analysis in Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig7"&gt;1g&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#Fig15"&gt;9e&lt;/a&gt;, the lick time was defined as when the ramp mode activity reached a value of 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample sizes were similar to the sample sizes used in the field. No statistical methods were used to determine the sample size. During spike sorting, experimenters could not tell the trial type and, therefore, were blind to conditions. All signed-rank and rank-sum tests were two sided. All bootstrapping was done over 1,000 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09778-2#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 16:05:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5idExTUUFCVjZPT0Y3RWRpeFNvaDc3YnZpM0ZvWUh0cmhfd21sRXFGLVBBNEVMS0VxeW83RkZ4M0lMcTVRUnJOaVM4Mno3eWtmY2VrVGlTbmlsakZGS2pB</guid></item><item><title>突破性糖尿病治疗可通过护肤霜提供胰岛素- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-diabetes-treatment-may-deliver-insulin-through-a-skin-cream</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/insulin-isnt-just-made-by-the-pancreas-heres-another-location-few-know-about"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; delivery could one day spell an end to the invasive needles on which many people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-key-way-of-consuming-sugar-could-spike-your-diabetes-risk"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; rely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice, minipigs, and lab-grown human skin samples, scientists have demonstrated a topical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-easier-way-to-take-insulin-but-it-hasnt-been-tested-on-people-yet"&gt;insulin treatment&lt;/a&gt; – an achievement long assumed impossible due to the large size of insulin molecules and their strong attraction to water, which prevents them from slipping through the skin's oily outer layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09729-x"&gt;writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by scientists at Zhejiang University in China, "relieving patients with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182252" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery of drugs through the skin has many benefits. It's easy to do at home, is pain-free, and ensures a controlled, gentle release into the body. However, skin is, by design, a barrier that helps protect your body from harmful substances. Its outer barrier, the stratum corneum, consists of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stratum-corneum"&gt;multiple layers of dead skin cells&lt;/a&gt; glued together &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000441540"&gt;by fats and oils&lt;/a&gt;, or lipids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topical drugs work around the skin's defenses; they have small molecules that slip through the skin easily, as well as an ability to interact with the lipids they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin – the hormone that regulates glucose levels – has neither of these properties. The molecules are on the larger side and have a &lt;a href="https://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring2005/Dresser/YFPright.html"&gt;water-loving (hydrophilic) exterior&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them chemically incompatible with the skin's oils. Rather than sliding past or through the oils, they bounce off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds impenetrable, but the researchers thought another property of skin may help insulin enter: its acidity. Skin naturally has a pH gradient, starting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2340/0001555574375379"&gt;slightly acidic at the surface&lt;/a&gt; and rising towards pH neutrality in deeper layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set to work engineering a delivery system that would interact with this gradient to admit the insulin as a plus-one to the exclusive body club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is based on a polymer called poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate], or OP, the properties of which change with shifting pH levels, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.201300043"&gt;shown to be biocompatible&lt;/a&gt; in earlier tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface of the skin, OP has a positive charge, which allows it to stick to skin lipids. However, at neutral pH, it loses that charge and lets go of the lipids, by which point it has slipped through the skin barrier and into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binding insulin to the OP polymer as a conjugate called OP-1 allows the all-important hormone treatment to hitchhike through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good in theory, right? Well, it sounds even better in practice. In human skin models and diabetic mice, OP-I was more effective at carrying insulin past the skin than insulin alone or insulin combined with a different polymer, PEG, as a control. PEG &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2016.1182485"&gt;is widely used&lt;/a&gt; across a range of pharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mice, the treatment brought blood glucose concentrations to normal levels within an hour with an efficacy on par with insulin injections. The levels then remained stable for 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was diabetic minipigs, which are biologically more similar to humans than mice are. The effects were comparable. The pigs' blood glucose levels dropped to normal within two hours and also remained stable for 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it gets inside the body, OP–I accumulates in key glucose-regulating tissues, including the liver, fat, and skeletal muscles, where cells take up the conjugate and release the insulin inside. OP-I activates insulin receptors and enhances glucose uptake and metabolism, just like injected insulin does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, it does so in a more sustained manner than injected insulin, resulting in a smoother, more prolonged effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no signs of inflammation, suggesting that the treatment may confer minimal, if any, harmful side effects – although we'd have to wait for stronger human testing to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the results could mean that frequent insulin injections may one day be a thing of the past. And the system may even work with other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The OP conjugation," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2016.1182485"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;, "is versatile for transdermal delivery of biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins and nucleic acids, with broad therapeutic applications, warranting further investigation in future studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2016.1182485"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep beneath the Earth’s surface, researchers have stumbled upon something truly remarkable: &lt;strong&gt;pockets of water&lt;/strong&gt; that have been trapped for over a billion years. It may sound like the plot of a science fiction novel, but this discovery, made in a Canadian mine, could hold secrets not just about life on Earth, but also about the possibility of life on other planets. It’s &lt;strong&gt;old&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; salty&lt;/strong&gt;, and definitely &lt;strong&gt;not something you’d want to drink&lt;/strong&gt;, but the fact that it’s still there, preserved in isolation for so long, is raising some eyebrows in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The water, &lt;strong&gt;extracted from a zinc and copper mine &lt;/strong&gt;near Timmins, Ontario, is so ancient that scientists are still processing the magnitude of what it might mean. This liquid could potentially house microscopic life forms, living in a kind of time capsule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water That’s Older Than Civilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.es.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/barbara-sherwood-lollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Barbara Sherwood Lollar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, an Earth sciences professor at the University of Toronto, first suspected the presence of ancient water deep in the Timmins mine, she didn’t quite expect the results that followed. What initially seemed like a hunch turned into a groundbreaking discovery. With the help of a team of British researchers who developed a method to measure the build-up of noble gas isotopes, they managed to pinpoint the water’s age. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the findings &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;strong&gt;somewhere between 1.5 and 2.6 billion years old&lt;/strong&gt;. This water could be nearly as old as the Earth itself. Trapped in fractures of rock that date back to the time when the Earth &lt;strong&gt;was still a young planet&lt;/strong&gt;, this find could have been sealed in isolation when the area was submerged under &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2017/03/asteroid-impacts-spawned-colossal-500-foot-high-tsunamis-in-mars-ancient-oceans/" data-type="post" data-id="8703"&gt;ancient oceans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that such a small, isolated pocket of water could survive all this time, almost untouched, raises interesting questions about Earth’s deep past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not the Water You’d Want to Drink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, before you start imagining a cold drink of water from the deep Earth, here’s the catch: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/07/oldest-water-on-earth-was-found/" data-type="post" data-id="95925"&gt;this water is not only undrinkable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s also quite dangerous for humans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As explained by&lt;em&gt; Sherwood Lollar&lt;/em&gt;, the fluid is warm, and it’s much saltier than seawater. But that’s not all, it’s also filled with&lt;strong&gt; dissolved hydrogen, methane&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;noble gases&lt;/strong&gt;. While it sounds like the recipe for a science experiment gone wrong, these gases could provide energy for microscopic life forms to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not the kind you’d casually dip your hand into, its unique chemical composition could help researchers understand how life might survive in&lt;strong&gt; similar extreme conditions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Beneath the Surface: What It Means for Mars&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If life can exist in the deep, dark recesses of our planet where sunlight can’t reach, maybe life could be lurking beneath the surface of Mars as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Equally on somewhere like Mars, any life that formed could have found its way into similar pockets of water in the Martian crust, and our work shows that these pockets of water can survive and provide a place for the life to have survived long after the surface of Mars lost its water and became sterile,” said&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris-Ballentine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chris Ballentine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professor of geochemistry at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr.&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/g.holland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Greg Holland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of Lancaster Environment Centre, and the lead author of the study, also points out in a&lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/articles/2014/discovery-of-the-worlds-oldest-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; statement&lt;/a&gt; that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we can be sure of is that we have identified a way in which planets can create and preserve an environment friendly to microbial life for billions of years. This is regardless of how inhospitable the surface might be, opening up the possibility of similar environments in the subsurface of Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
