This year, a new strain of influenza, known as influenza A H3N2 or the subclade K variant, according to &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/aggressive-flu-variant-sweeps-globe-211109238.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:Fox News;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, is spreading rapidly across the globe and in the United States. This week, the &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reported an 8.1% uptick in positive flu tests nationwide, with the new strain leading to &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flu-rising-around-us-experts-184607556.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:a rise in cases and hospitalizations;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;a rise in cases and hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from the inland western states to the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts previously predicted that &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-predict-years-flu-season-120000811.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:this flu season would be more severe;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;this flu season would be more severe&lt;/a&gt; than some previous ones, due to genetic changes to the virus that made it easier to infect people. And with the Southern Hemisphere seeing a rise in the flu subvariant this summer (which is the Southern Hemisphere’s winter, when the flu tends to circulate) experts believed that the same could happen here once our chillier months arrived. Australia, for example, &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/wake-call-australia-worst-flu-230428419.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:broke its national record for;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;broke its national record for&lt;/a&gt; flu cases this year, amid vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, there are things you can do to protect yourself. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of the flu? How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a range of not-so-fun symptoms of the flu, including fever, muscle ache, cough, headache and exhaustion, per &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Some people also experience GI issues, like vomiting and diarrhea, or ear pain. The only way to know for certain that you have the flu is to take a test, after which your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication that can shorten the duration of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One clue that you may have the flu is &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flu-season-officially-doctors-telling-121602089.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:how quickly the symptoms;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;how quickly the symptoms &lt;/a&gt;manifest. While the common cold may develop gradually, with a scratchy throat for a day or two before you really feel unwell, the flu can be quite sudden, causing you to feel fine one moment and awful the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can treat the flu at home with rest, liquids to avoid dehydration that can worsen symptoms and over-the-counter fever reducers and pain medication like ibuprofen. However, if you are experiencing severe symptoms like chest pain, confusion, severe dizziness, shortness of breath or dehydration, seek medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a flu shot effective in preventing the new strain of the flu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the flu vaccine still protects against severe outcomes from the illness, the current version of the shot is not up to date with the latest strain, as the vaccine was formulated before the  current strain started circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, getting vaccinated for the flu is still your best chance at &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flu-shot-040001043.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:preventing severe disease;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;preventing severe disease&lt;/a&gt;. It can also stop you from catching other forms of the flu that it’s a better match for, as different variants still circulate, albeit to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to stay healthy? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are simple measures you can take to prevent the flu. The first?

(And it’s never a good idea to share drinks and food with other people during flu season!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, you can wear a mask when out in crowded places, or if you are immunocompromised or elderly and want an extra layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxOZXc3RWVTY1BmalllbTlfdTNtMlZEcnQtRHlEQzVlbzVhdjZWejJTZEVXYlRQTzhVb080eTJCS256T3ZBa0NnNXMxYnZ5ejRxblBLMzk0M3dzWm9wbzE5YmREWkdzN053TzdhNENvdWZfaHpzYTB6Y3p1bFY5SG51WEQ5RWZRWnU5Nk0zZ1JpOFhoSmNlaDhhWW10ZGVFQ1NXdUxZb1BZQVU1bHBHU0dHcHlUc2hZbVNteHI1U3ZUZTdlMmVJdkgwYnBqTWUxTFY1WGtZMVRGZ0JpOU04cVotTVQ1WWZTNDVaeHV0VWFCbXMtMkU0Z3ZFY1h2RGVrX3lPVWxTbUpYT3U3VW44</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州首次出现2025-2026年流感相关的儿科死亡病例；丹佛卫生局的医生提出建议- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-influenza-pediatric-death-denver-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colorado health officials have confirmed the state's first influenza-associated pediatric death of the 2025-2026 season. The child, who was elementary school-aged and lived in the Denver metro area, died last week, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as flu activity surges statewide. CDPHE reports a 43% increase in flu-related hospitalizations during the last week of November, and pediatricians say they are seeing far more cases than usual this early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, there's about 10 times as much flu as anything else," said Dr. Gregg Kennedy, a pediatrician at Denver Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy added that most children recover at home, but some require hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Annually throughout the whole country, we usually see several hundred pediatric deaths from the flu, and over 90% of them are kids that don't have the flu vaccine," he said. "If I had to give one recommendation to make sure our kids aren't going to die from the flu, the vaccine is going to be a really good idea for that." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools are feeling the impact as well. At Colorado Kids Academy in Lakewood, owner Mara Hackett said the preschool had to close for a day when so many children became ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Children were coming in without any symptoms, and hours later they're developing really high fevers," Hackett said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said about 70% of students were out sick, and staff have returned to COVID-era cleaning protocols to keep families safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our number one thing is keeping kids safe and healthy," Hackett said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to curb the spread, CDPHE will begin sending text messages and emails this week to families of more than 225,000 children ages 6 months to 5 years whose records show they may be overdue for a flu shot. Doctors recommend getting vaccinated as soon as possible, keeping sick children home, and practicing good hygiene. Flu season typically peaks in January and February, but health officials warn this year's early surge could mean a longer, more severe season.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. appointed this year after he fired the previous ones — &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-panel-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccine-babies-rfk-jr-rcna247482" target="_blank"&gt;voted for the recommendation this month&lt;/a&gt;, upending more than three decades of agency guidance. Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill accepted the change Tuesday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— the final step for it to become the agency’s policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-887c24" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are restoring the balance of informed consent to parents whose newborns face little risk of contracting hepatitis B,” O'Neill said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-009d50" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5730a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommended the birth dose of the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; since 1991. Many public health experts criticized the advisory committee’s decision: After the meeting, a chorus of doctors, political leaders and health officials called on O’Neill to ignore the suggested change and maintain the CDC’s recommendation, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5ffb4" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC now suggests waiting until at least 2 months of age for babies’ first hepatitis B shots if they do not receive the birth dose. However, it still recommends that babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection statuses are unknown get hepatitis B vaccines within the first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54f6e3" class="body-graf"&gt;The agency is still reviewing a secondary recommendation from the panel: that parents consult with health care providers about the possibility of testing children for antibodies to hepatitis B before they decide whether to get second doses of the vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given to babies as a three-dose series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-099f08" class="body-graf"&gt;The new policy is one of the most notable examples of the way CDC guidance is diverging from widespread medical consensus. The advisory committee's discussion of hepatitis B vaccines was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisory-panel-delays-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccines-rcna247362" target="_blank"&gt;rife with misinformation and cherry-picked data&lt;/a&gt;, and it ignored decades of evidence that hepatitis B vaccines are safe and effective when they are given shortly after birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-59171c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg" alt="CDC Panel Reverses Call To Give All Newborns Hepatitis B Shot"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Dec. 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Megan Varner / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4fff80" class="body-graf"&gt;Many public health experts say delaying the hepatitis B vaccine until babies are older could lead to a resurgence of infections and possibly more deaths from liver disease or cancer. Pediatric cases of acute hepatitis B plummeted after the CDC began recommending a universal birth dose, falling by &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;99% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Hepatitis B can be passed from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. There is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a33a35" class="body-graf"&gt;“Ending the recommendation for newborns makes it more likely the number of cases will begin to increase again. This makes America sicker,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1996974038413971766" target="_blank"&gt;said on X this month&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy is one of many medical professionals who publicly asked O’Neill not to adopt the advisory panel’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d14eab" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians are expected to keep recommending that parents vaccinate their newborns for hepatitis B. The Department of Health and Human Services has said the new recommendations will not affect insurance coverage of the shots. The vaccine will also continue to be offered to newborns through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free shots for uninsured or underinsured kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4667b" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B decision was the latest in a series of CDC policy changes that have not been backed by science, leading some public health experts to suggest that the agency’s guidance should no longer be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-596283" class="body-graf"&gt;After Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;gutted the long-standing membership&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s vaccine panel — formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — in June, he replaced it with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-793710" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Neill, a former investment executive who does not have a medical background, previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. He became acting CDC director in August after Kennedy abruptly fired the previous director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy said Monarez was fired for being untrustworthy, but Monarez said Kennedy dismissed her for refusing to blindly approve the vaccine advisory panel’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e16f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;altered a webpage&lt;/a&gt; that had once unequivocally said vaccines do not cause autism, claiming instead that studies have not ruled out a link. (In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/do-vaccines-cause-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;decades of research&lt;/a&gt; have found no association.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66c028" class="body-graf"&gt;In October, O’Neill &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/separate-measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-acting-cdc-director-rcna235971" target="_blank"&gt;called on vaccine manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to develop separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella, without evidence to support breaking up the combined vaccine. And in September, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/medicine-and-pregnancy/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;updated its guidance&lt;/a&gt; to tell pregnant women to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;consider avoiding acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; — the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of a possible connection to autism in children.

    &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;are growing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; along the Utah-Arizona border and in South Carolina, where hundreds are in quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between Friday and Tuesday, South Carolina health officials confirmed 27 new measles cases in an outbreak in and around northwestern Spartanburg County. In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the vaccine-preventable virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine — some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state's new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been "very helpful," said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state," Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since August. Mohave County, Arizona, has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit. Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000. Cases have mostly spread among people who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Canada lost that designation — which applies when there is no continuous local spread of the virus — as did the larger health region of the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the U.S. is also at risk of losing that status. For that to happen, measles would have to spread continuously for a year. A large outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico and Oklahoma that started in January sickened nearly 900 and kicked off the United States' worst measles year &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but eight states have logged at least one measles case this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 47 outbreaks this year, compared with 16 in 2024. Three people — two of them Texas school children — have died.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt Medical Center who has served as a liaison to the ACIP, told CBS News in an interview Tuesday that the "simple answer" behind the spread of the outbreaks is that "parents are withholding their children from vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know, vaccination is so very effective that ... by comprehensively vaccinating all of our children, eliminated measles from the United States," Schaffner said, later adding that "we are turning the clock back." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined MMR vaccine is safe and provides 97% protection against the disease after two doses, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. Most children in the U.S. are required to get the MMR shot to attend school. But vaccination rates have declined as more parents waive the shots or have fallen behind on recommended vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-rfk-jr-vote-measles-hepatitis-b/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the CDC's vaccine recommendation committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted to recommend that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, or MMRV, be separated into MMR and varicella shots for children under the age of 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the change after &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;undergoing a complete overhaul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Several of those new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have a history of being vaccine skeptics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline Gounder, while the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between the ages of 14-18 months. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Gounder says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that while febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, they are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window, Gounder says. &lt;/p&gt;

These drugs are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1) receptor agonists, because of the way they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-reshapes-the-kinds-of-food-people-eat-heres-what-happens"&gt;controls appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using health records, the team matched people who had taken one of the weight loss drugs with people who had undergone either of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; operations, based on age, body mass index, and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-diabetes-pill-works-as-well-as-ozempic-for-weight-loss-trial-finds"&gt;New Diabetes Pill Works as Well as Ozempic For Weight Loss, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: people in the surgery group shed an average of 25.7 percent of their total body weight over two years, while those in the medication group lost 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's partly down to patients not sticking to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;their GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;, whereas surgery is more permanent, but the researchers also noticed smaller differences over shorter time frames – the surgery always gave the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg" alt="Ozempic Isn't Actually The Most Effective Option For Weight Loss, Scientists Confirm" class="wp-image-165321 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Semaglutide mimics the body's natural GLP-1 hormone.

GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the study was funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), which would have a vested interest in promoting surgical options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't outright dismissing semaglutide treatments, which also showed beneficial results in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions doubling&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 to 2023, it's crucial to investigate how they compare to established &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/as-well-as-weight-loss-studies-find-bariatric-surgery-also-lowers-the-risk-of-developing-cancer"&gt;surgery methods&lt;/a&gt;, and to figure out which options are best for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While both patient groups lose weight, metabolic and bariatric surgery is much more effective and durable," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; ASMBS President Ann M.

I thought the limp was just me not used to being on my feet, and that after I rested, it would get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It “stopped hurting after a while,” but as the mom of two — she shares Ashton, now 2, and Emma, who will turn 1 on Dec. 28, with her husband Joey — explains, “I had just had a baby a few months before and figured my body was still healing from all of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the Nebraska mom took Ashton to his 2-year wellness visit in June, she mentioned the limp to the doctor, who “called in a favor” to get Decker an appointment with a neurologist.  A month later, Decker’s primary doctor mentioned that she was concerned it could be &lt;a href="https://people.com/sandra-bullock-bryan-randall-als-what-is-it-7570801" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis &lt;/a&gt;— aka, &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebrities-who-have-been-diagnosed-with-als-11713728" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ALS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; — commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. “I knew very little about the diagnosis other than there was no cure,” Decker tells PEOPLE. “Everything I researched online was heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon Runge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Decker with her children Ashton and Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/john-driskell-hopkins-releases-i-love-you-forever-als-update-exclusive-11733525" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ALS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles. Patients first experience twitching or weakness in a limb, as Decker did. The disease affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, so patients slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk, and breathe independently, per to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. There's no cure for ALS, and people usually live three to five years after diagnosis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mda.org/disease/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Muscular Dystrophy Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Muscular Dystrophy Association&lt;/a&gt;. However, some patients can live decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Joey, 35, recalls the moment his wife told him what doctors suspected. "My wife walked in ... out of nowhere, crying a deep, broken cry. I didn't know what was going on, but when I saw her, I dropped my [building] tools, stood up, and just held her tight for a few minutes while she found the space between deep breaths to fit the words into. Once she told me what the doctor thought was going on [ALS]), my heart immediately fell through the floor. Everything we've spent our entire lives working toward crashed beneath us in that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decker says they “cried for hours that first day. We then kept praying that it was something, anything, else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More tests led to Decker being officially diagnosed with ALS on Sept. 2. “Hearing the official diagnosis was just as heartbreaking,” Decker tells PEOPLE. “There are days when life feels normal and I forget for just a few minutes that there is something wrong, and then it will hit me again. We've really had to accept our emotions in our house because at any given moment me or my husband might be crying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family has started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-to-megans-als-journey-and-family-needs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help them pay for the mounting medical bills — and for a necessary move to a home without stairs. As the fundraiser explains, “They're currently renting a single-story home from a friend of theirs but it isn't handicap accessible, and they're getting to a point where that's a functional necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Decker with husband Joey, and children Ashton and Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decker is already struggling to walk. “I am currently using a walker to get around short distances, and if I'm going longer distances, we have an electric wheelchair.” The wheelchair has allowed her to still be present with her family at events like “the pumpkin patch and parades.” As the disease progresses, they plan to rely on adaptive equipment, like “&lt;a href="https://people.com/celebrity/als-patients-communicate-in-their-voices-after-they-lose-ability-to-speak/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:voicebanking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;voicebanking&lt;/a&gt;,” which will allow her to “still be able to communicate with my family and it will be in my ‘voice’ even if it gets to the point that I can no longer speak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, the young couple is trying to help their children cope. “Both of our kids are too young to understand what is going on," Decker says, explaining they tell their toddler “in ways he will understand: ‘Mommy is just sad right now, and that's okay’ or ‘Mommy's legs are feeling weak today so Daddy gets to carry you.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But as Decker shares, her disease is progressing quickly, and “the diagnosis and treatment coming from the doctors is very bleak.” She’s been told, “I will likely not be walking within a year and would guess my life expectancy is three.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon Runge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Decker with husband Joey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My husband and I are supposed to be starting our lives together, not trying to figure out how to help me be more comfortable in the next three years as I slowly lose all function of my body, while my mind is still there. It's not something anyone should have to face. I'm just so thankful for our amazing support system throughout all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decker explains that she's trying to keep positive as much as possible. "I think the hopelessness can contribute to a faster decline, and I want as much time with my kids as possible so I'm focusing on the good. I also don't want them to remember me as bitter or angry, so I'm going to focus on the good and be grateful. There are days this is hard, but that is my goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family will be setting up a donated playground in their yard, she says, so “I can go watch them from our porch and just be involved that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And Joey shares, "I'm still a broken man, and I've accepted that I probably always will be, but Ashton and Emma deserve the best life possible, and our time with mommy may be limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We just want to make as many memories as possible with our children while mommy is still here," he says, "so we can fill our home with reminders that she loves these amazing kids more than they could ever know, while fighting our hardest to keep her around to remind them herself.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/young-mom-of-2-fatigue-heartbreaking-als-exclusive-11868969" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 22:04:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1JQmZwU3R1M3FsVzVQakpuMmxacUYxY3hNUnl3TDdHOE5YeWxpeUxqVVdKVTlvMnhfdGlUODQ5Wk1Jem9lcF9YOWpmU3A3dkFVa2pKVm9yTzBXY1diQVgzRzR6RjBjNThYLVJ3ekFxU2V6MmdWZUE</guid></item><item><title>第二所梅德福学校在胃病突发后取消课程- WCVB</title><link>https://www.wcvb.com/article/st-joseph-school-cancels-classes-stomach-illness-medford/69779812</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						A second school in Medford, Massachusetts, was forced to cancel classes this week after an outbreak of stomach illness. St. Joseph School reported that 20% of its students were absent Monday, prompting the school to cancel Tuesday and Wednesday classes "out of an abundance of caution," according to Boston Archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon.  The school said there are no medical records confirming norovirus, but a "significant number of students (were sent home) with stomach bug symptoms," the school said in a letter to families. The school will use the break from classes to "deep clean and sanitize the school," and help stop the spread of illness before the holidays.Classes are expected to resume Thursday."If you or a family member is feeling sick on Wednesday morning, DO NOT send your child(ren) to school," the school wrote. This is the second school in the city to cancel classes for illness in as many weeks. Roberts School canceled classes last Thursday and Friday after more than 130 students and staff members were absent from class, reporting upset stomach symptoms. Norovirus is a contagious illness with which the affected usually experience sudden symptoms like vomiting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting, diarrhea and foodborne illness in the country.

It’s an eating disorder that’s characterized as an obsession with only consuming “healthy” foods—and it’s on the rise, says Sadi Fox, PhD, a licensed psychotherapist who specializes in eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have that friend who talks a little too much about things like “clean eating,” or that random food group they’re entirely avoiding in pursuit of better health. Think: carbs, sugar, gluten (provided they don’t have an allergy). The problem? Orthorexia can result in nutritional deficiencies, mental health challenges, and social isolation. It can also be a “slippery slope” for other disordered behaviors, Fox says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the signs of orthorexia can be very difficult to identify. Since eating healthy is generally perceived as a good thing, people with orthorexia might be praised for their disorder, not know they have a problem, and not end up getting the help they need—which is the case for some patients who work with Fox. “A lot of people are just like, ‘Whoa, I didn't even realize how deep [into my eating disorder] I was,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to this sneaky mental health condition, signs and symptoms may be hard to spot. Here’s what experts want you to know about orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://flourishpsychologynyc.com/flourish-therapists/#sadi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sadi Fox;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sadi Fox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is a psychotherapist specializing in eating disorders at &lt;a href="https://flourishpsychologynyc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Brooklyn-based private psychotherapy practice. &lt;a href="https://www.weflourishpsychology.com/dr-kelli-rugless-psyd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kelli Rugless;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kelli Rugless&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, is a clinical psychologist and eating disorder specialist at the virtual talk therapy practice &lt;a href="https://www.weflourishpsychology.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.emilyvaneck.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Van Eck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emily Van Eck&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RD, is a dietitian and intuitive eating counselor at &lt;a href="https://www.emilyvaneck.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Van Eck Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emily Van Eck Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is orthorexia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, orthorexia is when eating healthy goes from a goal to an obsession, skewing what “healthy” even means in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With orthorexia, a person becomes so focused on avoiding foods they think are harmful that they end up depriving their body of the nutrition it needs, says Kelli Rugless, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and eating disorder specialist at the private therapy practice Flourish Psychology. It’s important to note that the foods people avoid aren’t always based on good, accurate information. People with orthorexia might make choices based on different approaches they see on social media, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s backed by science, says Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, if you ask a nutritionist, cutting out entire groups of foods, no matter what they are, can result in a pretty unhealthy diet. Because their diets can become so restrictive, people who are orthorexic might lack key nutrients, not get sufficient calories for normal bodily functions, and have digestive issues like constipation, says Emily Van Eck, RD, a nutritionist who works with patients with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not officially recognized in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60722310/what-is-high-functioning-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DSM-5;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DSM-5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the handbook for diagnosing mental disorders), but orthorexia is an eating disorder that has risen significantly over the past few years, according to the experts who treat it. Without formal diagnostic criteria, it’s challenging to determine exactly how many people in the U.S. struggle with orthorexia, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Eating Disorders Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Eating Disorders Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—but prevalence varies across countries and populations, ranging from 6.9% in the Italian population to 88.7% in Brazil, per a 2021 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5488" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Other studies suggest orthorexia might be more common in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram users;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Instagram users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (49% prevalence) &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457720303624" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrition students;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nutrition students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (72% prevalence), and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs40337-023-00739-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69757847%2Forthorexia-eating-disorder%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:populations that exercise;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;populations that exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (55% prevalence). Plus, athletes and endurance athletes (runners especially) have higher symptom severity when it comes to orthorexia, according to a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10710386/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the physical complications that come with orthorexia, the eating disorder is also associated with mental and emotional challenges, including dealing with shame, guilt, fear, and social isolation when it comes to food, says Rugless. “Their relationship with food becomes obsessive,” says Rugless. They might avoid social situations where they can’t control what they eat. Plus, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-062520-122331" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that comes with an eating disorder can ruin your quality of life, says Van Eck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to eating disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anorexia and bulimia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anorexia and bulimia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a person’s primary motivation might be to change the look of their body, orthorexia typically starts with the goal to eat the healthiest foods possible, says Rugless. This goal doesn’t happen in a vacuum, though. “It’s diet culture’s newest attack,” says Fox. Media and social media’s support of things like “clean eating,” different harmful dietary practices, and general health misinformation may contribute to fears about “toxic” foods and could be supporting this uptick in orthorexia, per a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490497/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, social media is playing a role in the increase of this eating disorder, which can have serious consequences on someone’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs And Symptoms Of Orthorexia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you tell if someone is simply eating healthy or dealing with an eating disorder? Look for rigidity, says Rugless. If a friend is dividing foods into black and white categories (like “good” and “bad”) and cutting out entire food groups aside from allergies or religious and cultural traditions, that’s a sign they could be dealing with something deeper. They also might avoid certain restaurants, bring their own food, or refuse to eat altogether if they can’t access a food they’re okay with. They may also spend a lot of time researching food or spending money on health foods they can’t afford, adds Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who struggle with orthorexia tend to focus on not eating anything “harmful,” “damaging,” or “bad,” Rugless says. Instead, they consume foods they believe are “pure,” or “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are a bit moralistic about it,” says Fox. If you have a friend who feels particularly judgy about food—or even about what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; eat—that also might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you or a loved one might be struggling with orthorexic behaviors, it’s always a good idea to talk to a therapist. If you’re not sure, here are some questions Fox tends to ask patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your diet representative of the different food groups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does your diet make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does thinking about eating and food take up a lot of time in your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does what you eat cost an appropriate amount of money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you able to enjoy social gatherings around food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is orthorexia diagnosed and treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since orthorexia is not an official diagnosis in the DSM, there isn’t a set of clear clinical criteria to determine whether a person has it or not. However, if you’re exhibiting any of the above behaviors—like consistently fixating on food that you perceive to be “harmful,” avoiding restaurants, focusing on foods that you feel are “clean,” or any of the other behaviors mentioned, it’s likely a sign that you could be dealing with orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with a licensed therapist and a dietitian can help you navigate this eating disorder, Fox and Rugless say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapists might use &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive behavioral therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CBT)—a type of psychotherapy focused on disrupting unhelpful thought patterns—to help you get back to the basics, make sure all food groups are represented in your diet and work on breaking down some of the ideas you might have about what makes something “healthy.” A dietitian can help make sure you're adequately nourishing your body, all while helping you fight misinformation you might have internalized about food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To See A Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you may be struggling with orthorexia or any other eating disorder, it’s always a good idea to check in with an eating disorder specialist—they can help you, no matter how far along you are. To find one, you can look for therapists who mention specializing in eating disorders in their bios or for a Certified Eating Disorders Specialist (CEDS) or Certified Eating Disorders Registered Dietitian (CEDRD) credential.

It’s an eating disorder that’s characterized as an obsession with only consuming “healthy” foods—and it’s on the rise, says Sadi Fox, PhD, a licensed psychotherapist who specializes in eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;We all have that friend who talks a little too much about things like “clean eating,” or that random food group they’re entirely avoiding in pursuit of better health. Think: carbs, sugar, gluten (provided they don’t have an allergy). The problem? Orthorexia can result in nutritional deficiencies, mental health challenges, and social isolation. It can also be a “slippery slope” for other disordered behaviors, Fox says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Still, the signs of orthorexia can be very difficult to identify. Since eating healthy is generally perceived as a good thing, people with orthorexia might be praised for their disorder, not know they have a problem, and not end up getting the help they need—which is the case for some patients who work with Fox. “A lot of people are just like, ‘Whoa, I didn't even realize how deep [into my eating disorder] I was,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When it comes to this sneaky mental health condition, signs and symptoms may be hard to spot.

It’s important to note that the foods people avoid aren’t always based on good, accurate information. People with orthorexia might make choices based on different approaches they see on social media, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s backed by science, says Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In reality, if you ask a nutritionist, cutting out entire groups of foods, no matter what they are, can result in a pretty unhealthy diet. Because their diets can become so restrictive, people who are orthorexic might lack key nutrients, not get sufficient calories for normal bodily functions, and have digestive issues like constipation, says Emily Van Eck, RD, a nutritionist who works with patients with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s not officially recognized in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60722310/what-is-high-functioning-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60722310/what-is-high-functioning-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DSM-5" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;DSM-5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the handbook for diagnosing mental disorders), but orthorexia is an eating disorder that has risen significantly over the past few years, according to the experts who treat it. Without formal diagnostic criteria, it’s challenging to determine exactly how many people in the U.S. struggle with orthorexia, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Eating Disorders Association" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.3.0"&gt;National Eating Disorders Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—but prevalence varies across countries and populations, ranging from 6.9% in the Italian population to 88.7% in Brazil, per a 2021 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5488" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5488" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health" data-node-id="11.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.5.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.5.0.0"&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.6"&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Other studies suggest orthorexia might be more common in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram users" data-node-id="11.8" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.8.0"&gt;Instagram users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (49% prevalence) &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457720303624" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457720303624" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="nutrition students" data-node-id="11.10" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.10.0"&gt;nutrition students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (72% prevalence), and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40337-023-00739-6" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40337-023-00739-6" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="populations that exercise" data-vars-ga-product-id="436a2df3-0574-471d-8287-bc4381943678" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="11.12" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.12.0"&gt;populations that exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (55% prevalence). Plus, athletes and endurance athletes (runners especially) have higher symptom severity when it comes to orthorexia, according to a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10710386/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10710386/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity" data-node-id="11.14" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.14.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.14.0.0"&gt;Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Beyond the physical complications that come with orthorexia, the eating disorder is also associated with mental and emotional challenges, including dealing with shame, guilt, fear, and social isolation when it comes to food, says Rugless. “Their relationship with food becomes obsessive,” says Rugless. They might avoid social situations where they can’t control what they eat. Plus, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-062520-122331" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-062520-122331" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stress" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that comes with an eating disorder can ruin your quality of life, says Van Eck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Compared to eating disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anorexia and bulimia" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;anorexia and bulimia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a person’s primary motivation might be to change the look of their body, orthorexia typically starts with the goal to eat the healthiest foods possible, says Rugless. This goal doesn’t happen in a vacuum, though. “It’s diet culture’s newest attack,” says Fox. Media and social media’s support of things like “clean eating,” different harmful dietary practices, and general health misinformation may contribute to fears about “toxic” foods and could be supporting this uptick in orthorexia, per a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490497/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490497/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nutrients" data-node-id="13.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="13.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.3.0.0"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, social media is playing a role in the increase of this eating disorder, which can have serious consequences on someone’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-rfu8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Signs And Symptoms Of Orthorexia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;How can you tell if someone is simply eating healthy or dealing with an eating disorder? Look for rigidity, says Rugless. If a friend is dividing foods into black and white categories (like “good” and “bad”) and cutting out entire food groups aside from allergies or religious and cultural traditions, that’s a sign they could be dealing with something deeper. They also might avoid certain restaurants, bring their own food, or refuse to eat altogether if they can’t access a food they’re okay with. They may also spend a lot of time researching food or spending money on health foods they can’t afford, adds Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;People who struggle with orthorexia tend to focus on not eating anything “harmful,” “damaging,” or “bad,” Rugless says. Instead, they consume foods they believe are “pure,” or “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“People are a bit moralistic about it,” says Fox. If you have a friend who feels particularly judgy about food—or even about what &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; eat—that also might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you think you or a loved one might be struggling with orthorexic behaviors, it’s always a good idea to talk to a therapist. If you’re not sure, here are some questions Fox tends to ask patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.0"&gt;Is your diet representative of the different food groups?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.1"&gt;How does your diet make you feel?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.2"&gt;Does thinking about eating and food take up a lot of time in your life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.3"&gt;Does what you eat cost an appropriate amount of money?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.4"&gt;Are you able to enjoy social gatherings around food?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-rfu8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;How is orthorexia diagnosed and treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Since orthorexia is not an official diagnosis in the DSM, there isn’t a set of clear clinical criteria to determine whether a person has it or not.

On a cloudy November day in 2022, her mother, Julie Newman, was about to complete her final round of radiation, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in September. The whole family, a close-knit bunch, was gathering with balloons and signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Freed, then a few weeks shy of her 31st birthday, was carrying a secret. Spurred by her mother’s diagnosis, she had her first mammogram a couple days earlier, and it had turned up a suspicious spot. Now she needed a second, diagnostic mammogram, and likely a biopsy. She found herself walking a surreal sort of tightrope, caught between relief that her mother’s treatment was over and fear that she might soon be starting her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I went to the radiation center that morning, celebrated my mom having her last radiation treatment, had breakfast with everyone,” she recalls. “And then quietly went back to the medical campus, to the building across the street, to have my next set of scans and imagery done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two weeks later, on 9 December 2022, Freed learned she had an early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Telling her mom, she says, was excruciating: “I just remember being like, I don’t want to give her this news, but I also cannot keep this from her.” Just three months out from her own diagnosis, Newman, now 68, was shocked. “It was like a kick in the stomach,” she says. “I couldn’t believe it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-double-diagnoses-can-affect-families" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How double diagnoses can affect families&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Newman pivoted from patient to caregiver, helping Freed’s husband with the couple’s two-year-old daughter while Freed recovered from her double mastectomy. Then Newman learned she needed a second lumpectomy, and Freed checked on her frequently; Newman set up a meal train for Freed from her recovery chair. It was a relentless rush of role-switching, says Freed, based on who was feeling better that day: “It felt like we were living through hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Back-to-back cancer diagnoses can have a profound psychological impact, unearthing sadness, helplessness and fear, says Dr Neha Goyal, a clinical psychologist at the University of California at San Francisco’s Helen Diller Family Comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="541680a8-0296-4b43-9f11-2094bb4ee26e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Julie Newman and her daughter, Genna Newman Freed, at Julie’s home in Findlay, Ohio, on 17 November.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Amy Lynn Powell/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When someone – let alone two members of the same family – is navigating a cancer diagnosis, “there’s such a sense of loss of control”, she says. The people rallying around them may grapple with their own anxiety, grief and exhaustion. “It affected the whole family,” agrees Newman. “It was a very trying time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="feeling-powerless-to-protect" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling powerless to protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last January, three weeks into recovery from her own double mastectomy, Janet Parks, 62, found out that her 36-year-old daughter had breast cancer. “That was harder than my own diagnosis,” she says. “As a mother, your job is to protect your child at all costs, and I couldn’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/facts-statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;majority &lt;/a&gt;of breast cancers occur in women with no family history, “we know that women who have breast cancer in their family have an elevated risk”, says Dr Nan Chen, a breast medical oncologist at the University of Chicago. In fact, having a first-degree relative like a mother, daughter or sister who develops breast cancer &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/breast-cancer-risk-factors-you-cannot-change.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost doubles&lt;/a&gt; your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-ovarian-cancer-hereditary/causes/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;5% to 10%&lt;/a&gt; of breast cancers are totally hereditary in that they result directly from a mutated gene – like &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet#what-are-brca1-and-brca2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;BRCA1, BRCA2&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/other-breast-cancer-gene-mutations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; – passed down from parent to child, says Chen. About &lt;a href="https://youngandstrong.dana-farber.org/genetics.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;15% to 20%&lt;/a&gt; are considered “familial”, she says, meaning that while no specific gene mutation has been identified, there is still a family link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="547cc3fa-4a7e-4d90-866a-f08e0dbf98dc" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Janet Parks and her daughter, Alicia Schlossberg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A woman with a BRCA mutation faces &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/brca1-and-brca2-mutations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 45% to 85% risk &lt;/a&gt;of developing breast cancer by age 70, compared with the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;average lifetime risk&lt;/a&gt; of about 13%. Parks’s daughter, Alicia Schlossberg, inherited the BRCA-2 mutation from her mother; her chance of passing it down to her own daughters, aged 2 and 5, is &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/risk-assessment-screening/genetic-counseling-and-testing/hereditary-cancer-genes-and-hereditary-cancer-syndromes/brca1-and-brca2-genes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50%&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m obviously very nervous that this is going to be their reality someday,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Freed too is concerned about her daughter’s future. She inherited a BRCA-2 mutation from her father’s side, and wants to give her five-year-old daughter the choice to be tested for it when she’s older. The weight of the genetic gamble keeps her up at night, she says: “Am I borrowing all of this worry from tomorrow for nothing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="same-diagnosis-different-experiences" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same diagnosis, different experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The median age of diagnosis is 62, but breast cancer rates in younger women are &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-young-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;steadily rising&lt;/a&gt;; about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bring-your-brave/breast-cancer-in-young-women/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/breast_cancer_young_women/index.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;10%&lt;/a&gt; of new breast cancer cases in the United States occur in women under the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Younger women &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-young-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tend to be diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; when their breast cancer has progressed to a later stage, and with more aggressive subtypes that require chemotherapy. But beyond the practical disparities, getting breast cancer in your 30s versus your 60s is “emotionally and psychosocially a completely different experience”, Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lindsey Baker was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in December 2020 at the age of 35. The week of Baker’s double mastectomy in 2021, her mother, Shelley Pozez, learned she had breast cancer, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It felt like a similar experience, but on a very different path,” says Baker. She was single, lived alone and dreaded the intricacies of dating after cancer treatment; her mother had a supportive long-term partner. Pozez, then 66, already had children; Baker – who inherited the BRCA-1 mutation, which also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5527889/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raises the risk&lt;/a&gt; of ovarian cancer, from her father’s side – made the tough decision to remove her ovaries, surrendering her fertility and plunging prematurely into menopause. Pozez was retired at diagnosis; Baker, who was the chief operating officer of two non-profits, worked throughout treatment, bringing her laptop to all 16 rounds of chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="134bcefa-a79a-4777-b9e0-ef11f61edb88" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Lindsey Baker and Shelley Pozez in August 2025 at a family reunion in Atlanta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Risk of recurrence is nuanced and depends on various factors. But Baker’s cancer, caught later than Pozez’s, was also growing more aggressively. “I think the chances of mine coming back are higher,” she says. “That still weighs on me differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baker and Pozez diverged when it came to discussing what they were going through, too. While Baker drew solace from hearing other women’s experiences and sharing her own, her mom “was just a lot more private about it”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Similarly, Freed is more candid about her cancer journey than her mother. After her mastectomy, she opted for a form of breast reconstruction called &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/going-flat-no-reconstruction/aesthetic-flat-closure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aesthetic flat closure&lt;/a&gt;. “If somebody’s like: ‘Hey, what does a flat closure look like?’, I’m like: ‘Do you want me to take off my shirt?’” she says. “If my mom were in that boat, she’d be like: ‘You want me to do what now?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sylvia Morrison, 61, handled her breast cancer diagnosis in 2011 the way she’d seen her mother handle one several years before. “She didn’t really talk about it,” she says. “She showed no fear, no concern.” It was only when Morrison’s daughter, Monisha Parker, was diagnosed three years later at age 28 that she recognized that there might be another way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1ad4ad96-f415-47a6-9fe0-23b817514dad" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Monisha Parker and her mother, Sylvia Morrison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was a lot more open and willing to share my story,” says Parker, who started a blog, &lt;a href="https://purposepaintedpink.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Purpose Painted Pink&lt;/a&gt;, about her experience as a young cancer patient. “I definitely think it’s a generational thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morrison, whose cancer recurred in 2019, has regrets about her prior stoicism. “I’m still dealing with the mental part of breast cancer,” she says. “I’m over the physical part of it, but the mental part of it I didn’t deal with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Watching her daughter’s response to cancer has encouraged Morrison to voice her emotions more often, in all aspects of life: “Monisha dealt with both sides of it, which I applaud her for, because she did something I didn’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-benefits-of-mutual-support" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of mutual support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morrison worried, would her cancer experience scare her daughter? “But I think it had the opposite effect,” she says. “Once she got over the initial shock, she was able to draw strength because I went through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the spring of 2022, Allison Mertzman, now 40, was recovering from chemo and undergoing radiation for breast cancer, when she learned that her mother, Susan Pearlman, now 66, had the disease, too. “I was in such survival mode at that point that I was like: ‘Alright, hop on my boat, we’ve got to survive this together,’” she says. “We almost became teammates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Already close, the two traded advice, words of encouragement and even post-mastectomy garments. Now that they’re both cancer-free, Pearlman says, she worries every time Mertzman goes in for a scan. “But I also know what that’s like. I feel the same thing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6cdd7503-34a3-4bf0-af1e-4a1fa9486d8e" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--supporting element-supporting dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Allison Mertzman and her mom, Susan Pearlman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Weathering a life-changing illness alongside a loved one can often be “a source of even stronger connection”, says Goyal.

She’s grateful that her cancer was caught early, and that she and Newman are both still here. But she grieves all the losses: her breasts, time with her daughter and a sense of normalcy she’ll never entirely get back. “It’s two very diverging feelings,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Parks too understands this dichotomy; after all, her diagnosis was devastating, but it also prompted her daughter to visit an oncologist and schedule an MRI, which detected cancer that likely wouldn’t have been seen on an ultrasound or mammogram until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see it as a blessing, honestly,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Schlossberg, it’s bittersweet that something monstrous had to happen to her mother for something miraculous to happen to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I hate that my mom had to go through this, and I hate that we even see her cancer that way,” she says. “But it really did save my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQanN4V0NBSEhNS3NsSk51UVBzcGgydG5qeHBsZ0wwS2N2clpxQWNuTF84UW9kY0Uwa0RVUTFFNWNwczIxT1FiSmpqV2tPVGtrT1N4SUZpV2xhVVhEM0ZHQ19fVUR2MFNibS0yZVMzbWRZSnVYWmo5RFZBeGFZbGZSY3Y1ZDB4eG9oVGg1ZkFrZlFBeTRfWjJEYw</guid></item><item><title>通过器官移植传播的狂犬病杀死密歇根人- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/rabies-transmitted-through-organ-transplant-kills-michigan-man.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UAO77EDFSZALBORV5CHLUKOW3Q"&gt;A Michigan man contracted rabies from an infected person through an organ transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKTSDVWOXBAALHZ7UL3U7SNQHI"&gt;The man died in February, 51 days after he received a kidney transplant from an infected Idaho man, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm#F1_down" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm#F1_down"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published this month by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X2QZVTPPQZGWLN5BHEBH4GV7GU"&gt;It was the fourth known transplant-transmitted rabies event in the U.S. since 1978. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OJZYEIPLVJELLDERGP4YXFDRPQ"&gt;Rabies is a virus that attacks the central nervous system, almost always resulting in death once it reaches the brain.

Altogether, the data tracked nearly six million years of people’s lives and included more than 43,000 deaths—making this one of the biggest and most detailed studies yet on how personality might relate to lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;Anxiety Tied to Higher Death Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Among the clearest findings was the role of neuroticism, a trait characterized by anxiety, worry and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Adults with higher levels of neuroticism were significantly more likely to die earlier than those with lower levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Researchers found that each one-point increase in neuroticism was associated with a three percent higher risk of death at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The link was especially strong in younger adults, suggesting that long-term stress and difficulty managing emotions can gradually wear down the body and harm health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;Being Organized and Outgoing May Help You Live Longer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;In contrast, people who scored higher on conscientiousness—a tendency to be organized, disciplined and goal-oriented—had a substantially lower risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Each one-point increase in conscientiousness was linked to a 10 percent reduction in mortality risk, the strongest protective effect observed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Extraversion, marked by sociability and engagement with others, was also associated with longer life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Higher extraversion scores were linked to a three percent lower risk of death, particularly in countries such as the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;Not All Traits Matter Equally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The study found little to no consistent association between mortality risk and the traits of openness (curiosity and creativity) or agreeableness (cooperativeness and trust), meaning that not all traits appeared to have a baring on health and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Meanwhile, the study's lead author Máire McGeehan, an assistant professor in &lt;a href="/topic/psychology"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Limerick told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; that the personality linked to higher mortality is not set in stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;"The study looks at how those higher in neuroticism in a general population may be at higher risk of death than someone lower in neuroticism. However, it is important to say that the risk of death is relative, not absolute," McGeehan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;Personality as a Public Health Factor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Paper author and psychologist Páraic S Ó’Súilleabháin, also of Limerick, said that the findings could reshape how researchers and policymakers think about health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Personality is a critical driver of health and longevity. It is important to emphasize that these effects are similar in size to those of commonly considered public health determinants, such as socioeconomic status,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Ó’Súilleabháin described the work as “groundbreaking,” and said that it would drive future research into how psychological traits influence biological processes and health behaviors over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“The information can be useful in creating awareness around choices of health behaviors and coping mechanisms, which may be contributing factors to health outcomes and a longer or shorter life," McGeehan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a science story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailoring breast cancer screening to a woman's individual cancer risk might work better than annual mammograms, a new study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women had &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/what-is-metastatic-breast-cancer-how-is-it-treated-2661662925.html" target="_blank"&gt;breast cancers&lt;/a&gt; caught at an earlier, more treatable stage when assigned to risk-based screening, compared to those who got annual mammograms regardless of personal risk, researchers reported Friday in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842903?utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121225__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!CkCO8l91JplD0jkySDp8Ds_jsi_T7Hp8LakjM2G7eCXXyvjDdvRawDQ9V-Ae1f40JavzXf4P54kcqdj7BV-q12y1pFxFK5Nmvg$" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings should transform clinical guidelines for breast cancer screening and alter clinical practice," &lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/esserman.laura" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Laura Esserman&lt;/a&gt;, director of the University of California-San Francisco Breast Care Center, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers had more than 14,000 women receive breast cancer screening based on their risk, as determined by their age, genetics, lifestyle, health history and breast density:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26% were in the lowest risk category and were generally told not to screen until they reached age 50.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;62% had average risk and were told to screen every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8% had elevated risk and were told to screen annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2% had highest risk and were told to get two screenings a year, alternating between mammograms and MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The personalized approach begins with risk assessment, incorporating genetic, biological and lifestyle factors, which can then guide effective prevention strategies," Esserman explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team compared how these women fared with another group of more than 14,000 who received annual mammograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants were recruited between September 2016 and February 2023, and followed through September 2025, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that fewer women were diagnosed with advanced cancers -- &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/stages-of-breast-cancer-2662746432.html" target="_blank"&gt;stage IIB&lt;/a&gt; or higher -- if they got risk-based screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women with risk-based screening had about 30 cases of advanced cancer per 100,000 person-years, compared with 48 cases per 100,000 person-years for those getting standard mammogram screening. Person-years reflect the amount of time a person has spent in a study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-based screening can also reveal potential perils a woman might not know about, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, 30% of women who tested positive for genetics that increase their breast cancer risk did not report a family history of breast cancer. Under current guidelines, these women would not normally be offered genetic testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the first studies to offer genetic testing to all women, regardless of family history," researcher &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/allison.fiscalini" target="_blank"&gt;Allison Fiscalini&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Athena Breast Health Network at UCSF, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When used as part of a comprehensive risk assessment, these results could have a real impact on improving the safety and effectiveness of screening and prevention," Fiscalini said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now actively enrolling participants for a follow-up clinical trial intended to better identify women at higher risk for more aggressive breast cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the findings, the American College of Radiology said the study does not provide enough evidence to justify changing breast cancer screening guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the women did not stick to the screening pattern recommended to them, the ACR noted, and the study did not turn up enough cancers to fuel the best statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The number of cancers found is small -- likely not representative of the population," the ACR wrote in a statement on the study. "The number of patients in the highest risk group is less than 300."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This can help advance the nutrimetabolomics perspective on how gut metabolites affect cardiovascular and metabolic health,” Routhenstein explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these results indicate a direct link between gut microbial metabolism, immune regulation, and metabolic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They underscore the potential role of nutrition and gut microbes in fighting inflammation and improving metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of TMA’s ability to block this immune pathway reframes the role of the gut microbiome and its influence on immune and metabolic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying TMA’s anti-inflammatory properties &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1125116/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; pave the way for new nutritional or drug-based approaches to prevent or treat insulin resistance and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet remains one of the strongest modulators of gut microbiota composition and function. Previous &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7700621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that dietary plans rich in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146935" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326176" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;whole plant foods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/prebiotics" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; may cultivate a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producing beneficial metabolites, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097825000205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)&lt;/a&gt;, can help regulate glucose metabolism, suppress inflammation, and enhance insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This describes reduced microbial diversity, lower levels of beneficial bacteria, and fewer protective metabolites, which may contribute to diabetes through inflammation and insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may broaden the scope for nutritional interventions, highlighting that it is not just a person’s dietary pattern, but how their gut microbiome metabolizes those nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s lead authors, &lt;a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.dumas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Marc-Emmanuel Dumas&lt;/a&gt;, FRSB, FRSC, Chair in Systems Medicine and Head of the Division of Systems Medicine in the Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction at Imperial College London, noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1108494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This flips the narrative.

He also said it’s a generally good idea to wear a mask when respiratory viruses are going around, but especially if you have symptoms yourself — even if you’re not sure yet whether it’s the flu, a cold, RSV or COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="33rfv"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oh, there’s always the doctor, masks and hand-washing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="90p74"&gt;Camins suggested going to the doctor — ideally, with a mask on — to get diagnosed within 48 hours of getting sick. Those who test positive for the flu can then get a prescription for an antiviral flu medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9uqk4"&gt;He added that over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can also help reduce fever and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d9oet"&gt;Camins acknowledged that staying healthy can be hard if someone else in the household gets sick, especially since those living in cramped NYC apartments may not be able to avoid sharing a bathroom. But Camins said frequent hand-washing — especially if you’re the caretaker — is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOd1FSSDNHLWNXMlNEczZHWmh4Z1lDcnN3ZHlUOENGb0JBVGppbGNadW45LWJIU1lQVlRNZTBlY2I0WGJGZ1pWdUppMEZrNTNoamNGZ2lwYy0weGRwdnBpYmlVT1QybkxTRGdNY1NGZE9DZVFHUVFRQnpmeGJpb2kyQ2lwUkFoRHBZejlydEhiR2VkbTZBU3pCbHNycnVNd1U</guid></item><item><title>为什么切黄油和奶酪对数百万人来说可能毫无意义-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/saturated-fat-butter-cheese-health-b2885607.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gIQPHK sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iBibVd"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 jVZWGn"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eZqxmv"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 tawua"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 gZmYS"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 iCTyfe"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Heavy consumption has traditionally been viewed as one of the leading contributors to poor cardiovascular health, cementing saturated fats as a key target in public health campaigns and nutritional guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging that “a small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet,” the NHS advises that men should not eat more than 30g of saturated fats a day, and women no more than 20g, with the less consumed the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a major meta-analysis of 17 studies, involving a total of 66,337 participants, into how reductions of saturated fats affect health outcomes, found only “high risk” individuals benefitted from reduced consumption of these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For persons at low cardiovascular risk, reducing or modifying saturated fat intake has little or no benefit over a period of 5 years,” the research team, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02229"&gt;&lt;u&gt;writing in medical journal the &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they added: “Among persons at high cardiovascular risk, low- to moderate-certainty evidence was found for important reductions in mortality and major cardiovascular events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an editorial published alongside the research, Dr Ramon Estruch, and Dr Rosa Lamuela-Raventós, both of the University of Barcelona, suggested that the dial of perception on saturated fats has shifted from being wholly negative, to now even having previously under-appreciated health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Times They Are A-Changin,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04971"&gt;&lt;u&gt;they wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, quoting Bob Dylan, before clarifying that they specifically mean regarding the changing debate on consumption of saturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The perception of the health effects of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) has shifted from strictly detrimental to ‘in-between’ effects, to more recently, possibly even protective effects on cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases for some subtypes of SFAs,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that the “diet-heart hypothesis” behind the concerns about saturated fat consumption emerged in the mid-20th century, and rapidly gained traction, “and spread the concept that SFAs cause heart disease by increasing serum cholesterol level”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue the hypothesis is “based on weak evidence of association and not causation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/08/12/46/iStock-1478037416.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/08/12/46/iStock-1478037416.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/08/12/46/iStock-1478037416.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A beautiful slab of cheese – probably ok if taken as part of a balanced diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-163721"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A beautiful slab of cheese – probably ok if taken as part of a balanced diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, maintaining a high intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, along with the consumption of short-, medium-, and very long-chain SFAs, as well as odd-chain SFAs, may confer salutary benefits within the context of an overall healthy and balanced diet,” they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;current NHS advice states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Too much fat in your diet, especially saturated fats, can raise your cholesterol, which increases the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current UK government guidelines advise cutting down on all fats and replacing saturated fat with some unsaturated fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts have sounded a note of caution. Professor Nita Forouhi, a population health and nutrition expert at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the study, said the analysis did not examine health outcomes over ten years – the timeframe typically used in heart-disease risk models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this reason, it would be premature to change existing dietary guidelines recommending saturated fat intake below 10 per cent of total energy intake in the UK,” she told the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The

in Worksop, England, in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The man, who had disabilities, had been referred to the hospital by a primary care physician after contracting a urinary infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite being prescribed intravenous (IV) antibiotics, he ended up waiting 34 hours for the

class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PEOPLE reached out to the Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the Bassetlaw Hospital for comment, but they did not

feeding and personal hygiene,” PHSO continued. “Due to his condition, the man had a permanent catheter and was susceptible to Urinary Tract Infections (UTI).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The man struggled with communicating his needs with medical staff due to his disabilities. While his mother expressed her concerns with the staff at the hospital, she did not realize he had not yet been given the antibiotics prescribed to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The hospital was also told by the paramedics and care home staff that the Nottinghamshire resident needed IV antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though the primary care physician had entered the man’s test results into an online system, the hospital did not use it, due to the request not being in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock image of hospital waiting room&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Instead, following consultation with a microbiologist, staff decided to try an oral antibiotic, but the requested drug was unavailable,” the release read. “At that point, the Ombudsman found that doctors should have requested further advice, and it is likely that IV antibiotics would have been advised and available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The IV antibiotic ended up being given to the man “34 hours after he arrived at [the] hospital, and at half the dosage it should have been," according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There was also a three-hour delay from when the doctors asked for the medication to when it was given to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He had then become septic by the time the second dose was given, before passing away a week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In this case, a man who was unable to advocate [for] himself and completely reliant on clinicians to look after him did not receive the care he needed. Tragically, this meant he unnecessarily lost his life,” Rebecca Hilsenrath KC (Hon), Chief Executive Officer of PHSO, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Losing a life through sepsis should not be an inevitability,” she added. “But we are seeing the same failings repeated time and time again, and complaints about sepsis have more than doubled over the past five years. We also see poor communication between patients and clinicians and we are focusing our efforts to help improve this throughout the NHS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Organizations must be held to account so that justice can be provided, and services can be improved for the future,” Hilsenrath continued. “The NHS needs to have a culture that is open, listens to patients and their families, accepts mistakes when they happen and learns from them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The man’s mother also said, “I knew my son better than anyone, and I was trying to help the doctors by telling them the oral antibiotic wouldn’t work and that the GP had a microbiologist’s report that said he wouldn’t respond to that drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But they just totally dismissed me. Their attitude was they were the doctors, and I was just his mum,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was heartbreaking to finally understand the truth,” the mother continued. “I was given the impression he had at least been given some antibiotics, even if they weren’t the right ones.

"In fact, Christmas Eve is the highest-risk day of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is due to a shift in behavior, specifically drinking and eating too much, moving less and being &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stressed out;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stressed out&lt;/a&gt;, according to London. "Emotional stress, financial stress, the increased pace of the holidays, increased obligations," he listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold weather also causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), according to London, which increases the risk of plaque rupture and the potential for heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/cutting-out-alcohol-medicating-sooner-could-prevent-silent-killer-experts-say" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cutting Out Alcohol And Medicating Sooner Could Prevent 'Silent Killer,' Experts Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cutting Out Alcohol And Medicating Sooner Could Prevent 'Silent Killer,' Experts Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Glenn Hirsch, chief of the division of cardiology at National Jewish Health in New York, noted in an interview with Fox News Digital that holiday heart syndrome typically refers to the onset of an abnormal heart rhythm, or atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can happen after an episode of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:binge-drinking alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;binge-drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, Hirsch said, which can be exacerbated by holiday celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Binge-drinking at any time can drive atrial fibrillation, a cardiologist cautioned.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s often a combination of overdoing the alcohol intake along with high salt intake and large meals that can trigger it," he said. "Adding travel, stress and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and it lowers the threshold to go into that rhythm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk related to atrial fibrillation, according to Hirsch, is stroke and other complications from blood clots. Untreated atrial fibrillation can lead to heart failure after a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/want-better-heart-health-start-tackling-your-weakest-link-cardiac-surgeon-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Want Better Heart Health?

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's so much worse than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For task fMRI, the test-retest reliability is so poor it should probably be considered useless or bordering on pseudoscience, except for in some very limited cases like activation of the visual and/or auditory and/or motor cortex with certain kinds of clear stimuli. For resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), the reliabilities are a bit better, but also still generally extremely poor [1-3].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also two IMO major and devastating theoretical concerns re fMRI that IMO make the whole thing border on nonsense. One is the assumed relation between the BOLD signal and "activation", and two is the extremely horrible temporal resolution of fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is typically assumed that the BOLD response (increased oxygen uptake) (1) corresponds to greater metabolic activity, and (2) increased metabolic activity corresponds to "activation" of those tissues. This trades dubiously on the meaning of "activation", often assuming "activation = excitatory", when we know in fact much metabolic activity is inhibitory. fMRI cannot distinguish between these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other deeper issues, in that it is not even clear to what extent the BOLD signal is from neurons at all (could be glia), and it is possible the BOLD signal must be interpreted differently in different brain regions, and that the usual analyses looking for a "spike" in BOLD activity are basically nonsense, since BOLD activity isn't even related to this at all, but rather the local field potential, instead. All this is reviewed in [4].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re: temporal resolution, essentially, if you pay attention to what is going on in your mind, you know that a LOT of thought can happen in just 0.5 seconds (think of when you have a flash of insight that unifies a bunch of ideas). Or think of how quickly processing must be happening in order for us to process a movie or animation sequence where there are up to e.g. 10 cuts / shots within a single second. There is also just biological evidence that neurons take only milliseconds to spike, and that a sequence of spikes (well under 100ms) can convey meaningful information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the lowest temporal resolutions (repetition times) in fMRI are only around 0.7 seconds. IMO this means that the ONLY way to analyze fMRI that makes sense is to see it as an emergent phenomenon that may be &lt;i&gt;correlated&lt;/i&gt; with certain kinds of long-term activity reflecting cyclical BOLD patterns / low-frequency patterns of the BOLD response. I.e. rs-fMRI is the only fMRI that has ever made much sense a priori. The solution to this is maybe to combine EEG (extremely high temporal resolution, clear use in monitoring realtime brain changes like meditative states and in biofeedback training) with fMRI, as in e.g. [5]. But, it may still well be just the case fMRI remains mostly useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Elliott, M. L., Knodt, A. R., Ireland, D., Morris, M. L., Poulton, R., Ramrakha, S., Sison, M.

Over many decades, some bacteria have gradually become resistant to widely used antibiotics and disinfectants, creating serious challenges for medicine and public health. At the same time, countless bacterial species play a helpful and often critical role in keeping the human body healthy. This raises an important question. Instead of trying to eliminate bacteria, could scientists find ways to influence how they behave to reduce disease and improve health?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are far from silent. Inside the human mouth, roughly 700 different bacterial species constantly exchange information through a process called quorum sensing. This chemical communication allows bacteria to coordinate their actions as a group. Many oral bacteria rely on signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to send and receive these messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating Bacterial Communication in Dental Plaque&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences and the School of Dentistry set out to explore how bacteria in the mouth communicate and whether that communication could be deliberately disrupted. Their goal was to determine if interfering with these signals could help prevent plaque buildup and support a healthier oral microbiome. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Biofilms and Microbiomes&lt;/em&gt;, suggest this approach could reshape how doctors think about treating bacterial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings From the Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered several important patterns in how oral bacteria communicate and organize themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Bacteria in dental plaque generate AHL signals in oxygen-rich areas (such as above the gumline), and those signals can be detected by bacteria living in oxygen-poor regions (beneath the gumline).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Eliminating AHL signals using specialized enzymes called lactonases led to an increase in bacterial species associated with good oral health.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;These results indicate that carefully chosen enzymes might be used to reshape dental plaque communities and help maintain a healthy balance of microbes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dental Plaque as a Living Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dental plaque develops in a sequence, much like a forest ecosystem," said Mikael Elias, associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences and senior author of the study. "Pioneer species like Streptococcus and Actinomyces are the initial settlers in simple communities -- they're generally harmless and associated with good oral health. Increasingly diverse late colonizers include the 'red complex' bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are strongly linked to periodontal disease. By disrupting the chemical signals bacteria use to communicate, one could manipulate the plaque community to remain or return to its health-associated stage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's particularly striking is how oxygen availability changes everything," said lead author Rakesh Sikdar. "When we blocked AHL signaling in aerobic conditions, we saw more health-associated bacteria. But when we added AHLs under anaerobic conditions, we promoted the growth of disease-associated late colonizers. Quorum sensing may play very different roles above and below the gumline, which has major implications for how we approach treatment of periodontal diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward New Microbiome-Based Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to next examine how bacterial signaling differs across various regions of the mouth and among patients at different stages of periodontal disease. "Understanding how bacterial communities communicate and organize themselves may ultimately give us new tools to prevent periodontal disease -- not by waging war on all oral bacteria, but by strategically maintaining a healthy microbial balance," said Elias. The team believes this strategy could eventually lead to therapies for other parts of the body, where imbalances in the microbiome are linked to illness and certain forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;People with prediabetes who get their blood sugar under control may cut their risk of death from heart disease or heart failure by half, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes, which is estimated to affect 38% of U.S. adults, is a condition in which blood sugar levels are elevated but don’t meet the threshold for diabetes. The research, published Friday in the journal Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology, suggested that people with prediabetes whose glucose levels returned to normal — those who reached “remission” — had half the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization from heart failure two decades after reaching remission than those who did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is an incredible finding and really gives people hope that what they do today will have an effect two decades from now,” said Dr. Latha Palaniappan, associate dean for research at Stanford Medicine, who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has long been evidence that Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of heart attacks and heart failure. Some data have shown prediabetes is also associated with cardiovascular disease, but it’s been unclear if that is because it often progresses to diabetes, said Elizabeth Selvin, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may add urgency for patients and doctors to take prediabetes seriously to prevent future complications: Current guidelines for managing prediabetes emphasize weight loss and lifestyle habits to delay or prevent progression to Type 2 diabetes, but they don’t specifically advocate lowering blood glucose levels to a lower-than-prediabetic range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research was a follow-up analysis of data from two landmark trials, including the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program trial, which ran from 1996 to 2001. That trial compared the effects of three interventions on the development of Type 2 diabetes in people who had prediabetes: an intensive lifestyle program including diet and exercise, the use of the blood glucose-lowering drug metformin, and a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial showed that the intensive lifestyle program reduced the development of Type 2 diabetes by 58% in three years compared with the placebo, while metformin reduced it by 31%. (The federal government halted, and then reinstated, funding for the Diabetes Prevention Program this year.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research looked at participants in that trial 20 years later. About 11% of them had dropped to normal glucose levels after one year, regardless of which intervention they got. Twenty years later, this subset had a 50% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease or hospitalization for heart failure than those who had not achieved normal glucose levels, after adjusting for certain characteristics, including whether people developed full-blown diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that finding, the research team conducted a follow-up analysis of a similar diabetes prevention trial in China. In that trial, about 13% of people with elevated glucose achieved normal levels after six years; 30 years later, those people had a 51% lower risk of death from heart disease or hospitalization than those who had not achieved normal levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting that this short-term intervention period has these very long-term effects,” Selvin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normalizing glucose levels — with or without weight loss — can help reduce fat tissue in the abdomen, reduce inflammation and increase insulin sensitivity, said Dr. Andreas Birkenfeld, the chair of the department of diabetology, endocrinology and nephrology at University Hospital Tubingen in Germany, and the senior author of the new paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t know who among the participants made and sustained lifestyle changes after the original intervention period. They tried to control for differences between those who achieved remission and those who didn’t, but some unmeasured difference could be driving different outcomes, said Dr. Jonathan Newman, clinical research director for the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall very few people were able to achieve normal glucose levels in either the U.S. or China trial — a major practical consideration, said Judy Regensteiner, director of the Ludeman Family Center for Women’s Health Research at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. (Regensteiner was an investigator on the Diabetes Prevention Program trial but was not involved in the current study.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good proof of concept,” she said. But, she added, “If these really well-done studies have low success rates in getting people to those numbers, what do we do differently?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts noted that new GLP-1 drugs that help control blood sugar and reduce weight weren’t part of the picture when participants originally enrolled in the diabetes prevention trials in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle interventions are first-line therapy,” Selvin said. “The real open question is, how do we combine these two things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowering blood glucose levels is only one component of reducing cardiovascular disease risk. People still need to maintain a healthy weight, follow a good diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prediabetes is the canary in the coal mine” and often a sign of broader metabolic dysfunction, Newman said. Targeting blood glucose levels alone “is not a slam dunk” in eliminating cardiovascular disease risk, he added, but it can be a useful marker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The morning habit that can spike your cholesterol levels over time is skipping breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It can throw off your circadian rhythm, decrease your diet quality and cause overeating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go for a breakfast high in fiber and protein, move your body and minimize stress daily.   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might think your mornings are healthy—but certain daily rituals could quietly raise your cholesterol over time. We interviewed heart health experts to reveal the surprising morning habit that can affect your heart, plus simple swaps to protect it. Turns out, it’s something about 15% of US adults do on any given day!&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re talking about skipping breakfast. Studies consistently show that skipping breakfast is linked with higher cholesterol levels, even when it leads to modest weight loss.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There are a few reasons for this, which we’re diving into below.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Throws Off Your Circadian Rhythm &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skipping breakfast can throw off your circadian rhythm—your body’s internal clock.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One of the many things that your circadian rhythm controls is lipid metabolism. When your body’s internal clock is thrown off, it may alter some genes and enzymes that regulate your cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Without that morning meal, the liver’s HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which controls the rate of cholesterol production, becomes more active, producing more LDL and total cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast, on the other hand, can help prevent cholesterol spikes that typically happen when you wake up. “Normally, cholesterol synthesis peaks in the early morning, but eating breakfast provides nutrients that help buffer this process,” says Routhenstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Overeat Later &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself mindlessly snacking on high-carb or high-fat foods throughout the day, skipping breakfast may be the underlying cause. “Skipping breakfast can trigger metabolic shifts that increase cholesterol production and may also cause overeating later in the day,” says cardiologist, &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dr. Randy Gould&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is in part because of shifts in hormones that regulate appetite. “Prolonged morning fasting can alter hormones like leptin and ghrelin, increasing hunger and promoting insulin resistance,” says Routhenstein. “This combination can impair your body’s ability to clear cholesterol from the blood, further contributing to higher LDL cholesterol,” she adds. Your body experiences rebound hunger because its nutrient needs were not met earlier in the day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, research results are mixed as to whether skipping breakfast actually leads you to eat more throughout the day. Some studies have found that skipping breakfast leads to a lower overall calorie intake.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, studies consistently find worse cholesterol levels in people who skip breakfast, whether or not they eat more calories throughout the day.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Your Overall Diet Quality May Suffer &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Delaying your first meal of the day may also affect the overall quality of your diet. “Skipping breakfast often leads to larger, less nutrient-dense meals later in the day,” says Routhenstein. These meals may be higher in saturated fat and refined carbs, which “directly contribute to more LDL particle formation and reduce the protective effects of HDL cholesterol,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study found that kids who skip breakfast tend to eat more fat and sodium throughout the day than kids who eat breakfast.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is notable because eating excess saturated fat and sodium can harm heart health. Plus, skipping breakfast may make it harder to eat enough whole grains—sources of high-quality carbs, fiber and minerals—particularly in the U.S. where whole grain cereals are common breakfast foods.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study found that Australian adults who ate a big breakfast consumed more fiber, vitamins and minerals throughout the day than those who skipped it. They also consumed less added sugars, saturated fats and alcohol, which can all negatively affect heart health.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides eating breakfast, there are a few things you can do to transform your morning routine into a tool to lower your cholesterol. The best part? They can be done in a relatively short amount of time! If you currently wake up and rush out the door with no self-care time, focus on adding one thing at a time instead of overhauling your morning routine overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay screen time. &lt;/strong&gt;If you reach for your phone first thing in the morning, try to delay this as much as you can. It may seem unrelated to heart health, but Routhenstein notes how checking messages, notifications or the news can increase stress and start your day on a negative foot. “Taking 10 to 30 minutes screen-free to start your day helps reduce stress, improves mood and allows you to take control of your day and prioritize your health,” says Routhenstein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced breakfast. &lt;/strong&gt;Now you know that eating breakfast is important for heart health, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you eat also matters.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Experts recommend heart-healthy foods rich in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fat. “Starting the day with a balanced breakfast—such as oatmeal, whole grains, lean protein and fresh fruit—helps stabilize energy and avoid the cholesterol-raising effects of sugary cereals and drinks,” says Dr. Gould. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in some movement.&lt;/strong&gt; “A brief period of movement, whether a brisk walk, stretching or light strength training, can improve circulation and support healthy cholesterol levels,” says Dr. Gould. In fact, physical activity is recommended as a first-line approach to managing high cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So go for a morning stroll, hit the gym or get in a quick stretch when you wake up. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take time to destress.&lt;/strong&gt; Diet and exercise aren’t the only things that influence heart health—stress also plays a big role. “Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can raise cholesterol production, and it may also lead to unhealthy coping habits like overeating,” says Dr. Gould. Especially if you live a high-stress lifestyle, take a few minutes (or more!) in the morning to destress, whether through movement, breathwork, journaling or anything else that works for you! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As tempting as it may be to rush out the door without eating a balanced breakfast, this habit could silently raise your cholesterol. Heart health experts recommend eating a high-fiber, high-protein morning meal that’s low in added sugars and saturated fat. This helps stabilize your energy levels, buffer the liver’s production of cholesterol and prevent overeating later in the day. In addition to eating a nutritious breakfast, try to take time to move and destress at the start of your day instead of checking your phone to prevent cholesterol-raising cortisol spikes.

			&lt;p&gt;Tiny biological batteries &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-cells-powerhouses-are-secretly-helping-fight-bacteria-study-finds"&gt;known as mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; keep the body's cells running smoothly, and their gradual decline is linked to a wide range of age-related diseases. Now scientists think they have found a way to keep mitochondria powered for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX7A2L"&gt;COX7RP&lt;/a&gt; is key to this discovery from researchers at the Saitama Medical University and Chiba University in Japan. The protein is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12124-6"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; to help mitochondria form &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomplex"&gt;supercomplexes&lt;/a&gt;, structures that improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, male mice engineered to produce extra COX7RP showed a host of differences compared with controls, including a 6.6 percent increase in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;average lifespan&lt;/a&gt; and indicators of an extended healthspan – being able to live healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mitochondria-dump-their-rubbish-dna-and-it-could-be-costing-us-our-health"&gt;Mitochondria Dump Their Rubbish DNA, And It Could Be Costing Us Our Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We previously identified COX7RP, a mitochondrial protein, as a key factor that promotes the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby enhancing energy production and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress in cells," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016907/index.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; gerontologist Satoshi Inoue, from Saitama Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on this, we investigated the role of COX7RP and mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in regulating aging and anti-aging processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185334" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/LifespanChart.jpg" alt="Mice lifespan" class="wp-image-185334 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/LifespanChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/LifespanChart-600x297.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185334" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Genetically engineered mice were shown to live longer. (Ikeda et al., &lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The improved healthspan indicators observed in the COX7RP-boosted mice included better glucose handling, lower levels of fatty acids in the blood, and increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;muscle endurance&lt;/a&gt;, which can all help maintain functional bodies into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of mouse tissue samples confirmed that the mitochondria in the COX7RP-boosted mice were operating more efficiently – linked to more supercomplexes – and producing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-your-body-turn-food-into-fuel-scientists-tracked-individual-atoms-to-find-out"&gt;more fuel for the body&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key molecular biomarkers related to aging showed improvements, too. While we already knew COX7RP was helpful to mitochondria, the study provides new insight into the difference it can potentially make to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;health and aging&lt;/a&gt; – and how these cell power generators could be influencing lifespan directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While many studies have reported shortened lifespans in disease models and interventions to overcome them, evidence for lifespan or healthspan extension under non-disease conditions remains limited," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.70294"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Healthspan' refers to years of living independently, staying free from disease, and retaining good physical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;and mental health&lt;/a&gt; into old age. As the world's population gets older, these considerations are increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's becoming apparent that mitochondria play a central role in this process. Previous studies have linked problems with the cell power stations &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reverse-dementia-like-memory-loss-in-mice-by-supercharging-brain-cells"&gt;to dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and we also know health conditions like obesity &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/obesity-disrupts-mitochondria-and-we-may-have-figured-out-how"&gt;can disrupt mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this still needs to be confirmed in humans of course, but there could be some big clues here to support our chances of a healthy old age. The researchers suggest their findings could eventually lead to treatments for age-related diseases, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="185331" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"&gt;dyslipidemia&lt;/a&gt;, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study elucidated novel mitochondrial mechanisms underlying anti-aging and longevity, and provided new insights into strategies for promoting healthspan and extending lifespan," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016907/index.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Inoue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For instance, supplements and medications that enhance the assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes may contribute to longevity expansion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.70294"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that psychological well-being acts as a precursor to self-control rather than a result of it. This research indicates that individuals who prioritize their emotional health may be better equipped to pursue long-term goals than those who rely solely on willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychology has traditionally viewed self-control as a prized human capacity that is essential for a successful life. The general assumption holds that the ability to resist short-term temptations in favor of long-term goals leads to better health, career success, and financial security. By extension, scholars and the public alike often assume that exercising high self-control leads to increased happiness and life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of this belief, the scientific evidence supporting a direct causal link from self-control to well-being has been inconclusive. Many previous studies relied on correlational data, which can show that two things are related but cannot determine which one causes the other. Other studies that attempted to track these variables over time faced methodological issues that made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about directionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work was driven by a significant gap in the existing research. For years, psychologists have operated under the strong assumption that self-control is a key driver of well-being,” said study author &lt;a href="https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/people/jia-lile/" target="_blank"&gt;Lile Jia&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore and director of &lt;a href="https://www.situatedgoalpursuit.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Situated Goal Pursuit (SPUR) Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The narrative is that if you are more disciplined, you will be happier and more satisfied with life. However, when we examined the scientific literature, the causal evidence for this claim was surprisingly weak and fraught with issues. Most studies were correlational, and the few longitudinal studies attempting to establish causality had methodological limitations that made their conclusions ambiguous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, there are strong theoretical reasons to suspect the causal arrow might point in the opposite direction,” Jia explained. “For example, Barbara Fredrickson’s ‘broaden-and-build’ theory suggests that positive emotions—a core component of well-being—broaden our mindset and help us build personal resources. We reasoned that these resources could, in turn, facilitate better self-control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the central motivation was to rigorously test these competing causal pathways. We wanted to clarify the directionality of this important relationship between self-control and well-being using more robust statistical methods (the RI-CLPM) and a three-wave longitudinal design, which is better suited for making causal inferences than the two-wave designs used in prior work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two separate longitudinal studies. Study 1 involved 377 working adults recruited from an Asian country. The participants were part of a larger project regarding career development and lifelong learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected data from these participants at three distinct time points, with each wave separated by a six-month interval. This design allowed the team to track changes within the same individuals over a period of one year. To measure self-control, the participants completed a 20-item scale that assessed their ability to inhibit impulses, initiate work, and continue good behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the assessment of well-being, the participants responded to a scale designed to be culturally appropriate for the population. This measure included items asking about their levels of happiness, self-worth, and appreciation for life. The team also utilized a statistical technique known as the random intercept cross-lagged panel model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This specific analytical approach is significant because it separates stable personality traits from temporary fluctuations within a person. It allowed the researchers to determine if a specific increase in well-being at one time point predicted a subsequent increase in self-control at the next time point. By isolating these within-person changes, the model provides a stronger test for potential causal influence than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the first study revealed a pattern that contradicted the traditional narrative. Earlier levels of self-control did not reliably predict improvements in well-being six months later. Simply exercising discipline did not appear to make participants happier in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the data supported the reverse hypothesis. Participants who reported higher levels of well-being at one time point exhibited greater self-control at the next measurement wave. Feeling well appeared to function as a precursor to functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure these findings were not specific to one culture or time interval, the researchers conducted a second study. Study 2 recruited a larger sample of 1,299 working adults in the United States. This study followed a similar three-wave design but utilized a shorter time frame to capture more immediate effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the American sample completed surveys once a month for three consecutive months. They answered the same self-control questions used in the first study. To measure well-being, they completed a scale assessing positive feelings, optimism, and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the American data yielded results that mirrored those of the Asian sample. High levels of self-control at the start of a month did not lead to increased well-being the following month. The anticipated reward of happiness following disciplined behavior did not materialize in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the reverse relationship remained significant and positive. Individuals who felt more optimistic and energetic at the beginning of the month demonstrated better self-control a month later. This replication across two different cultures and timeframes provides robust evidence that the primary direction of influence flows from well-being to self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most surprising result was the consistent lack of evidence for the popular belief that self-control predicts later well-being,” Jia told PsyPost. “Given how deeply this idea is embedded in both scientific thinking and popular culture, we expected to see at least a small effect in that direction. To find that the data from two separate studies so clearly supported only the path from well-being to self-control was quite striking. It really challenges a foundational assumption and underscores the need to re-evaluate how we think about these two critical aspects of a good life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted supplementary analyses to further check these patterns. In the first study, participants also provided daily reports of their mood and behavior for a week. These daily records showed that while positive emotions predicted self-control months later, self-control did not uniquely predict daily positive emotions when general well-being was taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that positive emotions may help replenish the mental energy required to resist temptations and stick to difficult tasks. When people feel good, they may be more open to challenges and better at managing conflicting goals. This aligns with the idea that well-being acts as fuel for the engine of self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important takeaway for the average person is to reconsider how they approach self-improvement,” Jia said. “The common advice is often to ‘just try harder’ or to focus on building discipline through sheer willpower. Our findings suggest a potentially more effective, and certainly more pleasant, alternative: &lt;em&gt;prioritize your well-being to build your self-control&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of viewing happiness as a reward you get after achieving your goals through discipline, think of well-being as the fuel that powers the engine of self-control. If you want to get better at resisting temptations, starting new projects, or sticking with good habits, a great first step is to invest in activities that make you feel happy, energetic, optimistic, and appreciative of life. Our research indicates that feeling well precedes functioning well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s strength lies in its use of a three-wave longitudinal design across two diverse cultural samples. But as with all research, there are some limitations. The statistical framework used relies on the assumption that the relationships between variables remain constant over time. It is also possible that unmeasured third variables, such as changes in sleep, stress, or social support, could influence both well-being and self-control simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the absence of a short-term effect does not mean self-control has no relationship with happiness. “A crucial caveat is that ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,'” Jia explained. “Our study failed to find a within-person causal effect of self-control on well-being, but this does not mean that self-control is unimportant for happiness altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that having high self-control as a stable, long-term trait contributes to a person’s overall life satisfaction (a between-persons effect), even if short-term fluctuations in self-control don’t cause short-term fluctuations in well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the misinterpretation to avoid is thinking ‘self-control doesn’t matter for happiness.’ A more accurate interpretation is that if you are looking for a positive change, our evidence suggests that boosting your well-being is a more direct and effective way to improve your self-control, rather than the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore the specific mechanisms that allow well-being to improve self-control. It may be that positive moods accelerate habit formation or enhance cognitive flexibility. Understanding these processes could lead to better interventions for people struggling with self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The path to greater self-control doesn’t have to be a grim, effortful struggle,” Jia added. “Instead, it can be paved with positive experiences. By actively cultivating joy, engagement, and meaning in our lives, we are not just making ourselves feel better in the moment; we are also building the psychological resources we need to be more effective and successful in the future. It places the pursuit of well-being at the very center of personal growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506251385007" target="_blank"&gt;Feeling Well, Functioning Well: How Psychological Well-Being Predicts Later Self-Control, but Not the Other Way Around&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Shuna Shiann Khoo, Lile Jia, Ismaharif Ismail, Ying Li, Liangyu Xing, and Jolynn Pek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 11:04:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOWW96b2h5d1MwVjExeTJCdW1QRkVNc2xHSlFXSGpqblpVS0Ribm1ibXctdVRiZWtuZDBuM1NaMl81YW02XzE0bGJ6S3FxbUVoRHdIOWYtcXFpR3A4RXJkMHBlMFpGQVBCWTZqZjJSa1VOc3VBSlZ1cTVTSnFyUkNpbktTOURMMWZvcGM3dGloZTFZaTc2eFR0ZHl2OA</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州麻疹应对措施将个人选择置于订单之上- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/16/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-response</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:32:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBwaTFOMmt3a3RYVlZBR2lsbzdHcGQyVmQ4YkdiRHpITDBmRmFpVzV4dXd0VkhzWkpoR1pOaFFHSFUwbmNsYThKVzNtRFJyTEZFOWI2ajhkUmh2a2NuOUV6Zzh6UGhKbGgtYUdPSHJyVVNSQTFJRHRucGNwS3ZUQQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现基因与疾病之间缺失的联系- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251215084201.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Biomedical scientists are racing to identify the genes that contribute to illness, hoping that these discoveries will lead to treatments that target the right genes and help bring the body back to health.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one faulty gene is responsible, the path to understanding the problem can be fairly direct. Many conditions, however, are far more complicated. In these cases, multiple genes, sometimes even thousands, play a role, and it becomes much harder to sort out how they connect to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new genomic mapping approach could make that challenge easier to tackle. In a &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study, researchers at Gladstone Institutes and Stanford University used a broad strategy that tests the impact of every gene in a cell, linking diseases and other traits to the underlying genetic systems that shape them. The resulting maps could cut through confusing biology and spotlight the genes most likely to be useful targets for new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can now look across every gene in the genome and get a sense of how each one affects a particular cell type," says Gladstone Senior Investigator Alex Marson, MD, PhD, the Connie and Bob Lurie Director of the Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, who co-led the study. "Our goal is to use this information as a map to gain new insights into how certain genes influence specific traits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the 'Why' Behind Genetic Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have relied heavily on "genome-wide association studies," which scan the DNA of thousands of people to find statistical links between genetic differences and traits, including disease risk. These efforts have generated enormous datasets, but turning those signals into clear biological explanations can be difficult, especially for traits influenced by many genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even with these studies, there remains a huge gap in understanding disease biology on a genetic level," says first author Mineto Ota, MD, PhD. Ota is a postdoctoral scholar in Marson's Gladstone lab, as well as in the lab of Stanford scientist Jonathan Pritchard, PhD. "We understand that many variants are associated with disease; we just don't understand why."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mineto compares it to having a map with a clear starting point and endpoint, but no routes connecting the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To understand complex traits, we really need to focus on the network," says Pritchard, a professor of Biology and Genetics at Stanford, who co-led the study with Marson. "How do we think about biology when thousands and thousands of genes, with many different functions, are all affecting a trait?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining Cell Experiments With Big Population Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dig into that network problem, the researchers pulled information from two databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One dataset came from a human leukemia cell line that is commonly used to study red blood cell traits. In earlier work, an MIT researcher who was not involved in this study had switched off each gene in that cell line, one at a time, and tracked how losing that gene changed genetic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marson's team then paired those results with UK Biobank data, which includes genomic sequences from more than 500,000 people. Ota searched for individuals with genetic mutations that lowered gene function in ways that changed their red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the two sources together allowed the researchers to build a detailed map of the gene networks that influence red blood cell traits. The picture that emerged showed a remarkably complex genetic landscape. With this approach, they could see the starting point, the destination, and the intricate set of connections in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also discovered that some genes affect several biological processes at the same time, weakening certain activities while increasing others. One example is SUPT5H, a gene associated with beta thalassemia, a blood disorder that disrupts hemoglobin production and can lead to moderate to severe anemia. The researchers connected SUPT5H to three key blood cell programs: hemoglobin production, cell cycle, and autophagy. They also showed how the gene influences each program, either increasing or reducing gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SUPT5H regulates all three main pathways that affect hemoglobin," Pritchard says. "It activates hemoglobin synthesis, slows down the cell cycle, and slows down autophagy, which together have a synergistic effect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Mapping Method Could Matter for Immunology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to reveal the detailed genetic pathways that control how cells function could reshape both basic biology and drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the team identified multiple ways gene networks shape blood cell behavior, the bigger story is the tool itself. The research group, and potentially many other scientists, can now apply the same strategy to other human cell types to uncover the molecular patterns that drive disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Marson lab, which focuses on T cells and other parts of the immune system, the method could open the door to many more discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The genetic burden associated with many autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and allergies are overwhelmingly linked to T cells," Marson says. "We look forward to developing additional detailed maps that will help us really understand the genetic architecture behind these immune-mediated diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "Causal modeling of gene effects from regulators to programs to traits," appears in the December 10, 2025 issue of Nature.

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing an increase in (Emergency Medical Serv­ices) calls and responses to 911 for respiratory-related and flu-like symptoms, which then is resulting in more transports to emergency centers across the state,” said Garrett Hall, the department’s acting state EMS Chief, in a video statement. “Any time we see an increase in EMS transport, it directly correlates to an increase in patient volume to emergency departments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seasonal uptick in flu-related symptoms is expected during the winter months, especially as more gatherings take place indoors. There has, however, been a sharp increase in respiratory-related 911 calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Hall, responders recorded 352 respiratory-related encounters for the week ending Nov. 20; 344 on the week ending Nov. 27, or Thanksgiving Day; and 332 transports for the week ending Dec. 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents about 45% more than total EMS respiratory-related encounters during the summer, in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated for respiratory illnesses, if they have not done so yet, as well as to stay home while sick to help prevent the spread of viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hall, approximately 83% of EMS respiratory encounters result in transport, and an estimated 40% to 50% require admission to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent uptick puts a strain not only on the 911 system, but on hospital beds and the state’s overall capacity to handle health care emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We always need to be aware of this and monitor it diligently,” said Hall, who is with the EMS and Injury Prevention Systems Branch, “in case there is a disaster or significant event which would require more resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, seasonal influenza is also on the rise, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A new flu strain — influenza A (H3N2) subclade K — is contributing to a surge across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strain likely spurred a record number of flu cases in Australia, extending the influenza season there as well as in New Zealand, according to Eurosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH recommends taking protective steps, such as getting help early from doctors or an urgent care center if experiencing mild to moderate flu symptoms rather than emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are asking the public to take simple steps now to protect themselves and to help preserve access to emergency care for those who need it most,” said Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-test kits available at pharmacies can help determine whether an illness is the flu, COVID-19 or other respiratory virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOH &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease-types/respiratory-viruses/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;respiratory dashboard&lt;/a&gt; shows high positivity rates for influenza, along with rising emergency department visits for respiratory syncytial virus, which can cause more severe symptoms in infants and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positivity rate for COVID-19 in Hawaii, on the other hand, is currently low, with a positivity rate of just 0.8% as of Dec. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials remind the public that flu, RSV and COVID vaccines remain the best protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death — and help reduce spread in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH as part of the West Coast Health Alliance has issued its &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/09/18/hawaii-news/hawaii-health-officials-issue-own-vaccine-recommendations/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;own recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the vaccines this respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone six months and older. RSV immunizations are available for infants and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Hall said, it is important to stay home when sick and to avoid school, work, or gatherings with symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat or other respiratory symptoms. Washing hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes are also helpful, as is masking in crowded, indoor settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keiki, kupuna, and individuals with chronic diseases can be at high risk, especially, during the flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get vaccinated and don’t delay, if you’re feeling sick or ill, in getting treatment,” said Hall. “Get tested. Reach out to your primary care provider or an urgent care if you’re suspecting it. Get treatment early, and don’t wait until you can’t breathe or you need to call 911.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are experiencing severe or worsening symptoms or difficulty breathing, however, should seek emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Honolulu Star-Advertiser</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:06:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPdXdpS1gyX3ZYcVNwYjRRM3otTFlpcUxRUWV4UkxmcG5yY09wa0lKZFAyWWVFYm1NM3dPX2p4MEU1SVAwVFoxS1BXR3YwSFdDYnNZeUZwMk9wMXV0cVJkM3dHZzRzNWg3N1BSTHlzYkZkdTdkcEdkU0hZYUd3cV9sMzNMQVhPOGowSlE4VVRTcnQxRmVuRXF6bGduYm5ZMjEySW1XbnVPNlpNTXVRN1NXeg</guid></item><item><title>牙龈疾病可能与动脉斑块积聚有关，主要心血管疾病事件的风险更高- www.heart.org</title><link>https://newsroom.heart.org/news/gum-disease-may-be-linked-to-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-higher-risk-of-major-cvd-events</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="body-container" class="cBuilder article-body"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DALLAS, Dec. 16, 2025 — There is increasing evidence that gum disease is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, including &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack" target="_blank"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke" target="_blank"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation" target="_blank"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure" target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and cardiometabolic health conditions. Effective prevention and treatment of gum disease, also called periodontal disease, could potentially decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease, according to a new scientific statement published today in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal &lt;strong&gt;Circulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new American Heart Association scientific statement, “Periodontal Disease and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,” features new data supporting an association between periodontal disease and &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/ascvd" target="_blank"&gt;atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (ASCVD) and updates the Association’s 2012 scientific statement. ACSVD, the leading cause of death globally, is caused by buildup of arterial plaque (fatty deposits in the arteries) and refers to conditions that include coronary heart disease, stroke, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/peripheral-artery-disease" target="_blank"&gt;peripheral artery disease&lt;/a&gt; and aortic aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your mouth and your heart are connected,” said Chair of the scientific statement writing group Andrew H. Tran, M.D., M.P.H., M.S., FAHA, a pediatric cardiologist and the director of the preventive cardiology program at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. “Gum disease and poor oral hygiene can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, causing inflammation that may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease. Brushing, flossing and regular dental checkups aren’t just about a healthy smile—they’re an important part of protecting your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights of the statement include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting over 40% of U.S. adults over age 30. The earliest stage is gingivitis (inflammation of the gums due to buildup of oral plaque). If left untreated, gingivitis may progress to periodontitis, where the gums begin to pull away from the teeth, forming small pockets that can trap bacteria and lead to infection. The most advanced stage, severe periodontitis, involves extensive damage to the bones supporting the teeth; teeth may become loose and fall out. This stage often requires surgical intervention. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Periodontal disease is more common in individuals with poor oral hygiene and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, overweight or obesity, diabetes and smoking. The prevalence of periodontal disease is also higher among men, older adults, individuals with low physical activity and people affected by adverse social determinants of health, such as lower socioeconomic status, food insecurity and/or lack of access to health care including dental care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Although periodontal disease and ASCVD share common risk factors, emerging data indicates there is an independent association between the two conditions. Potential biological mechanisms linking periodontal disease with poor cardiovascular outcomes include direct pathways such as bacteria in the blood and vascular infections, as well as indirect pathways such as chronic systemic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Numerous studies have found that periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiac death. Although periodontal disease clearly contributes to chronic inflammation that is associated with ASCVD, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is also no direct evidence that periodontal treatment will help prevent cardiovascular disease. However, treatments that reduce the lifetime exposure to inflammation appear to be beneficial to reducing the risk of developing ASCVD. The treatment and control of periodontal disease and associated inflammation may contribute to the prevention and improved management of ASCVD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People with one or more cardiovascular disease risk factors are considered to be at higher risk and may benefit from regular dental screenings and targeted periodontal care to address chronic inflammation. Previous studies have found that more frequent tooth brushing is associated with lower 10-year ASCVD risk (13.7% for once-daily or less brushing vs. 7.35% for brushing three or more times per day) and reduced inflammatory markers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;More research, including long-term studies and randomized controlled trials, is needed to determine whether periodontal treatment can impact ASCVD progression and outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In addition, the role of socioeconomic status, access to dental care and other social factors that adversely affect health should be explored to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies that can help reduce the prevalence and adverse outcomes of periodontal disease and ASCVD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and Stanford University have developed a new way to stimulate the immune system to attack tumor cells, using a strategy that could make cancer immunotherapy work for many more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to their approach is reversing a “brake” that cancer cells engage to prevent immune cells from launching an attack. This brake is controlled by sugar molecules known as glycans that are found on the surface of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By blocking those glycans with molecules called lectins, the researchers showed they could dramatically boost the immune system’s response to cancer cells. To achieve this, they created multifunctional molecules known as AbLecs, which combine a lectin with a tumor-targeting antibody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Animation shows, over 5 hours, red dots indicating killed cancer cells." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="06589a00-66d8-4483-a296-4f155ef4488d" src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-antibody-lectin-02-press.gif" loading="lazy"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;This animation of AbLec-treated macrophages and cancer cells show how cancer cell killing happens over a period of 5 hours. The red fluorescence indicates cancer cells that have been killed by the macrophages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Image: Courtesy of the researchers&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We created a new kind of protein therapeutic that can block glycan-based immune checkpoints and boost anti-cancer immune responses,” says Jessica Stark, the Underwood-Prescott Career Development Professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and Chemical Engineering. “Because glycans are known to restrain the immune response to cancer in multiple tumor types, we suspect our molecules could offer new and potentially more effective treatment options for many cancer patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stark, who is also a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, is the lead author of the paper. Carolyn Bertozzi, a professor of chemistry at Stanford and director of the Sarafan ChEM Institute, is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02884-6" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Releasing the brakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells is a promising approach to treating many types of cancer. One class of immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors stimulate immune cells by blocking an interaction between the proteins PD-1 and PD-L1. This removes a brake that tumor cells use to prevent immune cells like T cells from killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs targeting the PD-1- PD-L1 checkpoint have been approved to treat several kinds of cancer. In some of these patients, checkpoint inhibitors can lead to long-lasting remission, but for many others, they don’t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of generating immune responses in a greater number of patients, researchers are now working on ways to target other immunosuppressive interactions between cancer cells and immune cells. One such interaction occurs between glycans on tumor cells and receptors found on immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycans are found on nearly all living cells, but tumor cells often express glycans that are not found on healthy cells, including glycans that contain a monosaccharide called sialic acid. When sialic acids bind to lectin receptors, located on immune cells, it turns on an immunosuppressive pathway in the immune cells. These lectins that bind to sialic acid are known as Siglecs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When Siglecs on immune cells bind to sialic acids on cancer cells, it puts the brakes on the immune response. It prevents that immune cell from becoming activated to attack and destroy the cancer cell, just like what happens when PD-1 binds to PD-L1,” Stark says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there aren’t any approved therapies that target this Siglec-sialic acid interaction, despite a number of drug development approaches that have been tried. For example, researchers have tried to develop lectins that could bind to sialic acids and prevent them from interacting with immune cells, but so far, this approach hasn’t worked well because lectins don’t bind strongly enough to accumulate on the cancer cell surface in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome that, Stark and her colleagues developed a way to deliver larger quantities of lectins by attaching them to antibodies that target cancer cells. Once there, the lectins can bind to sialic acid, preventing sialic acid from interacting with Siglec receptors on immune cells. This lifts the brakes off the immune response, allowing immune cells such as macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to launch an attack on the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This lectin binding domain typically has relatively low affinity, so you can’t use it by itself as a therapeutic. But, when the lectin domain is linked to a high-affinity antibody, you can get it to the cancer cell surface where it can bind and block sialic acids,” Stark says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modular system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers designed an AbLec based on the antibody trastuzumab, which binds to HER2 and is approved as a cancer therapy to treat breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers. To form the AbLec, they replaced one arm of the antibody with a lectin, either Siglec-7 or Siglec-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests using cells grown in the lab showed that this AbLec rewired immune cells to attack and destroy cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested their AbLecs in a mouse model that was engineered to express human Siglec receptors and antibody receptors. These mice were then injected with cancer cells that formed metastases in the lungs. When treated with the AbLec, these mice showed fewer lung metastases than mice treated with trastuzumab alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that they could swap in other tumor-specific antibodies, such as rituximab, which targets CD20, or cetuximab, which targets EGFR. They could also swap in lectins that target other glycans involved in immunosuppression, or antibodies that target checkpoint proteins such as PD-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AbLecs are really plug-and-play. They’re modular,” Stark says. “You can imagine swapping out different decoy receptor domains to target different members of the lectin receptor family, and you can also swap out the antibody arm. This is important because different cancer types express different antigens, which you can address by changing the antibody target.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stark, Bertozzi, and others have started a company called Valora Therapeutics, which is now working on developing lead AbLec candidates. They hope to begin clinical trials in the next two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface, a Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Steven A. Rosenberg Scholar Award, a V Foundation V Scholar Grant, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a Merck Discovery Biologics SEEDS grant, an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship, and a Sarafan ChEM-H Postdocs at the Interface seed grant.&lt;/p&gt;
