&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0mizw000v26m57jmugf5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Depression is becoming more common among adults and adolescents in the United States, but most are not getting therapy to help, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00043b6o2k64woud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1 in 8 people ages 12 and up in the US have been depressed in recent years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db527.htm" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Depression prevalence has nearly doubled, from 7.3% in 2015-16 to more than 13% in 2021-23.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00053b6opelhwd1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are based on results from a federal survey – most recently conducted between August 2021 and August 2023 – in which participants reported whether they had had certain symptoms associated with depression in the previous two weeks. Responses to these validated screening questions were scored to determine whether the individuals had depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j8yam000023b6o9uws7jui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the administration of the survey, and modifications that were made once it resumed – including changes to the way it was administered – may have affected the ability to most accurately track changes over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j8zmw100063b6o64q26p42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are less likely to report conditions that could potentially be considered socially undesirable in face-to-face interviews than they are in phone or online interviews, and changes in that method could account for increases, Dr. Renee Goodwin, a psychiatric epidemiologist and clinical psychologist with Columbia University, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00063b6o1xwvlt44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, experts have long said that the pandemic&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;exacerbated mental health challenges for many in the US – 90% of adults have said that the country is facing a mental health crisis, according to a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from CNN in partnership with KFF – but experts have also said that awareness around mental health has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j92kmc000a3b6o51ex0ao6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Matt Mishkind, deputy director of the Johnson Depression Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, says that researchers have been trying to figure out why depression rates have been growing for the past decade or so – and at least part of it has to do with decreasing stigma around talking about mental health in some groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j99w2j000f3b6ohslbxr84@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The question then is, has that truly increased, or have we just been able to identify it more? I definitely think it has increased, and I think that’s because I think the world is a difficult place right now,” he said. “I think there’s been stressor after stressor after stressor for a long time now, and I think that is starting to truly affect people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00073b6ozkfwe6gf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC data, women are more likely than men to have depression, and prevalence tends to decrease with age and greater wealth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00083b6otfkmkcsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, about 16% of women and 10% of men had depression during the 2021-23 survey period. But more than 1 in 4 adolescent girls between ages 12 and 19 had depression, the data shows, higher than any other demographic group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00093b6ope79rkny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the CDC’s latest Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that more than half of high school girls (53%) said they felt persistently sad or hopeless – nearly twice the rate of share of boys (28%) who said the same and 14 percentage points higher than a decade earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000a3b6o5wyxcy7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Girls are more verbal and vocal about some of their challenges, traditionally; boys are not as much, although I think that is changing,” Dr. Jill Emanuele, vice president of clinical training at the Child Mind Institute in New York City, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/health/teen-mental-health-cdc-wellness/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; in August. She was not involved in any of the CDC reports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000b3b6outqis0ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of adults and adolescents with depression in the latest survey – nearly 88% – said that symptoms had created difficulties for them in work, at home or with social activities, and about a third of those said it was “very to extremely difficult.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000c3b6ozezzfg8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But only about 40% of adults and adolescents with depression received counseling or therapy, the new CDC report shows. Women were more likely than men to have received therapy: about 43%, compared with 33%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000d3b6okyl8824u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adult women are also more than twice as likely as adult men to take medication for depression, according to another CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db528.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday. In 2023, about 11.4% of US adults took a prescription medication for depression – but that breaks out to more than 15% of women and 7.4% of men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000e3b6olhfsv6qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite higher rates of depression in younger age groups, the new CDC reports show that middle-age people were more likely than younger adults to take prescription medication for depression. More than 12% of adults between ages 45 and 74 did so in 2023, compared with less than 11% of adults ages 18 to 44.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000f3b6o9x0fbnvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has specifically targeted a certain class of antidepressant drugs in recent comments. At his Senate confirmation this year, he &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/health/rfk-jr-antidepressants-addictive-wellness/index.html"&gt;falsely suggested&lt;/a&gt; that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, may be more addictive than heroin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000g3b6o8cl3kztu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for the Make America Healthy Again commission – which Kennedy will lead – specifically plans to address an assessment of the “prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors” for children, along with other mental health medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000h3b6o7num9g5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in February, health care data and analytics company Truveta analyzed information from its database of millions of electronic health records to understand whether increased awareness around mental health has led to increases in people seeking medication or concerns around overprescribing or dependency on antidepressant medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000i3b6oqeieg8rz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It found that trends in &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/mental-health-prescribing-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;prescriptions for mental health&lt;/a&gt; have remained relatively stable since 2018. Rates ticked up in the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic but have since dropped to levels from 2018 or lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000j3b6ogq92xjtn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed mental health medication – with SSRIs accounting for nearly half – but Truveta found trends in prescribing rates to be much steadier than the CDC found in trends for depression prevalence. And the findings do not suggest that over-rescribing mental health medications should be a concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000k3b6oclz8jsl8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While increased mental health awareness and the heightened demand for care during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to shifts in prescribing rates, our findings suggest that overall trends in mental health prescriptions have remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations in recent years,” Truveta researchers wrote in a blog post.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000l3b6orszvh5yi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While there was a slight increase in the rate of mental health prescriptions during the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent stabilization and decrease suggests that the rise was likely a temporary response to heightened mental health needs rather than a long-term shift toward higher prescribing rates.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — A new report from Harris County Health shows cases of &lt;a href="/article/news/health/breakthrough-hiv-prevention-join-the-discussion-on-prep-on-khou-11/285-321bdc5f-8385-4cc0-97ff-62da54c59090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and other sexually transmitted infections are rising throughout the &lt;a href="/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Houston area at a faster rate&lt;/a&gt; than any other place in Texas. The rates of new infections are even rising among diseases you may have forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia all of them," says Legacy Health's director of health navigation, Jill Jahns. "It's a big issue we have here in our community. Harris County and Houston in particular have been surpassing the rates of STIs in Texas."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lag for required reporting, the most recent data in the report covers the time period between 2016 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Between 2016 and 2022, the rates of syphilis in our community doubled," Jahns says. "Which is definitely concerning."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report includes a map of the zip codes where the rate of syphilis is the highest. The parts of the Houston area with the highest rates are: Downtown, Montrose and the OST area, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For chlamydia, the highest rates of new cases are located in the Medical Center area, La Porte and Downtown.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ages we're seeing it the highest is ages 15 through 24," Jahns said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows gonorrhea has an infection rate that is surging in the Medical Center area, followed by Downtown and then Sunnyside.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest rates of new HIV cases were seen in Montrose, followed by the Second Ward and then Settegast.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the sexually transmitted infections are found in basically every demographic in Harris County, the study found there is one population that is testing positive for them at a faster rate than others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Particularly Black women," Jahns said. "Black women who are heterosexual are frequently getting STIs at a higher rate than other groups."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start is from a position of knowledge. &lt;a href="https://www.legacycommunityhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Legacy Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free and confidential HIV and STI testing and some results are returned in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Houston's most prevalent STIs can be treated with medication, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/breakthrough-hiv-prevention-join-the-discussion-on-prep-on-khou-11/285-321bdc5f-8385-4cc0-97ff-62da54c59090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;including HIV, which no longer has to deliver a death sentence&lt;/a&gt;. Houston's HIV positive patients are given medication at Legacy Health to not only survive but also drugs that keep the active virus in their bodies low enough, to protect somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

From bone pain to medical conditions, low vitamin D is a problem worth tending to ASAP. The good news? There are a few easy ways to keep those levels in check. Below, the experts break down everything you need to know about vitamin D, along with their best advice for getting enough vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is vitamin D good for the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/foods-high-in-vitamin-d" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/jennastangland/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/jennastangland/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/jennastangland/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jenna Stangland&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietician and performance advisor for &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.livemomentous.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.livemomentous.com/"}' href="https://www.livemomentous.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Momentous&lt;/a&gt;, explains, is a hormone that our body can synthesize from UV light. Stangland says it has numerous functions in our body and comes with many benefits. Optimal vitamin D levels are essential for systemic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It regulates cellular growth and gene expression (essential for cancer prevention), improves cell differentiation, and is involved in immunity, fertility, muscle strength, hormone balance, sexual health, energy, mood, and more,” adds &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rhian Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, nutritionist, naturopath, and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://artah.co/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://artah.co/"}' href="https://artah.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Artah&lt;/a&gt;. Put simply, it’s essential for all-around health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens if you’re vitamin D deficient?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency impacts both physical and mental health. When vitamin D is low, Stangland explains that there is decreased absorption of calcium and phosphorus into the bones, which puts you at risk of bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-vitamin-d"&gt;Low levels&lt;/a&gt; are also linked to poor immunity and increased risk of serious health conditions such as cancer. “Vitamin D has been shown to play a role in cancer prevention and treatment,” she explains. “[It] inhibits cell proliferation in cancerous tissues and also downregulates certain cells involved in inflammatory signaling in cancer.” Other poor outcomes include autoimmune conditions, COVID-19, hormone health, and mood disorders, Stephenson. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, fibromyalgia, and neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, are all also linked to vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who eat a vegan diet or who have celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic fibrosis are particularly at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Others who are at risk are babies who are breastfed, older adults, those with dark skin tones, and those who weigh above their standard body mass index (BMI). According to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;, breast milk’s vitamin D levels are lower than the required amounts and also dependent on the mother’s vitamin D levels. When it comes to older people or those with darker skin tones, the NIH explains that our skin has a harder time synthesizing vitamin D as we age or if we have melanin in the epidermal layer that reduces the skin’s ability to do so. Those who may be dealing with excess fat won’t necessarily have a problem absorbing vitamin D, but the NIH says that they will need more of it to be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to truly know if you are vitamin D deficient is to have a blood test via your general practitioner. However, there are also signs and symptoms you can look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a severe vitamin D deficiency, one of the most common symptoms is a feeling of chronic, profound, or irremediable fatigue. To add to that, poor sleep is another symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Bone and muscle pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and frequent muscle pain and weakness. Meanwhile, bone and joint pain are common, as vitamin D is essential for the body to absorb calcium—without it, increased fragility and pain may occur. So for the sake of your bone health, vitamin D is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s essential for healthy hair that grows optimally. A deficiency can cause hair to fall out or slow growth because a deficiency intervenes with a follicle’s life cycle. Alopecia is also believed to be related to vitamin D insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;You’re often sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a weak immune system. If you’re often ill and don’t know why, consider getting a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research shows that vitamin D may play a key role in balancing our mood and minimizing the risk of depression. Low levels can contribute to seasonal affective disorder and are often associated with feelings of being overwhelmed, sadness, anxiety, forgetfulness, and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you get vitamin D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serotonin-vitamin-d-daylight" target="_blank"&gt;sunlight exposure&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way to stimulate the production of vitamin D in the body, which is why we’re particularly vulnerable to deficiency in the dark winter months. “The NHS recommends supplementing with vitamin D3 throughout autumn and the winter months for this reason,” explains Stephenson. Stangland recommends getting at least 20 minutes of sun exposure to keep vitamin D levels at a healthy amount. (Just be sure to always &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vogue-editors-sunscreen" target="_blank"&gt;wear sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; to protect your skin from sun damage and to prevent skin cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:26:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE96UWlpQWdrN2RQLW9EaHpVTXQwNE5qaktnZmVabnk4dGR1QzItYU16cTEwSDVEVEVGeGNPaTZ6Y05YajNDelR5dW1XR3prdk9tLVBuLW9xcmF3dXN4TDhz</guid></item><item><title>多动症：女性的私人诊断导致“改变生活”的药物- BBC | ADHD: Woman's private diagnosis led to 'life changing' medication - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5pOWhxYzZ6SEhqSlAyQzQ3UnMydmFzY2t0SXpnM0R2Z1VjdVdhcDJxT1NMUlo0TUFwU2x2RVFhdEU1dnp0RGM3d3RSRHZXcHgyX1pLTWZmMHV5Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE4wTzVNYTVFRWpINkpVazJXcnR2bV8tTkg3cXhsQTg2U2tTMnZzekpFTWEwSlVMX3hIOHRGbGhleFNmNURyLUxidnpnV3ZzVGRwWkZTY2tWby1PWmtPNmpV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Woman's private ADHD diagnosis led to 'life-changing' medication&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Aileen Moynagh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News NI health reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/595e/live/de113060-1618-11f0-89a1-d79513460a0a.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A woman with short blonde hair wearing a green jacket and white top smiling at the camera.

which allows "seamless shared care and decision making" between her, her private specialist consultant, and her GP "in relation to medicines use".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was able to manage all the things that I need to do every day like picking up the child from school, cooking a dinner, tidying up round me, looking after the garden, walking the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It made such a difference that I finally felt more like myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Cousins said she loves the fact she has ADHD because she said many people are creative as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She writes songs and poetry, and has recently written a book about her childhood, educating about the signs, symptoms, and behaviours of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Sarah Salters from ADD-NI said the lack of services for adults is "diabolical"&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://adhduk.co.uk/the-history-of-adhd/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;ADHD was first recognised in adults in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, eight years after childhood ADHD was formally recognised through National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in most of the UK NHS (England, Wales, and NI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The DoH said whilst a level of provision is available, it is aware that "this has also led to inconsistencies between trusts".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sarah Salters, CEO of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://addni.org/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;ADD-NI&lt;/a&gt;, said the charity receives a high number of weekly referrals for ADHD support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since January they have had 165 referrals, with almost half of those for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the lack of services within the health service for adults is "diabolical", leaving adults "very frustrated" with "nowhere to turn".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Salters said many people are "forced" to go private for a diagnosis and also have difficulty getting medication as not all GPs honour the shared care protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"About 4% of our adult population have ADHD, that's about 70,000 people across Northern Ireland and there's possibly a very high number of people who are undiagnosed," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Where you get the right support, the proper strategies in place, people with ADHD start to see that they can do things that they weren't capable of doing before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The DoH has commissioned a "needs assessment" with a view to bringing forward recommendations to inform a commissioned ADHD service, which is expected to be completed by the end of June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It said any decision "will be based on an assessment of the level of demand for services, and in the context of future budget availability".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Salters is not confident services will be commissioned as she does not think ADHD is seen as a "priority".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5pOWhxYzZ6SEhqSlAyQzQ3UnMydmFzY2t0SXpnM0R2Z1VjdVdhcDJxT1NMUlo0TUFwU2x2RVFhdEU1dnp0RGM3d3RSRHZXcHgyX1pLTWZmMHV5Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE4wTzVNYTVFRWpINkpVazJXcnR2bV8tTkg3cXhsQTg2U2tTMnZzekpFTWEwSlVMX3hIOHRGbGhleFNmNURyLUxidnpnV3ZzVGRwWkZTY2tWby1PWmtPNmpV</guid></item><item><title>随着病例增加，现在多纳安娜县出现麻疹- KOAT | Measles now in Dona Ana County as cases increase - KOAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZWdlNkRBTXIzb0p6WnE0VmhLMi1rcms0TXB6cHlEYTh3WGRmV0YtYy1YcXlNM2NfQWVGNWdnOGdJanFoV09GUEpsLWY3VXItMXczTTBuY3V1bEtmY18yQ19fT1FtZnJQbVU1d3dfT3JGMGJkc3o4S2xXX1Z2QzhjTzI0S2ZLRnM0TmppbE1Xbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						Measles has been diagnosed in an unvaccinated child in Dona Ana County, making it the first reported case there, a New Mexico Department of Health news release said.Dona Ana County residents may have been exposed to measles earlier this month in Las Cruces at the Kid's Kountry Place Preschool and Childcare and the Memorial Medical Center's Family Medicine Center, Emergency Department and Pediatric Unit.  There are now 63 cases of measles in New Mexico, counting four new cases in Lea County of people who have not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease has also been reported in Chaves and Eddy counties. With the number of cases increasing, the NMDOH is recommending that the MMR vaccine be given to infants from 6-11 months old who live in Dona Ana County, or will be traveling to Dona Ana and Lea counties.At the same time, the number of people getting vaccinations to prevent measles has almost doubled from Feb. 1 to April 4 over the same period last year — from 9,863 to 18,449 , the release said.Information on measles symptoms, and guidance from nurses, is available on the NMDOH helpline at 1-833-796-8773 and online at measles.doh.nm.gov.

Just over 6.5% of participants had a slow walking pace, 53% had an average walking pace and 41% had a brisk walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Tracking these individuals for an average of 13 years showed that 36,574 participants (9%) developed some form of heart rhythm abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for background demographic and lifestyle factors, an average or brisk walking pace was associated with, respectively, a 35% and 43% lower risk of all heart rhythm abnormalities compared with a slow walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These higher walking speeds were also associated with lower risks of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the amount of time spent walking at a slow pace was not associated with the risk of developing heart rhythm abnormalities, more time spent walking at an average or brisk pace was associated with a 27% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Overall, around 36% of the association between walking pace and all heart rhythm abnormalities was influenced by metabolic and inflammatory factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Demographic and lifestyle factors accounted for by the study included that participants reporting a faster walking pace were more likely to be men and tended to live in less deprived areas and have healthier lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Atrial fibrillation is a condition where the heart’s upper chambers beat irregularly and too fast, while ventricular arrhythmias occur when an abnormal heart rhythm starts in the lower chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Heart rhythm problems can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and cardiac arrest if left untreated. They can occur when there is a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers noted that the study was observational, meaning that no firm conclusions could be drawn on whether walking at a brisk pace was a direct cause of a lower risk of heart rhythm abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study was also limited by the fact the participants were self reported and did not reflect a broad spectrum of ages and ethnic backgrounds. The average age was 55, 55% were women and 97% were white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers, led by Prof Jill Pell of the University of Glasgow, said: “This study is the first to explore the pathways underpinning the association between walking pace and arrhythmias, and to provide evidence that metabolic and inflammatory factors may have a role: walking faster decreased the risk of obesity and inflammation, which, in turn, reduced the risk of arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This finding is biologically plausible because cumulative epidemiological studies have shown that walking pace is inversely associated with metabolic factors, such as obesity, HbA1c [fasting glucose], diabetes, and [high blood pressure] which, in turn, are associated with the risk of arrhythmias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPdlBLQ3VFN0s5b2xCUFVHbGJsMzlINGRsa0g4X1RNMWJmaUJTOGhaa3RxY25fNVFySmRaX3A5cTlLMVlOSmY0TTcxN1FKYzJfQXdPMC1FaE1OTEF5VGpkRV84NWJpSFJQQTNqRDFmVHhMX0hmTEtIejZ6eHlxS3NDbjhjc1pTZGlrQlhjUEF2YXRzemh3Yy1POWNOZmpDX0t3RmZZX1RCZUpsSi1YeWpqMTBVeUx5YmFtX053</guid></item><item><title>“我们只是不确切知道它是什么” |乔治亚州中部兽医看到狗神秘疾病的增加- 13WMAZ | 'We just don't know exactly what it is' | Central Georgia vets seeing rise of mystery illness in dogs - 13WMAZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPWFJIZlZpRUFObi1jZzBKdHZ0RURIaVdjZGU0NXdjUjFWWVBzOGhLTkFHVzlXSnFhTHh3WmdjcDRrSUF5LVlFRmlZNjR3WmZHVEg2X1F2Sm5EV0psOHdZOEdrWjhWYk16R1d4ZVNIdXBxU0hxS1JvaG9NLVVWN2g5MG9iT0xXN0NZQWlocW9Bb2UtQ1QyVDRGbGl4dEQ2SkluMTYyRWNGZFlENS1BUU1xcll5dlpNSXRiemRpQWx3VmwzdmxDNFd1ZWg4Zi1Jdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Veterinarians are alarmed by a rising unknown respiratory illness in dogs across Central Georgia. Here's what we found.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MACON, Ga. — A mysterious respiratory illness affecting dogs in &lt;a href="/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Central Georgia&lt;/a&gt; has veterinarians concerned as cases continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Veterinary Medical Association has identified an unknown respiratory disease that has been circulating among dogs in the region, with a notable spike in cases over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think because we just don't know exactly what it is and because if we cultured and took a swab of one dog that's not necessarily what it's gonna be for every dog," said Mary Frances Wylie, a veterinarian at Northside Wesleyan Animal Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wylie says that her clinic has treated approximately 15 dogs with the mysterious illness in the past two months alone.  She says the most common symptoms include a whooping cough-like condition and unusually low energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says it is difficult to track exact numbers because the disease remains unidentified. What makes this illness particularly concerning is its resistance to standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This illness doesn't respond as well to antibiotic treatments and sometimes requires several rounds of medication," according to the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the outbreak she says appears to correlate with increased dog interactions at boarding facilities and daycare centers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More dogs go to boarding, grooming, day cares. We just had Spring Break, President's Day, so a lot of families go out of town," she said. "That's really when it becomes more prevalent is when dogs become in close proximity to each other."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness is airborne, making it difficult to avoid completely. However, she recommends preventative measures for concerned pet owners.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Really staying on top of your vaccines with your vet, talking to them about what vaccines that your dog needs and what they're at risk for, avoiding high traffic dog areas if you can help it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most healthy dogs can safely continue normal activities, certain pets face higher risks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have an older dog with heart issues or breathing issues, those are the dogs that I would probably [be concerned about]," Dr. Wiley said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that for these vulnerable animals, "maybe just with time and avoiding dog parks, daycares if you're worried" would be the safest approach.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says that vaccination remains an important protective measure and hopes more pet owners will keep their animals' vaccines current as experts work to identify and combat this mysterious respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to monitor the situation and urge dog owners to contact their veterinarians if their pets show symptoms of respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Hanks had a case reported on Monday and Bel Air also had a case reported a few days ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials have initiated contact tracing to identify potential exposures and are coordinating with state partners to prevent further spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although approximately 98 percent of El Paso County residents are vaccinated against measles. Unvaccinated individuals remain at the highest risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOMMENDED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/measles-case-reported-in-dona-ana-county-1st-in-southeast-new-mexico?SRC=LINK" target="_blank" title="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/measles-case-reported-in-dona-ana-county-1st-in-southeast-new-mexico?SRC=LINK" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles case reported in Doña Ana County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine (MMR) is highly effective but not 100% foolproof, health officials said. Two doses provide approximately 97% protection, meaning a small number of vaccinated individuals may still contract the virus—particularly during outbreaks or in cases of weakened immune response. However, vaccinated individuals who become infected are far less likely to experience serious complications or transmit the virus to others, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;POTENTIAL EXPOSURE LOCATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the following locations on the dates and times noted should verify their immunization status and monitor for symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DateLocationTime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/04/2025Walmart; 1850 Zaragoza4:45 p.m. – 7:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/05/2025El Paso International Airport 6701 Convair8 a.m. – 11:20 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/07/2025 El Paso International Airport 6701 Convair1:30 p.m. – 3:50 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/04/2025Los Toreado 5331 Marcillus6:30 p.m. – 9:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who: (1) visited any of the locations above on the specified dates and times, and (2) develops a fever and rash, should contact their healthcare provider immediately for evaluation and testing.

When citizens identify ideologically with such leaders, they become more hostile toward political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This polarization is driven not by opposing politicians but by the actions and rhetoric of the leaders they support. The findings suggest that emotionally manipulative leadership poses a threat to democratic norms and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Triad Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Politicians high in narcissism, psychopathy, or Machiavellianism intensify hostility among their supporters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporter Identification:&lt;/strong&gt; The more voters identify with these leaders, the more polarized and hostile their views become.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy at Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; These traits can erode trust, reduce cooperation, and weaken democratic institutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politicians who exhibit ‘dark’ personality traits such as narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism contribute to increasing affective polarisation among citizens. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a new study conducted by the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the University of Lausanne and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Political Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108788"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a shadowy politician on a stage." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Remarkably, the personality traits of political opponents have little to no effect on the degree of polarisation. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers linked the personality profiles of over 90 prominent politicians worldwide with voter attitudes in 40 national elections. The results reveal striking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians who score high on the so-called Dark Triad – narcissism (excessive self-focus), psychopathy (emotional coldness and lack of empathy), and Machiavellianism (a tendency toward manipulation and deception) – are associated with greater hostility toward political opponents among their followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polarisation from within&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers show that dark traits have an effect when voters feel ideologically close to the politician in question. The stronger the identification, the more likely supporters are to adopt hostile stances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Machiavellian politicians in particular – strategic, manipulative, goal-driven – appear to be catalysts for affective polarisation: they deepen emotional divides between their supporters and others,’ explains Alessandro Nai, researcher at the UvA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remarkably, the personality traits of political opponents have little to no effect on the degree of polarisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nai: ‘We know today that voters tend to take cues from politicians they feel close to, and are more likely to ignore messages from politicians they disagree with. It is thus our own politicians who make us angrier, fuel hostile thinking towards others, and contribute to affective polarisation. And this can have dramatic consequences.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominant leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Viktor Orbán, Narendra Modi, Silvio Berlusconi, Shinzo Abe, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and many others. Dutch politicians such as Mark Rutte and Geert Wilders were also part of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no individual scores are disclosed, the researchers emphasise a broader trend: during times of political tension, voters tend to prefer dominant, hardline leaders, even when they exhibit norm-breaking or confrontational behaviour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings cast a critical light on the global rise of ‘dark’ leaders. According to the researchers, the confrontational and uncompromising personality traits of such leaders pose clear risks to democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘When the personal traits of leaders poison public discourse, the public’s willingness to cooperate weakens, social cohesion suffers, and ultimately democratic norms erode,’ says co-author Katjana Gattermann of the UvA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers call for greater awareness of the role (dark) personality plays in political leadership, in particular when these traits appear in strongmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nai concludes: ‘We have shown in previous research that dark personality traits are particularly frequent in authoritarian leaders and populists; the evidence seems thus to be piling up that narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism are important phenomena if we want to understand why politics, today, seems so confrontational.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and politics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d6d786f6e6b72726f71747e756974737a5d686b7c337371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Laura Erdtsieck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uva.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Laura Erdtsieck – University of Amsterdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.70002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ripping the public apart?

Politicians’ dark personality and affective polarization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence exists about the importance of dark personality traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in political leaders, broadly leading to heightened political aggressiveness and partisan conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this expanding research agenda, we study the possible association between dark personality in politicians and deepened affective polarization – that is, increased affective distance between partisan groups coupled with stronger dislike for out-parties – in the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do so by linking a large-scale expert survey (NEGex) and a collection of post-election surveys (CSES), including information for more than 90 leading candidates having competed in 40 elections worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the dark personality of top politicians can be associated with upticks in affective polarization in the public – but only when it comes to the personality of in-party candidates (that is, a candidate from voters’ preferred party), and only for high levels of ideological proximity between the candidate and the voter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:32:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5IekhISGtsSFRYYkRfcjQ1RTlWOURQSlRpMjY1UkstY0xXbFJkamdYc2taTUV6OFg5ZDBsWTV4bV92R1dRbjFfVDV1TUVlRWJvdTlsWUlONE04bTVSTUpuSDhtR21EWXdsN0tKaWtUeE84OXgzMXdv</guid></item><item><title>科学所说的4种食物可以帮助你活到100岁-财富 | The 4 foods that science says can help you live to 100 - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5BTFNIMFZITGlkLVBIVXZVdHEzaHJ3ZXlsMUEzd19qTkxEaHhYZGRFZFVuWGMzYWdmSmdXNFdRcURlRmZLeWVDR3lyMnRram1yd3ptQWlmSEg3MGRWSUhvTXpiY21DeXRudGZWN253?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5BTFNIMFZITGlkLVBIVXZVdHEzaHJ3ZXlsMUEzd19qTkxEaHhYZGRFZFVuWGMzYWdmSmdXNFdRcURlRmZLeWVDR3lyMnRram1yd3ptQWlmSEg3MGRWSUhvTXpiY21DeXRudGZWN253</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州麻疹疫情加剧；宾夕法尼亚州密歇根州报告新疫情- CIDRAP | Texas measles outbreak grows; Michigan, Pennsylvania report new outbreaks - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOLWtNdEExcnM5M1NWY1N3WEpFMkswTWVCcWFsZ2gzU01pVWVPSllBdkRaSVl0X3ZaWGhOd2VDUTBDRVZna1hWSTk4VzR5VHJyWk5XZE5HT1ozOTVuYVNXckZnem43dmdJQXEtU0pYWk5hczFiaVlKbVV1Q3RlWUY4OHlRNklLSE5tOVdwUWxLcFpWSWlueXcyd1dZeE1SY2E2LWt1a1dJNDZjZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas has reported&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 20 more measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cases in the past 5 days.

And last month, a person with measles &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/25/dc-measles-case/"&gt;traveled&lt;/a&gt; from Minnesota to visit D.C. while contagious. That person had ridden an Amtrak train, walked through the concourse at Union Station and went to an urgent care center in Adams Morgan a few days later, according to the city health department. This year, there have been more than 700 confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/measles-is-spreading-heres-how-to-stay-safe/" target="_blank"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two people died of measles-related illness. Another death is currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K2AHDLBW7RBGVJ2UK4ZUQX3VLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://dchealth.dc.gov/page/measles-information-healthcare-providers"&gt;Measles &lt;/a&gt;is a highly contagious disease and spreads easily through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs or breathes. Symptoms can show up from seven to 14 days after exposure and may include a fever of over 101 degrees, along with a cough, red and watery eyes and a runny nose. After the initial symptoms begin, there is another stage three to five days later. It includes a distinctive rash on the face that spreads to the rest of the body. Health officials said someone with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPAMNZIFEJASJGHLGQ7IATEAUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Officials said in a statement that if a person has received “two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.” For someone who has received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, health officials said, “you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures if very low.” But they advise contacting a health-care provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RJKLWZW2YVFSHAUZ7JNTMWD6VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those who are exposed and at risk of developing measles should look for symptoms until 21 days after the date of their last exposure. If a person notices symptoms of measles, officials said, they should isolate themselves by staying home and away from others and get in touch with a health-care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-correction" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div data-qa="correction-disclaimer" class="wpds-c-fZDGxM wpds-c-fZDGxM-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="disclaimer-headline" class="wpds-c-kAVFVG"&gt;correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="YZE5I2QQNFCLFOVTAQP6JZYKTI" data-apitype="correction" data-testid="disclaimer-description" class="wpds-c-joLgjs"&gt;A previous version of this article incorrectly said there have been nearly 490 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The foods we eat can influence our cholesterol levels and overall heart health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While foods like oats, vegetable oils and beans get a bad reputation, they are great fits for a heart-healthy diet to lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting saturated fat and prioritizing fiber can help support healthy cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cholesterol can be a tricky topic for some. It is a type of waxy, fat-like substance that our bodies need in order to build cells and make vitamins and other hormones. That said, too much of it can lead to complications in the body, such as heart disease. There are also two different types of cholesterol in our body: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;LDL and HDL&lt;/a&gt;. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, can build up as plaque in the arteries. On the other hand, HDL acts as a scavenger to pick up and remove excess cholesterol and plaque, which is why it’s called “good” cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Learning how to manage high cholesterol can be difficult, but there are ways to lower cholesterol through heart-healthy eating habits. However, there is so much conflicting information regarding nutrition that it can feel hard to decide what foods to eat. But here are some “bad” foods that actually help lower cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats are a type of whole grain that many might deem too high in carbohydrates, but oats are also high in fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly important for our bodies, as it’s crucial for heart healthy, healthy digestion, gut health and more. Oats are a type of soluble fiber that becomes a thick gel in our intestines, which slows digestion and keeps blood sugar levels from spiking. Soluble fiber can also help trap excess fat and cholesterol particles so they can't all be absorbed, which can lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One half cup of dry cereal has 4 grams of fiber as well as 5 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having one bowl in the morning along with some berries or yogurt can not only increase the fiber intake, but also increase the heart-healthy vitamins and minerals in your morning meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vegetable-oils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Vegetable Oils &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetable oils have been circulating on social media for their adverse health effects; however, these negative claims have not been backed by science. In fact, research has linked vegetable oils like canola with improved heart health and lower LDL levels. Using canola oil in place of butter or other high-saturated fat cooking products can be beneficial for health. This is because it has a lower saturated fat content and is higher in polyunsaturated fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which can be beneficial for managing cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canola is a neutral-tasting oil and is great for dressings, grilling, baking and stir frying. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mercury content might be associated with large fish, which can sound scary, but there are many varieties that are not only low in mercury, but also great for our health. Fish is not only a great source of protein, but it's also packed with heart-healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish include varieties like salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel and trout. Regularly eating fish and seafood is consistently associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; can lower triglyceride levels, may slow down the growth of plaques in the arteries and help reduce inflammation throughout the body.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some folks are hesitant about fruit because of its sugar content, but it’s important to note that all sugar found in fruit is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;naturally-occurring&lt;/a&gt; and not added sugar. Fruit is also rich in fiber, and some fruit, such as apples with the peel, strawberries and citrus, contain pectin which is a type of soluble fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adding more soluble fiber to your day is a great way to support healthy cholesterol levels. Fruit can be added to cereal, smoothies, yogurt, salads or eaten on its own as a simple snack or side. Eating a variety of fruit not only contributes to your daily fiber intake, but it also adds to your vitamins and minerals intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans might be considered “bad” to some because they are high in carbohydrates. However, they are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complex carbs&lt;/a&gt; and are rich in fiber. Beans are especially high in soluble fiber which means that they will take more time for the body to digest, so you feel full for longer after a meal. There are so many varieties of beans available which all offer health benefits including black beans, navy beans, kidney beans, lentils, garbanzos, black-eyed peas and more. They are very accessible as many are sold ready-to-eat in cans which makes them easier to store and quicker to cook. If you are worried about the sodium content of canned beans, make sure to rinse off the liquid found in the cans before consuming and try to choose “no-salt-added” varieties when you can.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocados do have high fat content, which might be a concern for some people, but it’s a healthy kind of fat known as monounsaturated fat. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avocados&lt;/a&gt; are also high in fiber—one whole avocado contains about 10 grams—which can improve HDL and decrease LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some research has even found that swapping avocados for other high-saturated fat foods like butter, cheese or processed meats can significantly lower heart disease risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avocados are a great addition to salads, sandwiches, spread on toast, on top of eggs or as a dip for vegetables or chips.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing high cholesterol might feel overwhelming, but there are foods that can help keep your levels within a healthy range. Overall, try to limit foods high in saturated fats and opt for foods that are higher in fiber. Soluble fiber absorbs water as it moves through your digestive system and forms a gel. As it passes through your intestines, soluble fiber prevents your body from absorbing some fat and cholesterol, helping to manage cholesterol levels. Including a variety of foods, like oats, vegetable oils, beans, fruits and avocados, can help support a healthier heart.

but is widely used off-label for weight loss — especially among celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, fans are speculating that stars like &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/sharon-osbourne/index.html" id="mol-07f2ca00-1a16-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;Sharon Osbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/oprah-winfrey/index.html" id="mol-07f08010-1a16-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt; Winfrey may be among the first to show signs of the surprising foot-related side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osbourne, 72, recently posted a cozy Instagram photo with her grandson — but eagle-eyed commenters were quick to point out signs of extreme weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, TV spectators have also noticed excessive wrinkling on 71-year-old Oprah's feet when the American host and television producer was seen onstage at the 55th NAACP Image Awards at Shrine Auditorium in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-07f784f0-1a16-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sharon Osbourne took to Instagram to share a cozy picture of herself with her two-year-old grandson and pet dog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skin on the top of the foot is delicate, thin and has lower fat reserves than the bottom or sole of the foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As you age, the fat pads in the foot can become even more scarce and lead to loose skin and wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking weight loss drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro can significantly reduce the fat reserves in the whole body, including the feet - leading to excessive sagging and wrinkles due to muscle loss, Dr Weintraub said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eagle eyed fans were quick to notice the strange wrinkling on Osbourne's feet in her Instagram post from April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The star's perfectly smooth facial complexion, which some users claimed was achieved with a filter, contrasted her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Instagrammer commented: 'Beautiful airbrushed photo but feet tell your age'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While another quipped: 'How strange when the skin on your hands and feet don't match the skin on your face'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, while many thought that she was simply showing signs of aging, Dr Weintraub believes otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained to this website: 'Seeing veiny and sagging skin on the top and sides of the foot is most likely a result of the new lack of water retention due to a decreased BMI caused by Ozempic and other such weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the heart becomes less taxed with extra weight, the water retention decreases, and the substructures of the foot (veins, tendons, bones) often become more visible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, Winfrey said taking weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14315339/oprah-winfrey-ozempic-realize-truth-people.html"&gt;helped her realize the truth about 'thin people.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the media mogul finally admitted to using an undisclosed GLP-1 - a type 2 diabetes medication that can also aid in weight loss - to shed nearly 50 pounds after decades of yo-yo dieting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having nearly reached her goal weight of 160 pounds (72kg), Winfrey revealed her experience taking a GLP-1 and what it has taught her about 'thin people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the things that I realized the very first time I took a GLP-1 was that all these years I thought that thin people had more willpower,' Winfrey confessed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon exclusively told DailyMail.com that a loss of fat in the body can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

UCSF estimates that 93 million CT scans were performed in the U.S. in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the number of CT scans performed in the U.S. has increased by 30% since 2007. UCSF scientists say that this should give pause to medical professionals about whether the benefits of CT scans outweigh the risks. UCSF noted in a press release that its research might indicate that CT scans are being overused for instances of upper respiratory infections and common headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Few patients and their families are counseled about the risks associated with CT examinations,” study co-author Malini Mahendra, UCSF assistant professor of Pediatric Critical Care, said in a press release. “We hope our study’s findings will help clinicians better quantify and communicate these cancer risks, allowing for more informed conversations when weighing the benefits and risks of CT exams.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/medicine/rfk-jr-weighs-options-for-medicare-medicaid-coverage-of-glp-1-medications" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;RFK Jr. weighs options for Medicare, Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stated in a press release that the largest number of cancers in adults was due to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, while children faced a higher risk of cancer following CT scans of the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic states that CT scans use ionizing radiation to help capture images but generally carry little risk. CT scans can help show heart disease, blood clots, bone fractures, certain types of cancer, among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A CT scan is an imaging test that helps healthcare providers detect diseases and injuries," the Cleveland Clinic says. "It uses a series of X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of your bones and soft tissues. A CT scan is painless and noninvasive. You might go to a hospital or imaging center for your CT scan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCSF researchers believe that there are some instances where CT scans should either be performed at a lower intensity or avoided altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the large volume of CT use in the United States, many cancers could occur in the future if current practices don’t change,” said the study's first author, Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a UCSF radiologist. “Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight. Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/ozempic-wegovy-may-be-linked-to-increased-risk-of-condition-that-causes-blindness-new-study-shows" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Ozempic, Wegovy may be linked to increased risk of condition that causes blindness, new study shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Beans provide healthy plant protein along with fiber and other beneficial nutrients like polyphenols.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Whole grains are higher in protein than many expect while offering fiber and various micronutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Reducing red and processed meat consumption benefits health while diversifying plant proteins provides all necessary amino acids.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Nuts and seeds are solid sources of plant protein and have healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/li&gt;

            Americans are in the middle of a love-affair with protein.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000g3b6mh8ozsgna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A stroll through almost any major supermarket — where food labels tout grams of protein — bears witness to the trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000h3b6my9qedpi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And why shouldn’t we be? Along with carbohydrates and fat, protein is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594226/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the three main macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; that make up our diet. Furthermore, it is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, making it essential for survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000i3b6mysdz95lv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557845/" target="_blank"&gt;Amino acids&lt;/a&gt; have a hand in &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002222.htm" target="_blank"&gt;many bodily processes&lt;/a&gt;, such as building and preserving muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting the immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. And while our bodies can make some of the needed amino acids, it can’t make them all. Enter dietary protein.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000j3b6mjkoixlbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is the optimal amount you should be getting? The answer is that it’s complicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000k3b6mtf4ryifw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;recommended dietary allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) of protein for adults 18 and older is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound) per day, which translates to about 54 grams of protein for a 150-pound person, or 72 grams for someone weighing 200 pounds. &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp/dietary-guidelines-americans" target="_blank"&gt;Established jointly&lt;/a&gt; by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Health and Human Services, the RDA represents the minimum amount of protein that must be eaten by a relatively sedentary person to meet the basic needs of their body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000l3b6m2fevekr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also something called the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR), which was developed by the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/dietary-reference-intakes-for-macronutrients" target="_blank"&gt;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; to establish ranges for carbohydrates, fat and protein that are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Those guidelines, which put intake within the context of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm" target="_blank"&gt;an entire diet&lt;/a&gt;, recommend protein make up between &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/7" target="_blank"&gt;10% and 35%&lt;/a&gt; of the calories in an adult’s diet. (The &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan" target="_blank"&gt;number of calories per day&lt;/a&gt; an adult should be getting depends on characteristics such as age, sex, weight and activity level.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000m3b6mfc1637j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All that is to say, there is no exact number for the amount of protein that you should be getting. If you look at &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2017_March%202020.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the statistics&lt;/a&gt;, most people in the United States are getting more than enough; if you listen to some influencers, you are not getting enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000n3b6mdmhc4pqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was in L.A., and I did some interviews there, and nine out of 10 people I asked, ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ — it was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing,” Dr. Tim Spector told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. Spector is a genetic epidemiologist and researcher at King’s College London and founder of one of the world’s largest twins registries, TWINS UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000o3b6mhhvkvxg7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’ve been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they’re somehow deficient and they’re not going to be lean and have a six-pack and be running marathons (if they don’t),” he said. Spector is also author of several best-selling books including “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Life-Science-bestselling-SPOON-FED/dp/1787330494" target="_blank"&gt;Food for Life: The New Science of Eating Well&lt;/a&gt;.” (He’s also a co-founder of ZOE, a personalized nutrition app).

            Spector has nothing at all against protein per se. “In general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it’s plant protein — but, nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation. But it’s what it replaces,” he said. “We need to start thinking much more holistically.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000s3b6m4x0zk6a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein,” he added. “There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount, and &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt; 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber.&lt;/a&gt;”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000t3b6mxm8gxn9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spector said certain groups may require a bit more protein: older adults, people going through &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/menopause-fatigue-heavy-bleeding-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;   or recovering from serious illness, those with restrictive diets and people who are “training incredibly hard.” But the rest of us — in the United States, at least — do just fine. (Many people &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-per-capita-protein-supply" target="_blank"&gt;in developing countries&lt;/a&gt; do not &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/pabra-new-beans-africa-spc/index.html"&gt;get adequate protein&lt;/a&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000u3b6m6ibwkxg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you find that you need it, how can you get some additional high-quality protein into your diet — while benefiting from other important nutrients and without relying on highly processed sweetened powders and snack bars? Here are Spector’s top five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000x3b6mmbnqg4yn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They come in many forms — black, pinto, broad, kidney, and more — but they never get the attention they deserve,”  said Spector via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000y3b6mdyq1xuxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re all good sources of healthy plant protein,” he noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000z3b6mxv3rdano@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beans are also loaded with other good-for-you nutrients. “Importantly, they also contain fiber (a nutrient that most people really are deficient in), and other healthy plant compounds, like polyphenols,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00103b6mr1x27xvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Load up on the three-bean salad or bean burrito. Those &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/15/health/canned-dried-beans-recipes-wellness/index.html"&gt;bean are inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;, come in a wide variety and, if you buy them dried, are extremely shelf-stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00123b6m3aqrgsy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearty and versatile, whole grains — such as barley, brown rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn, millet, oats, quinoa, rye and whole wheat — contain the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ and endosperm.

            “Whole grains are good for a wide range of reasons,” said Spector via email. “They are a great source of fiber and include a wide range of micronutrients. They’re also much higher in protein than people expect. For instance, oats have 11g of protein per 100g compared with 13g per 100g for eggs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Regularly consuming whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of many health conditions, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes,” he noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00153b6m92ukwn8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An easy way to get more in your diet? “Swap products that contain highly refined grains — like white rice, pasta, and bread — for whole grain versions, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and wholewheat bread,” he said.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many of us love a good burger or steak, but eating too much of a good thing is not so good for you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00193b6m8itw2uin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s true that meat is a great source of protein,” Spector said. “However, for your health and the health of the planet, it’s best to reduce your meat intake, particularly red and processed meat.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001a3b6mmf3swdc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some people worry that most plants are not complete proteins, so they might be missing out on specific amino acids,” he noted. “But each plant source of protein has a unique amino acid profile. By consuming a wide variety of plants, you will naturally take in all the amino acids you need.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001b3b6mctxn0qo0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And  don’t panic. Nobody is saying you have to cut out meat entirely. “Consider replacing half of the meat in your stews, chilis, or soups with mixed lentils and beans, tofu, or tempeh, or have one or two vegetarian or pescetarian days each week,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001c3b6m4zxgu775@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you do eat meat, Spector added, “try to choose good quality products and opt for leaner cuts.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9hlioi7001r3b6muj52kxhg@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="go-nuts-over-nuts-and-seeds" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Go nuts over nuts and seeds
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001e3b6mtm283mae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people avoid nuts and seeds because they’re relatively high in fat,” Spector said. “Although this is true, they contain healthy unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which support good health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001f3b6mqqlnkohu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may come as no surprise to find “they’re also a good source of healthy plant protein and a wide range of vitamins and minerals,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001g3b6mrrgndqmt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not a fan of munching on straight-up nuts or seeds, Spector said you can sprinkle them on most dishes “savory or sweet — to provide extra texture and flavor.” Consider adding them to your yogurt parfait, salad or stew.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001h3b6meegofhe2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Peanut butter is also a good choice, he said, “but find a product with as few ingredients as possible, and no added sugar or salt.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001k3b6mfx3c1ppl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Soy is one of the few complete proteins in the plant world,” Spector said. “It’s also incredibly versatile and can easily be incorporated into meals. Consider adding tofu, tempeh or edamame to the dishes you already love.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001l3b6mrphcx2g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As an added bonus, he said, “soy products contain fiber and are rich in vitamins and minerals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001m3b6m5tkcla2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to protein, Spector said most people should seek out quality over quantity. “Focus on plants, and ignore products that claim to be high in protein, because they’re probably also high in salt, sugar, and other additives your body doesn’t need,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001n3b6mnqqxaw3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For over fifty years&lt;/strong&gt;, the scientific community has grappled with an unsolved puzzle in the realm of human blood types. It all began in 1972 when doctors discovered something extraordinary during the blood analysis of a pregnant woman. Her blood sample lacked a surface molecule that was otherwise present on every other known red blood cell. After decades of research, scientists have finally cracked the case, unveiling a &lt;strong&gt;new blood group system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Blood Group Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough, &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/144/26/2735/517404/Deletions-in-the-MAL-gene-result-in-loss-of-Mal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, marks a major milestone in the field of hematology. The discovery not only answers an age-old question but also opens the door to improving medical care for individuals with rare blood types. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Louise Tilley, a UK National Health Service hematologist, was instrumental in this accomplishment, having &lt;strong&gt;spent nearly 20 years investigating &lt;/strong&gt;the genetic anomaly. The new &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group adds to the already extensive list of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/scientists-discover-a-second-heart-that-powers-our-blood-circulation/"&gt;blood systems&lt;/a&gt;, such as the well-known &lt;strong&gt;ABO&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rh&lt;/strong&gt; groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; is different from these major systems, being based on the absence of an antigen called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AnWj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;more than 99.9% &lt;/strong&gt;of people have this antigen on their red blood cells. The patient in 1972, however, lacked it entirely, leading to an extensive investigation by a team led by Tilley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the MAL Blood Group?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group gets its name from the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; protein, which is known to play an important role in cell membrane stability and cell transport. The discovery of this new blood group comes after years of research into the genetic cause of &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood types.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers were able to confirm the connection between the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene and the absence of the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt; antigen by inserting a normal &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene into cells from patients who lacked the antigen. This insertion successfully reintroduced the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt; antigen to those cells, confirming the gene’s pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tilley explained that the work was challenging due to the rarity of the condition: “The work was difficult because the genetic cases are very rare.” This rarity made it particularly tough to identify the genetic markers responsible for the anomaly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Underpinnings of MAL&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When individuals possess a mutated version of both copies of their &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; genes, they exhibit an &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood type. This discovery was crucial because it enabled the team to identify patients who carry this rare blood type. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found that some individuals with this blood type did not have the expected genetic mutation, indicating that other medical conditions could suppress the antigen’s presence on the red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers observed that all patients with &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood shared the same mutation. However, no other abnormal cell characteristics or diseases were found to be linked with this &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/mice-with-a-human-gene-mutation-start-talking-differently-and-it-might-be-why-we-speak/"&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identification of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group has substantial medical consequences. As &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; is an extremely rare blood type, understanding its genetic origins enables healthcare professionals to provide better care to patients with this blood group. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, with the discovery of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene, doctors can now test patients to determine whether their &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative status is inherited or caused by some form of genetic suppression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Satchwell, a biologist at the University of the West of England, noted the complexity of identifying the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; protein: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAL is a &lt;strong&gt;very small protein &lt;/strong&gt;with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify and meant we needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

He moved from the US to Europe, where he credits the shift in lifestyle and better food quality for his dramatic results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Striking before-and-after photos of the 33-year-old show a clear difference: his pot belly is gone, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14578141/how-lost-50kg-without-ozempic.html"&gt;replaced by a defined chest&lt;/a&gt;, sculpted obliques, and a healthy glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just about appearances - Dave says blood tests back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before leaving America, his cholesterol levels were flagged as 'elevated.' Eight months into his European life, new tests revealed his numbers had not only dropped, but hit 'optimal' levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dave, who previously lived in Reno, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-d0bb79d0-1a18-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, claims he made zero conscious effort to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-d0b6bee0-1a18-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; or get fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He insists he didn't overhaul his diet or start working out. In fact, he leaned in even harder to indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I arrived in Europe, I didn't follow any diet plans,' he said. 'I drank copious amounts of wine and beer and ate all the local delicacies wherever I went.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't about to pass up the pain au chocolat in Paris or the duck and dumplings in Prague.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after photos of Dave Alastair, 33, show him modeling a svelter physique after his time overseas, and he says medical tests also showed an improvement in his health. His tattoos are flipped in the 'after' photo as it is a mirrored selfie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his indulgent diet, Dave found the pounds dropped off and he puts this down to a variety of differences between Europe and the US when it comes to food and lifestyle choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, the YouTuber believes that 'food in Europe is much more high quality and doesn't have things like additives, fillers (ingredients added to food products primarily to increase volume and bulk), genetically modified organisms and chemicals' in it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingredients distributor Tilley Distribution highlights why this difference in ingredients occurs between the two regions. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It notes: 'In the US, the FDA takes a notably more hands-off approach to testing and inspections, often allowing new food ingredients unless proven harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This includes ingredients, for example, GMOs, growth hormones and chemical preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In Europe, the EFSA requires additives to be proven safe before approval and has banned the use of growth hormones and several chemical additives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe the ultra-processed nature of US food versus European products may play a role in weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, many pasta brands in the US use thickening agents, coloring agents and additives like emulsifiers which prolong their shelf life which have been linked to bloating, sluggishness and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pasta, meanwhile in Europe, is usually made with just semolina wheat flour and water, leaving out the preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And science suggests the lack of processed foods could have real benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study in The Journal of Nutrition, for example, found pasta that is less processed tends to digest slower, slowing down the rate that glucose enters the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amie Alexander, a registered dietitian at Nutri Peak in Australia, previously told DailyMail.com that portion sizes also tend to be smaller in European countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, which could help with digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Meals are also combined with other nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, which can further blunt blood sugar responses.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next up, Dave says he has observed how Europeans drink lots of coffee and smoke more than Americans, which could help in curbing hunger pangs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown that coffee may be beneficial for weight loss when consumed in moderation and without excessive added sugar or cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study followed the coffee habits of more than 150,000 participants and found that drinking unsweetened coffee was associated with a modest reduction in weight gain over four years after adjusting for other lifestyle variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite his indulgent diet, Dave found the pounds dropped off and he puts this down to a variety of differences between Europe and the US when it comes to food and lifestyle choices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A photo of Dave when he was living in America before his transformation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With each additional cup, the coffee drinkers gained about a quarter of a pound less than their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, it is well known that nicotine in cigarettes suppresses appetite and increases metabolism, and also serves as a distraction from hunger or food craving, despite the massive increased risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While he didn't change his workout regime, Dave said he started walking lots more after relocating to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The globetrotter reveals: 'There's no doubt that when I'm in Europe I walk so much more than I do in the United States and I think this is by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the automotive boom in the early 20th century many deals were done to invest heavily in highways instead of trains and that's how America became such a car-centric culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I do think this contributes to Europeans walking a lot more on average than Americans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking after a meal has consistently been shown to help food digest more quickly and gas move throughout the digestive system easier, preventing bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study even found that a two-minute walk after eating helps lower blood sugar levels because muscles will soak up extra glucose in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dave says that food in US grocery stores is generally more unhealthy than in Europe and the fast-food culture is another major culprit in the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains that in America breakfast cereals are 'just made up of corn and sugar' while organic grocery stores such as Whole Foods are only accessible to wealthy shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in Europe healthier food is more accessible, he says, with more fresh produce and farmer's markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the topic of fast food, he tells viewers in one of his YouTube videos: 'I also think it is the culture as well where people in the United States choose the easier faster option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's such a fast-paced life in the United States that sometimes it's easier just to go through a drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After posting about his weight loss experience in Europe, many viewers responded with similar tales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, there are fast food drive-thrus in Europe but most people choose different, healthier options and eat fast food in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fast food in Europe is much smaller portioned than the ones in the United States.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conclude, Dave says he doesn't claim that 'if you move to Europe you will magically lose all of this weight and be super healthy but for some strange reason this has been the case for me and I kind of don't even know how it happened'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After posting about his weight loss experience in Europe, many viewers responded with similar tales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commenter wrote: 'I lived in Barcelona for a year and the same thing happened to me. And I ate all the things; fresh bread and other baked goods, fried things and drank wine everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;' When I returned to Los Angeles I was lighter than I ever was, and had zero food allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Here in LA I find it beneficial to eat low carb, gluten free and abstain from alcohol if I want to feel good and not gain weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another viewer revealed: 'I noticed the same thing when I was over there. My first two weeks in Europe were in Portugal and that's where I noticed the biggest difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was walking/exploring more. My stress level dropped to NOTHING and my food seemed much healthier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went over with a 31' waist and came back to the US at nearly a 30' waist. My two-liter became a six pack again and I honestly felt 10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had Sangria and Gelato on a regular basis but I just have a feeling that everything was more natural and not full of preservatives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Previous &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7011a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; showed that 1 in 54 8-year-olds had been diagnosed with autism in 2016. In 2000, it was 1 in 150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The most striking piece of this is how unbelievably common  presentations of autism are,” said Zachary Warren, an author of the new report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Warren, also the executive director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD) in Nashville, Tennessee, largely attributed the increases to improvements in detecting the developmental disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors are better than ever at identifying autism, with awareness at an all-time high. “Without a doubt, we’ve become exceptionally efficient in this surveillance work,” Warren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What other factors could be causing the rise in autism? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Answers are both inconclusive and wildly complicated. Potential causes have been scrutinized for decades, and there doesn’t seem to be a single smoking gun. The leading theory lies in genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have pretty compelling data that there are causes of autism, not a single cause,” Warren said. “We may have hundreds, if not 1000s, of different neurogenetic factors that influence presentations of autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite proven research to the contrary, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-autism-summit-age-rfk-jr-rcna200240" target="_blank"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;. has repeatedly suggested that vaccines — specifically the shots that protect against measles, mumps and rubella — are linked to autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;link has been widely debunked&lt;/a&gt;, but continues to contribute to a decline in vaccine uptake across the U.S. — even amid a growing measles outbreak that’s sickened hundreds and killed two young children in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC study also looked at autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds, estimated to be 1 in 34 in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Boys were three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism. Diagnoses were also more common among Black and Hispanic children compared with white children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The disorder appears to be a focus of the Trump administration. Both the president and Kennedy have said it’s critical to find what’s causing autism in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During a meeting at the White House last week, Kennedy said his agency will move forward with a “massive testing and research effort” to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-says-hhs-will-determine-cause-autism-september-rcna200768" target="_blank"&gt;find the cause of autism by September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;It was unclear how the HHS effort would be different from previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPSlhvZlRhd2s0RllEZ3BNajVOMnlPOE9jc1pBQ0NEM2JlSm9xZno4bjB3bVRGRU5zVlRoaE5yTlFMMmV0eXhZRHRDajh5Ui1peDRjMnZ3Sl9HMXpLcWI2SHM3X0hWZXltVlp6dWtxMU9nWGJXSklWZXJ6SXhVUEo5SWZZTGVVY2FHUTUyVGhIZVRhdENKUkJF0gFWQVVfeXFMT2FJWjBfRzZkVXNlQ3NmTjFXU1JHRnZnM2dtMm9vRVJZREV1STIzRHZkWHdObkpmV1NJSnI2S29oZ3BBUnpCNFZ4UmNiT3ZqUWpmSXpyVlE</guid></item><item><title>如果您不喜欢锻炼，这里有一种科学支持的方法可以让您变得更健康-《华盛顿邮报》 | Here’s a science-backed way to get healthier if you don’t like exercise - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPelYxTVlQaHE4cUFna1ZCY3BvMmpEOGRoZlpuV2tfOXpGNC1nQVhDMFhYQWZNcHMxQ0ltdmFSR01Ic2FWb0xySG8xM2tYcDlVcWl0R2tic2l1UW11bTB2VHJpZGJPblJCanpDM2tUWUl6UEx1Q3A5ak1nZVJOeDg0S2hLa3lMLUtMT1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D3KTKIQSZFAYTCDBBKZVOEEDEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re not a fan of working out or simply don’t have time, we’ve got good news for you. Doing everyday chores and activities a bit more briskly might lead to big gains in health and longevity, a new study shows.

None formally exercised. But some moved with more zip than others as they went about their lives, taking the stairs instead of the escalator, for instance, or speed vacuuming their living rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJWXQE5S6FAVRACTR626AWTUVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amounts of these everyday exertions were small, the study found, often less than five minutes a day, but the impacts appeared outsized.

For the past few years, Stamatakis and his colleagues have been using data from the immense UK Biobank to explore that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2NA53PF4NJDELCOLBL6AV62RNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The biobank has enrolled tens of thousands of British adults, who provided health information and tissue samples. Many of them also wore advanced activity trackers for a week, which provided detailed readouts of how they spent almost every moment of their days at work and home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QMNZ3ADGV5EK7E47IODP2TS5QU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In past studies from his lab, Stamatakis and his co-authors analyzed those readouts and related health and death records. They discovered that people who said they never exercised but who often moved around at what scientists call a vigorous pace — meaning they got out of breath as they ran for a bus or sprinted intensely up the stairs — typically developed fewer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467622/" target="_blank"&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x" target="_blank"&gt;lived longer than people&lt;/a&gt; who rarely, if ever, moved vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYWLJIFQAZDYVALAG7SYRSVNLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Stamatakis knew, as an exercise scientist, that a lot of people are intimidated by words like vigorous and intense, in the context of exercise and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FYD4V2Z3FD3ZKONM2JGODDADU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the latest study, he and colleagues decided to see whether gentler forms of everyday activities might also be associated with better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="K364TQKVTZANVMWADBCISXC4F4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="K364TQKVTZANVMWADBCISXC4F4"&gt;Moving in short bursts has greatest benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SKHEGXVUJFEAXPRZQ4UYPAFD44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In simple terms, physical activity can be light, moderate or vigorous, depending on how hard you push yourself. Light-intensity activities feel easy enough that you can chat with someone without puffing and even sing. During moderate activity, you’re still able to talk, a little breathlessly, but not sing. When activity grows vigorous, you can barely speak without gasping, and you certainly can’t sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGVV6SDWZ5HY5N4UUQ6U3LUIBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To conduct their study,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Stamatakis and his colleagues used algorithmic machine learning to closely analyze movement patterns in 10-second increments and determine whether someone was moving lightly, moderately or vigorously. They used biobank tracker records from 24,139 adults who never formally exercised, then cross-checked against hospital and death data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OPFFFEJKAJA5TPPBE7OGUXBNAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What they found was that light everyday activities, which might include strolls to pick up lunch or visit the copier, slightly reduced risks for cardiovascular problems and deaths during the next eight years, compared to people who recorded almost zero activity (meaning they remained seated for almost the entire day). But people needed more than two hours a day of light activity to see much benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5FGGWMDMJG7LOEO4WWWDMUXYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Moderate everyday activity was far more potent. If people spent 24 minutes a day moving around at a moderate pace, their risks of developing or dying from cardiovascular problems dropped by as much as 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRPMO7L76FEBXIY5JFNKE2TLTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the most effective dose of vigorous everyday movement was even lower.

Hurrying up them will be vigorous. Or pick up the pace while you walk, swinging your arms, “which is what we call sprint walking,” he said, “and is moderate. Or garden as fast as you can. There are plenty of opportunities to add a little more exertion” to what you’re going to be doing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z4VWMKHK25HK5PLRQGBAUYKLDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study has limitations, of course. It mostly involved White, educated Brits. It’s also possible that people who move through chores slowly have underlying health problems, predisposing them to heart risks, without any contribution from their daily movements. But the researchers excluded anyone who experienced heart problems in the first year of the study, lessening that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6IZ5KSMNGZEL5E37UOZLLM3YPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps most important, the findings aren’t meant to discourage exercise. “You can do both,” Stamatakis said, exercise and push yourself sometimes as you go about your day, assuming that your health and circumstances allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDV2ZLKCKFHEZCLZ6E7QGNALRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s quite a good study, both the methodology and the message,” said Martin Gibala, an exercise scientist at McMaster University in Canada, who studies exercise intensity but was not involved with this research. The results suggest that, even if you choose not to exercise, sprinkling a little moderate or vigorous everyday activity into your life “can have meaningful health effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPelYxTVlQaHE4cUFna1ZCY3BvMmpEOGRoZlpuV2tfOXpGNC1nQVhDMFhYQWZNcHMxQ0ltdmFSR01Ic2FWb0xySG8xM2tYcDlVcWl0R2tic2l1UW11bTB2VHJpZGJPblJCanpDM2tUWUl6UEx1Q3A5ak1nZVJOeDg0S2hLa3lMLUtMT1E</guid></item><item><title>1岁的麻疹患者可能在7个地点暴露了其他人：英厄姆官员-底特律新闻 | 1-year-old with measles may have exposed others at 7 locations: Ingham officials - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPUkdWYk9mLTJxSHF5cFpueEJxT0stNG83LXFTWWVsQWNCQllmSjFFNVJCYkNubHhiamkyNFVMWno1NU5ZNVctdlhhZTl5UjhHTnE3SnBnZ2pHUk9ZSFM3Yk1yRHJBN25kVE03cTFtQkk2Q2dORDlZbERKWVF6anE5aU1pUGEwU0ZSMkl1M3JvNkJ6bGI0NFM4a2MtUUhuampNYk80NTYxVld0SG9rdHBQbWhtS054eHE1U25hb1dVcVU2YXJZWG9lbGFXT3NoNURhNzdJSEJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health officials on Monday confirmed the state's fifth measles case of the year in a one-year-old girl from Ingham County, who may have exposed others to it at multiple locations during a four-day period, according to the county health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is a very contagious disease spread through person-to-person contact and the air, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The child may have exposed people at seven different locations between April 4 and 8, and the Ingham County Health Department is working to identify and notify them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are closely monitoring this case and taking it very seriously," Dr. Nike Shoyinka, Ingham County Medical Health Officer, said in the news release. "Measles is highly contagious and can lead to severe complications, especially in young children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Possible exposure sites are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Tractor Supply, W Grand River Ave, Lansing, on April 4 between 6 p.m. and 8:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Okemos Farmer’s Market in Meridian Mall, on April 5 between 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Aldi in Okemos, on April 5 between 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Towar Hart Baptist Church in East Lansing on April 6 between 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Toscana Restaurant in Lansing on April 6 between 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Michigan State University Community Music School on April 8 between 5:30 p.m. and 7:35 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;University of Michigan Health Sparrow Lansing Emergency Department on April 8 between 6 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who may have been exposed to measles should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a red rash on the face and rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If symptoms develop, patients should contact their health care provider immediately, the Ingham County Health Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People can contract measles by being in a room where an infected person has also been up to two hours after they left, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is the best protection against the disease, and two doses are roughly 97% effective at preventing measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Children can receive their first dose of the measles vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and their second between the ages of four and six years old. Anyone who is not vaccinated is at risk for serious health complications from measles, especially children below the age of five, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ingham County Health Department encouraged everyone to check their vaccination status and is providing doses at its immunization clinic in Lansing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The MMR vaccine is safe, effective, and remains our best defense. Two doses provide 97%protection," Shoyinka said in the news release.

Animal control was called, but was unable to find that raccoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on April 9, another resident had an altercation with a raccoon while walking, officials said. Animal control was able to pick up the raccoon and send it for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, it was confirmed by the state Department of Health and Human Services that the raccoon tested positive for rabies, the Camden County Health Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal control officer, dog owner and the resident on a walk were all notified. The Camden County Department of Health and Human Services received proof of vaccination for the dog, it received a rabies booster shot and will be under confinement and observation for 45 days, officials said. All potentially exposed residents have started to receive post-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PEP) for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although rabies is a serious illness, it can be prevented by early treatment,” said Commissioner Virginia Betteridge, liaison to the Camden County Health Department. “If you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal it is important that you seek immediate medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betteridge urged county residents to observe a few simple rules, including acting responsibly as a pet owner: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep vaccinations up to date for all dogs, cats, and ferrets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets under direct supervision so they do not come in contact with wild animals. If your pet is bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact your local animal control agency to remove any stray animals from your neighborhood. They may be unvaccinated and could be infected by the disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Betteridge said it is also important to avoid direct contact with unfamiliar animals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 16:03:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPV1BHWmowdFdYdkdEMWVTbFlRXzI5NG85a1VHR0ZpRDhkc0h6LUI0REpiOVpjdFA2NXZYSjFDdENZc0pvcmJvM3pFeVhtek5hckRFd3VLLW45enV0V3M4enVOckxHS09sbnEzV2hhUUVOUHRBb3JTZEdJVHR6ZFQ3RC1pNmJaRHhmTXpmOTZJYkI4eVRkTnpWQ1VLd3laWkU5ekM0d9IBugFBVV95cUxNRUZsZTRiWm9jU3BWQm1iMmxCZFpUMmE5UTNoZ1VlLXhkUndHNlk2VU0wcXNOamU5MHY4ZG82ckpzMENPMnJCRkZuTFVzVWJmWldMMEp3WWdfMThBT0lNYklKcy1LVmZ3VTJKakxQeEZmdWpvcU0zaC1TQ1lKUGpNQk9ienhGRkxleDJTdmt4eFlITV9MMjNlZDljcC0zcUVkMXpELWUyX3llZmxMdFZEREp6bktPN0dFMGc</guid></item><item><title>我们即将推出通用过敏疗法--Vox | We’re on the verge of a universal allergy cure - Vox</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNTFFvMzZaSnBsSDZOX05wOWhHSEt2WWVQNmN4eDJyVkRIZVBPZWNuYVV6QUtXRFhxdU9pbnRfcTIwYldIcllJeXNWczBuVnVKUUFqeHJsRnFraEhIMzQ3OU5FU2lmQjdRWmwyd1lyNTFFVGROaUZGQXFhTzFlQl9UUEln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrixz"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you’re bothered by allergies every spring, you may pop a Benadryl or Claritin most mornings to make the days tolerable. Two-thirds of Americans &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/a-growing-number-of-americans-consider-medications-for-springtime-allergy-relief/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; spring allergies, and about 4 in 10 say they take an allergy medication several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But those medicines, while valuable, don’t exactly fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00237.x"&gt;One 2001 study&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom found 60 percent of people who took some kind of over-the-counter medication for allergies reported they were not satisfied with how it managed their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nasal sprays are not exactly enjoyable or easy to operate. Allergy medicines have to be taken every day if you deal with serious hay fever, and they can produce, ironically, tiredness for some people during this season of renewal. A missed dose can lead to a day of hacking and sneezing. Oh, and the more you take them, the less likely they are to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A century ago, antihistamines were a revolution in allergy treatment. But now, we’re on the cusp of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Omalizumab, sold as Xolair, is an asthma medication that was approved more than 20 years ago, but it has proven successful in treating seasonal allergies in recent preliminary trials. So successful, in fact, that now some doctors in the US are prescribing it for certain patients during hay fever season. It is an injection, rather than a pill or a spray, that’s given a couple of weeks before pollen and grass levels start to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One obvious benefit is you get a single shot and enjoy your spring. But even better, omalizumab can forestall allergic reactions at the source. That means an injection could stop &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; allergic reactions — not only seasonal allergies but &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt; (such as peanuts) and insect allergies for a prolonged period of time. This class of treatment — monoclonal antibodies, special artificial proteins that carry instructions to the body’s immune system — have the potential to be a genuine all-in-one allergy wonder drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The biggest advantage of antibody-based therapeutics is that they offer the potential to target the underlying pathways driving allergic reactions in general,” said Sayantani Sindher, a clinical associate professor at Stanford University’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research. “This means antibody-based therapies will simultaneously impact all of the patient’s allergens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Large clinical trials are underway in China and Japan, which could lead to omalizumab’s approval in those countries for seasonal allergies. The next generation of monoclonal antibody allergy treatments is already in the works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-monoclonal-antibodies-could-stop-allergy-season-before-it-starts" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How monoclonal antibodies could stop allergy season before it starts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the United States, the use of monoclonal antibodies started with doctors studying and prescribing preexisting treatments “off label” — meaning these are drugs that were actually developed for something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Asthma and seasonal allergies often occur in tandem, which made omalizumab an obvious candidate for a new approach to allergy treatment. The drug had also separately proven effective in treating food allergies, adding to evidence that it had the right properties to stop seasonal allergies at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The treatment has demonstrated significantly better outcomes than antihistamines in small randomized trials, requiring only one dose two weeks before pollen and grass season. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clt2.12094"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; reported that patients who received a 300 mg injection of Xolair experienced fewer symptoms and fewer days that required a daily antihistamine or other medication; the patients also reported a better quality of life during the allergy season. Their symptoms were particularly improved during the worst pollen days when compared to the people who only took a daily medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When pollen and other allergens emerge every year and enter your body through your eyes, ears, or nose while you’re enjoying the crisp spring air, your body’s immune system overreacts. Immunoglobulin, proteins that are supposed to identify and attack parasites or a virus, instead go after the otherwise harmless allergen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the immunoglobulin attacks the allergen, your body releases histamine, a chemical critical to inflammation (which, again, is really important when you are actually exposed to a dangerous parasite or virus). That inflammation then creates all that mucus and sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Monoclonal antibodies stop that process before it begins.

Those shots as well as oral tablets that work in the same way function differently: They expose people to small amounts of the actual allergen, giving their bodies a chance to develop natural immunity to it. They can unlock more durable resistance to specific allergies — but they can only treat one allergy at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You may also need to go to the doctor once a week for a month or longer during the initial treatment course.

There is a subset of people for whom antihistamines don’t work, including those who have built up a tolerance to those drugs after frequent usage. These new monoclonal antibodies may help them where those old treatments are now failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Specially tailored allergy-specific products are now in the works, ushering in this new era of allergy treatment. In early April, the final stage of one clinical trial found the following results after four weeks: Patients who had still reported symptoms after taking the standard-of-care treatment and then received a monoclonal antibody injection were much more likely to report mild or no nasal symptoms (62 percent) than people who were taking the placebo (39 percent). They scored significantly better on oral symptoms and other measures of efficacy without serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The drug in the clinical trial, Stapokibart, was recently &lt;a href="https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5945250"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; for seasonal allergy treatment in China, and its developer, Keymed, has &lt;a href="https://endpts.com/how-keymed-steered-the-china-to-us-newco-model-in-biotech/#:~:text=Keymed%20Biosciences%20is%20a%20prime,four%20NewCo%20deals%20since%20July."&gt;premised its business&lt;/a&gt; on developing and gaining approval for treatments in that country and then bringing them to the US.

So far, doctors have been prescribing this “off label” — meaning it has proven safe to use for a different purpose, but the science on its effectiveness for allergies is preliminary. A prescription is ultimately at your doctor’s discretion, but if you suffer from severe allergies, it could be a fit for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here are some things to consider asking your physician if you’re interested in this kind of treatment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Are there other existing treatments they would advise trying first?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Do I have another condition for which Xolair is intended to treat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What steps should we take for my health plan to cover the cost?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With antihistamines and nasal sprays, you must regularly buy them yourself and repeatedly remember to take them correctly to stave off allergy symptoms. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00237.x"&gt;That 2001 study in the UK&lt;/a&gt; found that many people who suffered seasonal allergy symptoms nonetheless did a poor job of taking medication as they should: Among the 54 percent of people who were experiencing poor allergy symptoms, 70 percent didn’t use the conventional allergy medicines according to the clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But for allergy sufferers to make the jump from something like Claritin to an annual allergy shot that works even better, health insurance coverage will be critical: The list price on omalizumab is &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/xolair"&gt;$1,500 a pop&lt;/a&gt;. This would be a new cost to health plans because patients often bear their own over-the-counter antihistamine med costs. Off-label coverage of any drug, including omalizumab for seasonal allergies, can be fickle. Some popular plans, such as United Healthcare, &lt;a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/xolair-omalizumab.pdf"&gt;are not currently covering&lt;/a&gt; the drug for that use at this time because they consider it unproven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As more research comes in and more products come on the market, the insurers’ value proposition may change. The FDA recently &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-fda-approves-celltrions-omlyclo-omalizumab-igec-as-the-first-and-only-biosimilar-with-interchangeability-designation-referencing-xolair-302396468.html"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; a generic version of omalizumab, which should help reduce prices for that injection. As they do, they could offer more value for the patients for whom conventional therapies aren’t working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Seasonal allergies can significantly diminish a person’s quality of life — during what should be one of the most enjoyable times on the calendar — and they come around every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;The work to provide all-in-one allergy relief isn’t finished yet.

Some experts think this interaction warrants closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was co-authored by Tan Ma from &lt;a href="http://www.rcees.ac.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Beijing Environmental Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, who has examined how these substances disrupt important cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-plastic-exposure"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tracing plastic exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People encounter &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-pose-a-greater-threat-to-some-ocean-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; in items like synthetic fabrics or disposable packaging. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; are even smaller and can remain hidden in many everyday settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have spotted them in water sources and even in common household dust. The concern is that humans might accumulate them across decades with unknown consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-premature-aging"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Signs of premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b00423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; propose that ongoing contact with these particles can stir up harmful cell processes, including persistent inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/even-mild-inflammation-can-majorly-damage-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; often appears as people age, which might speed up natural aging. This emerging &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-024-05731-5"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; has many scientists asking if these plastics add extra stress at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/damaged-mitochondria-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; help power daily functions by creating energy for cells. They also help process byproducts that might damage tissues if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts see these organelles as a key indicator of healthy aging. Interference in their normal operations may link to conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-and-premature-aging"&gt;Microplastics and premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; that small plastic bits can enter cells through multiple pathways. Once they get inside, they might shift how cells manage waste or handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disturbance can weaken some of the checkpoints that keep cells balanced. If mitochondria lose efficiency, the body might face a higher load of problems related to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that they are there and are transported throughout the body, but we don’t know yet if they can cross the blood-brain barrier,” said Dr. Sherri Mason, a noted researcher on microplastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about how these particles gather in the body are driving new studies. Lab tests aim to see how these fragments move through different organs throughout a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specialists think that data will help regulators set safer standards for plastic production. Others emphasize personal measures, like filtered water, to lower daily exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oxidative-stress-from-foreign-particles"&gt;Oxidative stress from foreign particles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advanced years, certain disorders may accelerate if &lt;a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-microbiology/chapter/cellular-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular defenses&lt;/a&gt; falter. Scientists have linked these mini-plastics to changes often found in cardiovascular or neurological ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; can emerge when foreign particles disrupt normal metabolic cycles. That stress might make the aging process even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental agencies may reconsider plastic guidelines in light of these findings. Calls for improved waste management reflect a broader move toward reducing pollution at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers propose stricter rules for single-use products. They also suggest more robust screening of manufacturing methods to cut back on plastic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avoiding-microplastics-and-premature-aging"&gt;Avoiding microplastics and premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain people might opt for reusable items to minimize exposure. Others explore technologies that trap or break down plastic waste before it enters the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point out that these moves could help until more significant policy shifts take hold. Public awareness remains a big part of sparking any meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-influence-of-microplastics-on-aging"&gt;Influence of microplastics on aging &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field is evolving, so scientists still lack a complete picture of how microplastics might trigger &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-cause-premature-aging-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;premature aging&lt;/a&gt;. Ongoing trials could reveal whether there is a direct cause and effect with early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful studies will quantify how different doses affect cells over time. Findings might also identify groups most at risk for higher accumulations of these plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This attention to small plastic debris reflects rising worries about synthetic waste in society. Public health experts want to see if new tests can clarify whether such particles directly influence advanced age ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-research-is-needed"&gt;Further research is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many labs are joining forces to track the pathways of these materials. This wave of collaboration may give us a broader sense of how plastics connect with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aging-hotspot-found-in-the-brain-may-hold-the-key-to-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With older populations growing worldwide, it is vital to understand everything that might influence later stages of life. Researchers suggest that these tiny particles deserve more scrutiny for the sake of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing work will aim to uncover any hidden risks or unexpected benefits that come from our frequent use of plastics. The future of aging research may hinge on how we handle these discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152500122X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; point to a connection between these materials and shifts in cellular energy production. These findings highlight how damaged mitochondria may ramp up age-linked health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who monitor &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ocean-plastic-pollution-has-become-a-global-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; say safer disposal methods and product alternatives might be ways to cut down on microscopic fragments. Taking small protective steps could be wise until deeper studies clarify the exact dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027869152500122X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food and Chemical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:41:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQU184Vks5aTBaTEltZm9CYl84cndzWHFZUU1pX0hER3I1eUlkMUMxZmtIZEp0MkpMdjJ6UUFnQUNaTm5CaDlVWHgyYjVUWHhZclI1c2VGMzU2Q3NsYlFSdXdRZlpvRVNlQ1JicW1NUGVhRE40MWVydkxuSVQ2cWRaZG5hR0d0VG0wUFZNWkM4OFE</guid></item><item><title>“食肉”外阴感染呈上升趋势，医生警告- Gizmodo | ‘Flesh-Eating’ Infections of the Vulva Are on the Rise, Doctors Warn - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVUo0VlNVZk9HcXgtWWRpcERxQi0tbzlFenJkbXNXOTVrRkpyTjZDNVZrUl9KVEJVdlhMUnQ0YzNFVE5vN0Ffejl0UDBsMml6bXg4QzNmVmxxbU02S204WDhrclNVdmVaR0lmd0RvMklvdXZCQkRWSWltY1hyclEyRm5wUHZzN3hGT0FxcnlQSl9lN0lmYW03OEZGcDE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A rare but horrific kind of infection might be on the rise. Gynecologists in the UK have begun to see an alarming increase in people with necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva, a.k.a. the “flesh-eating” disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust detailed three such cases in a paper &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/18/4/e263792"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in BMJ Case Reports. All three women were hospitalized, and one died as a result. These cases are part of a growing trend in the UK, the doctors say, and infections that can cause necrotizing fasciitis are increasing in the U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23103-necrotizing-fasciitis"&gt;Necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; is a serious type of bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues underneath our skin (particularly fascia, hence the name). While the appearance of this infection might resemble freshly-chewed flesh, the bacteria aren’t actually eating it away. Once this destruction starts, it can rapidly spread and trigger other life-threatening complications like sepsis. People can die from necrotizing fasciitis in &lt;a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-disease#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20very%20severe,a%20minor%20cut%20or%20bruise."&gt;as little as 12 hours&lt;/a&gt; after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are several different species of bacteria that can potentially cause necrotizing fasciitis, it remains a rare occurrence overall. But the report authors say they’ve noticed a significant uptick lately in cases involving the vulva (the external parts of the female genitalia) at their hospital, which includes the three described in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In two of the cases, the women were diagnosed with vulvar necrotizing fasciitis in the emergency room. In the third, the woman developed it as a complication from an infected surgical wound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One woman had seen a doctor five days earlier after noticing a spot on her mons pubis, and was prescribed antibiotics. But the treatment failed to clear the infection, and by the time she was hospitalized, the infection had spread throughout her labia majora, lower abdomen, and left hip. Despite surgical removal of her infected and necrotic tissue (also known as debridement) and intensive care support, the woman died of sepsis just 28 hours after her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other two women survived their ordeal, though not without serious difficulty. Both needed “extensive surgical debridement” and one woman underwent three separate surgeries to remove tissue, which later required reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These cases are only part of a worrying pattern that the doctors have noticed. They identified 20 cases treated at their hospital between 2022 and 2024, compared to 18 reported in the entire previous decade. And they’re not the only ones spotting an overall rise in “flesh-eating” infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, for instance, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832277"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the rate of invasive group A &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus &lt;/em&gt;(GAS) infections—the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/about/necrotizing-fasciitis.html#:~:text=Experts%20believe%20group%20A%20Streptococcus%20(group%20A%20strep%20bacteria)%20are%20the%20most%20common%20cause"&gt;most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;—had more than doubled in the U.S. between 2013 and 2022. Several countries in Europe, including the UK, have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/12-12-2022-increase-in-invasive-group-a-streptococcal-infections-among-children-in-europe--including-fatalities#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20European%20countries,under%2010%20years%20of%20age."&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; a recent increase in GAS infections.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though necrotizing fasciitis remains rare in general, the doctors hope their report can help alert other ob-gyns to the possibility of these cases, particularly since speedy medical care is needed to prevent death. “With our review of three cases, we aim to raise awareness of this condition among gynecologists, who have limited familiarity with it,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These infections can be fatal anywhere they start, but vulvar necrotizing fasciitis is especially deadly, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25"&gt;a mortality rate as high as 50%&lt;/a&gt; without timely treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invisible chemicals rising from children’s mattresses may be harming their brains and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5c03560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pair of studies published Tuesday,&lt;/a&gt; which found troubling levels of plastic-like “phthalate” chemicals and flame retardants in the bedrooms of children under 4.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Parents should be able to lay their children down for sleep knowing they are safe and snug,” co-author Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there are some steps that parents can take to help keep their kids safe, the problem is pervasive, researchers argued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Canadian scientists found that the weight and temperature of the sleeping child helped create a plume of trace chemicals that filled the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These chemicals can harm the nervous and reproductive system. They also mimic and interfere with systems of hormones, or chemical messengers that help control virtually all bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of Toronto argued that much of the responsibility lies with manufacturers and policymakers. Decades-long campaigns have sought to ban phthalates and plasticizers in children’s toys and furniture, with limited success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even where these efforts have been successful, manufacturers don’t always follow them, and government regulators often don’t enforce them. Tuesday’s study found several mattresses containing chemicals that were banned in Canada — suggesting manufacturers weren’t testing for compounds known to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This controversy is particularly fierce around flame retardants, which Blum noted “have a long history of harming our children’s cognitive function and ability to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar chemicals are required by law in the interior of cars — where a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4649281-chemicals-car-interiors-cancer-required-federal-law-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2024 study found&lt;/a&gt; that they increased cancer risks for tens of millions of commuters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those requirements remain despite repeated findings that so-called flame retardants do little to slow the spread of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They do, however, make those fires “smokier and more toxic,” as a spokesperson from the International Association of Fire Fighters said last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mattresses across North America may pose a similar threat, Tuesday’s findings found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite some benefits in reducing flammability, federal research from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has found flame retardant chemicals cause &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/flame_retardants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;widespread, insidious harms&lt;/a&gt; as they slough off mattresses and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23154064/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;These include links to&lt;/a&gt; impaired attention, cognition and fine motor skills in school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for phthalates, which are used to make plastic-derived compounds more supple, researchers have found that there &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4491881-for-thousands-of-common-chemicals-there-is-no-safe-level-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;may be no safe level of exposure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phthalates alone caused nearly $70 billion in added health costs just in 2018, a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/4401535-plastics-pollution-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2024 study found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Copious research has found that exposure to phthalates and flame retardants is harmful to people of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the NIEHS notes that the risk is particularly stark for children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because children breathe up to 10 times faster than adults — allowing them to take in far more airborne contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Their skin is also more permeable to toxins than adults’ skin, and they frequently put potentially toxic objects from their homes into their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Tuesday’s findings, scientists focused on manufacturers and North American governments, which they said had to do more to ban dangerous plasticizers and flame retardants from mattresses and toys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are some things that parents and caregivers can do, they said. First, wash and change a child’s sheets and blankets frequently, because these offer the best shield against the mattress.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Second, they continued, declutter the sleeping area by removing excess blankets and toys — which are likely sources of contamination themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, they advised avoiding bright-colored sheets and blankets, which often include chemicals meant to block the assault of ultraviolet light — compounds that pose an additional threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the researchers emphasized that this was not a problem parents could solve for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study is “a wake-up call for manufacturers and policymakers to ensure our children’s beds are safe,” co-author Miriam Diamond of the University of Toronto said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking to turn up the heat in the bedroom? The answer may be hiding in your supplement cabinet. Many factors can affect your sex drive, from increased stress and changing relationship dynamics to hormonal changes and medications. However, certain supplements may help boost libido and support sexual health—just make sure to talk with a healthcare provider before trying them. We spoke with health experts to find out the four supplements to consider taking for an increased sex drive, plus other practical tips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Vitamin D  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its role in bone health, but you may be surprised to learn that this sunshine vitamin may also be beneficial for sex. “This fat-soluble vitamin may improve testosterone levels and overall sexual function, especially in individuals who are deficient,” says &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;From Burnout to Balance&lt;/em&gt; and founder of Wellness Intelligence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s estimated that up to 40% of Americans aren’t getting enough vitamin D daily, and having low levels of vitamin D is linked with reduced libido in both men and women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While research is ongoing, if you’re falling short of meeting your daily needs, taking a vitamin D supplement may help restore energy and drive in the bedroom. &lt;a href="https://www.peakperformanceandlongevity.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Zamora, FNP&lt;/a&gt;, a family nurse practitioner and a sexual wellness clinician, agrees, saying, “I usually start with vitamin D and thyroid support for energy, mood and libido.” She also recommends getting a morning dose of sunlight for a natural boost of vitamin D.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-ashwagandha"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Ashwagandha  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ashwagandha-benefits-8668370" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; is an adaptogenic herb that may help calm your mind so you can be fully present during intimate moments. “It helps reduce stress by lowering cortisol levels, which may improve sexual desire and performance,” says Bannan. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oftentimes the issue isn’t blood flow when it comes to sexual function—it’s that your mind is racing. You’re thinking about the dishes in the sink, the next day’s to-do list or whether the laundry’s still in the dryer,” adds Zamora&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;She adds that this herb may “help calm your nervous system, so you can slow down and actually feel the pleasure.” Research seems to agree, with studies finding ashwagandha supplements to be effective for reducing stress and anxiety and improving sexual health and function in both men and women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Evidence also suggests that the herb may have a promising role in thyroid support, another important part of sexual health, though more studies are needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just keep in mind that ashwagandha isn’t safe for everyone, including those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, have certain medical conditions or are taking certain prescription medications. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-nicotinamide-riboside-nr"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re lacking stamina in the bedroom, nicotinamide riboside (NR) might give you the energy boost you need. NR is a form of vitamin B3 (niacin) that gets converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-a-nad-supplement-8719092" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; is a compound that converts food into energy and supports DNA repair to combat damage from everyday stressors. “When it comes to libido and reproductive health, supporting NAD+ is essential for both women and men,” says &lt;a href="https://www.draimee.org/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Aimee Eyvazzadeh, MD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified OBGYN and fertility doctor known as The Egg Whisperer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; NAD+ naturally dips as we age, potentially bringing your sex drive down with it. Research suggests that NR supplements may raise NAD+ levels significantly, which may help rev up stamina and desire, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-l-arginine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. L-Arginine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want to get your blood pumping in all the right ways? “L-arginine enhances blood flow by increasing nitric oxide production, beneficial for both arousal and maintaining sexual function,” says Bannan. Studies suggest that taking L-arginine supplements may enhance arousal and sensitivity in women and improve erectile function in men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Short-term use is generally well-tolerated, though L-arginine supplements may cause gastrointestinal side effects like bloating or nausea. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-things-to-consider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Things to Consider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When shopping for supplements, look for reputable brands that are third-party tested to ensure label accuracy. Unless recommended otherwise by a healthcare professional, Bannan recommends starting “with the lowest possible dose to assess your body’s response.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also important to talk with a healthcare provider before taking any new supplements, especially if you have an underlying health condition or are taking medications, to ensure the product is safe and aligns with your health needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zamora recommends addressing common culprits of a lowered sex drive before reaching for supplements: Sleep, stress, nutrition, exercise and communication. “Those five things alone are incredibly powerful. Without that foundation, no pill is going to fix what’s missing in the relationship or the body,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get adequate rest:&lt;/strong&gt; “Sleep is essential for reducing stress and fatigue, which can negatively impact sexual performance,” says Bannan. Aim for 7–8 hours of quality sleep per night. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management: &lt;/strong&gt;There are many ways to help manage stress levels throughout the day, including yoga, meditation, deep breathing or journaling. Find one or two techniques that you can stay consistent with. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity can increase stamina, improve body image, boost libido and may lead to better sex.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is lubrication:&lt;/strong&gt; Open communication allows partners to share their thoughts, feelings, and needs, which can lead to better understanding and intimacy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a healthy diet: &lt;/strong&gt;To support energy levels for a better sex life, Bannan and Zamora recommend eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and lean proteins. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements won’t make or break your sex life, but they may help you get back to a thriving sexual relationship. Depending on your diet and needs, taking a vitamin D, ashwagandha, nicotinamide riboside or L-arginine supplement may positively affect your libido. Of course, results ultimately depend on the bigger picture—after all, the right supplements may give your sex drive a boost, but the real magic happens when you pair them with an overall healthy lifestyle and open communication. Before adding any of these supplements to your shopping cart, talk with a healthcare professional to ensure a product is safe and aligns with your health needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent groundbreaking study has revealed an astonishing natural event: &lt;strong&gt;terrestrial animals&lt;/strong&gt; that managed to journey across the &lt;strong&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;, covering an immense &lt;strong&gt;8,000 kilometers&lt;/strong&gt;, to settle on a new continent. This remarkable feat is considered one of the longest &lt;strong&gt;transoceanic migrations&lt;/strong&gt; ever undertaken by a &lt;strong&gt;vertebrate animal&lt;/strong&gt;, with the exception of those carried by &lt;strong&gt;humans&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318622122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the animals involved in this extraordinary migration now inhabit the &lt;strong&gt;islands of Fiji&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, these creatures share a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/first-ever-pig-liver-successfully-transplanted-into-human-body-a-revolution-in-transplant-science/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="84198" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetic link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with animals found in the &lt;strong&gt;Americas&lt;/strong&gt;, raising questions about how they managed to travel such a vast distance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous theories proposed that the animals might have reached these distant lands through ancient &lt;strong&gt;land bridges&lt;/strong&gt; that existed millions of years ago. However, this new study suggests an entirely different possibility: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/largest-ever-great-white-shark-atlantic/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83490" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maritime migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;Cyclones&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Currents&lt;/strong&gt; Helped Animals Travel Across the &lt;strong&gt;Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings present an unexpected explanation for how these animals managed their transoceanic voyage. &lt;strong&gt;Simon Scarpetta&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;strong&gt;evolutionary biologist&lt;/strong&gt; and lead researcher of the study, suggests that the animals didn’t actively choose to embark on such a long journey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, they were most likely swept away by a &lt;strong&gt;cyclone&lt;/strong&gt; that overturned the trees where they lived. These trees, caught in &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/earths-most-powerful-ocean-current-is-dying-and-no-one-is-ready/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81434" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;powerful ocean currents&lt;/a&gt;, acted as rafts, carrying the animals across the Pacific Ocean to their new home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scarpetta points out that the journey was not a matter of mere survival, as these animals, including &lt;strong&gt;prehistoric iguanas&lt;/strong&gt;, have long been known for their ability to&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/scientists-discover-thousands-of-giant-living-eggs-in-an-underwater-volcano/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83783" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; survive harsh environments&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures can endure extreme famine and dehydration, which would have been essential for surviving the long oceanic crossing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The floating trees would have also provided much-needed sustenance, as the animals could feed on the vegetation that floated alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prehistoric Iguanas&lt;/strong&gt;: Survivors of the &lt;strong&gt;Harshest Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The animals at the center of this remarkable story are &lt;strong&gt;prehistoric iguanas&lt;/strong&gt;, herbivores that originally lived in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/mysterious-wild-cat-caught-arizona-desert/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7550" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;desert environments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Known for their incredible resilience, these creatures can survive for long periods without food and water—traits that would have been indispensable for their survival during such an arduous journey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Scarpetta, these iguanas’ ability to withstand prolonged periods of dehydration and hunger would have been key to enduring the oceanic voyage. Remarkably, these prehistoric iguanas are genetically related to species in the &lt;strong&gt;Americas&lt;/strong&gt;, adding more intrigue to their extraordinary migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As they were transported across the ocean by floating vegetation, the iguanas likely used the time on the rafts to nourish themselves and conserve their energy, allowing them to survive the lengthy journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Record-Breaking Journey&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to Other Animal Migrations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the iguanas’ oceanic journey is certainly impressive, it is not the first time that animals have migrated across large bodies of water. More than &lt;strong&gt;36 million years ago&lt;/strong&gt;, primates from &lt;strong&gt;Africa&lt;/strong&gt; crossed the &lt;strong&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;, a distance of approximately 1,000 kilometers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the distance covered by the prehistoric iguanas far exceeds this earlier migration, making it the longest known &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/humpback-whale-sets-record-for-longest-migration-ever-is-this-journey-a-warning-sign-for-ocean-chaos/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73519" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;transoceanic animal migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to date. This comparison underscores the sheer magnitude of the iguanas’ journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Unlike the primates, who may have had assistance from floating vegetation, the iguanas’ journey demonstrates their unique ability to survive and thrive in the harsh conditions of the open ocean, far from their native land.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Stopping to smell the roses is one thing. But dawdling through life could come with added health risks, according to new research. Researchers analyzed the daily movements of more than 24,000 adults who did not formally exercise over the course of a week, finding those who made small exertions—vacuuming with speed or taking the stairs instead of the escalator—were as much as half as likely to experience a heart attack or stroke in subsequent years as those who moved slowly, per the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/15/get-healthier-without-exercise/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The study, published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072253"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests "it's a good idea to find ways to fit exertion into your daily life," study author Emmanuel Stamatakis, an exercise scientist at the University of Sydney, tells the outlet.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        His past research found people who don't formally exercise but move at a vigorous pace, to the point of getting out of the breath, live longer and have fewer serious diseases than people who move more slowly. For this study, Stamatakis and colleagues analyzed records from 24,139 adults who wore fitness trackers, none of whom exercised regularly. People who engaged in two hours of light daily activities, like a walk, had slightly reduced risks for cardiovascular issues and deaths over the next eight years compared to those who recorded almost no activity, while people who moved at a moderate pace for at least 24 minutes a day had up to a 50% lower risk of cardiovascular issues and deaths.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Those who engaged in incidental activity of vigorous intensity for just over five minutes per day, meanwhile, were up to 38% less likely to suffer a serious heart event or death, per the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/this-is-the-least-you-need-to-do-to-reduce-your-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-20250403-p5lotj.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Though it could be that those who move slowly are hindered by health problems that leave them predisposed to heart risks, Stamatakis says there's an opportunity here for people to hurry up daily tasks, like gardening or walking up stairs, to push them into the moderate or vigorous category, adding more exertion and potentially lowering health risks without having to set foot in a gym. While structured exercise is "far superior" for health and fitness, a bit of huffing and puffing can still provide meaningful benefits, Stamatakis tells the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;.

Researchers targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—key in planning and action—while participants performed simultaneous visual and auditory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anodal stimulation, which enhances brain activity, led to quicker decisions, while cathodal stimulation, which suppresses activity, made participants stick to previous choices. Though subtle, these results suggest tDCS may modulate cognitive flexibility under specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Brain Area:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulation focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which regulates planning and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Anodal stimulation sped up task choices, while cathodal stimulation reduced adaptability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes were subtle (~100ms) but statistically significant in experimental psychology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simple method of brain stimulation has been shown to change how people make decisions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These were the findings of a new study by the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), which was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation used transcranial direct current stimulation, which is an established method in research and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108766"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study found that with anodal stimulation, which increased the activity in the region of the brain, the participants needed less time overall to choose the task; in other words, the decision was made more quickly. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In transcranial direct current stimulation, a very weak electric current flows through electrodes that have been placed on the scalp. This can be used to activate or inhibit specific regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anodal stimulation, a positive electrode is applied, which increases the activity of the nerve cells. In contrast, cathodal stimulation uses a negative electrode and inhibits activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The method has great advantages as it is non-invasive and very easy to use. This is why it is widely utilised in psychology,” says Dr Sebastian Kübler, a psychologist at MLU. Its potential use in treating neurological and mental disorders is also being intensively investigated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists at MLU are studying whether direct current stimulation influences how people make decisions. In the study, which included 40 study participants, a specific region of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The region is crucial for planning and weighing up actions,” explains Torsten Schubert, a professor at the Institute of Psychology at MLU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had to complete two tasks at the same time – an auditory and a visual task – and had to decide which one they would solve first. The test subjects wore the electrodes throughout the entire experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at the time of the study, neither they nor the researchers knew what type of stimulation was being used or whether any current was flowing at all. The experiments were repeated at intervals of at least one week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that with anodal stimulation, which increased the activity in the region of the brain, the participants needed less time overall to choose the task; in other words, the decision was made more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cathodal stimulation was applied, which inhibits brain activity, participants tended to stick with a previously chosen order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that an activated or inhibited dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increases or reduces cognitive flexibility when people have to perform several tasks simultaneously,” says Sebastian Kübler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was found to be in the range of around 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This seems small at first, but in experimental psychology it is a relevant change. It appears that transcranial direct current stimulation changes a person’s ability to decide which action to take,” explains Torsten Schubert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devices that use transcranial direct current stimulation are now even being sold commercially and are touted as being able to increase creativity and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such sweeping promises are not credible. However, our study does show that the method can, under controlled conditions, influence cognitive processes such as decision-making. It should also be noted that the effects are very subtle and depend on many factors,” says Kübler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain stimulation and decision-making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e3a212360222b2120262f3c2a3a0e3c2b253a213c2f3a603b202763262f22222b602a2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tom Leonhardt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-halle.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tom Leonhardt – Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_02270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Voluntary Task-order Coordination in Dual-task Situations&lt;/a&gt;” by Sebastian Kübler et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Voluntary Task-order Coordination in Dual-task Situations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual tasks (DTs) require additional control processes that temporally coordinate the processing of the two component tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies employing imaging as well as noninvasive stimulation techniques have demonstrated that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is causally involved in these task-order coordination processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in these studies, participants were instructed to match their processing order to an externally provided and mandatory order criterion during DT processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is still unknown whether the dlPFC is also recruited for rather voluntary order control processes, which are required in situations that allow for intentional and internally generated order choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, in two experiments, we applied anodal (Experiment 1) and cathodal (Experiment 2) transcranial direct current stimulation during a random-order DT in which participants could freely decide about their order of task processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our results, we found facilitatory and inhibitory effects on voluntary task-order coordination because of anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was indicated by shorter RTs when participants intentionally switched the task order relative to the preceding trial during anodal as well as a reduced tendency to switch the task order relative to the preceding trial during cathodal stimulation compared with the sham stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings indicate that the dlPFC is also causally involved in voluntary task-order coordination processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we argue that the dlPFC is recruited for intentionally updating and implementing task-order information that is necessary for scheduling the processing of two temporally overlapping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:58:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE93VXJieG9WNG9zZHRXNWY1WVozaUgxa0lPOHNxNkE0Yjc5SzRTbVpwdXg1SnBIMUY5WDAtamlyTTQxMGdDa29GU2l3ck9DeDdwcVBHSS1GRU1Fc2JhenhDYTlQYmlUUERmbjZnaGxoNmxpZlhVTmJIanpYRVB5dlk</guid></item><item><title>触摸处理在自闭症中的不同之处及其重要性-神经科学新闻 | How Touch Processing Differs in Autism and Why It Matters - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpNks0YnlIbzNodWNjWU1DV2JYWjRZR0dob0N5U3JxZlpMMGRQTnlhYm5XVy1IV1hnb3duMUV0eTR3czQwM3Q2Z2xPc004M0FoaVdkM2F4QU1TTXlLWFZGLXNoWDYwakFuZUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that adults with autism process active and passive touch similarly, unlike neurotypical individuals whose brains reduce activity during self-initiated touch. This finding may help explain repetitive behaviors like stimming, which are common in autism and can serve as emotional regulation or sensory coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG, virtual reality, and vibrotactile input, researchers created a realistic experimental setup to simulate touch and track brain responses. The study opens the door to understanding how sensory input impacts behavior and could inform future interventions to reduce harmful self-stimulation in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Perception Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with autism showed similar brain responses to both active and passive touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Prediction Deficit:&lt;/strong&gt; This may indicate difficulty in predicting sensory outcomes, which could underlie stimming behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Method:&lt;/strong&gt; The study combined EEG, virtual reality, and tactile simulation for realistic and rigorous sensory testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapping a pen, shaking a leg, twirling hair—we have all been in a classroom, meeting, or a public place where we find ourselves or someone else engaging in repetitive behavior—a type of self-stimulatory movement also known as stimming. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with autism, stimming can include movements like flicking fingers or rocking back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108762"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child touching a wall." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To measure active touch, participants reached out to touch a virtual hand, giving them control over when they would feel the vibrations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These actions are believed to be used to deal with overwhelming sensory environments, regulate emotions, or express joy, but stimming is not well understood. And while the behaviors are mostly harmless and, in some instances, beneficial, stimming can also escalate and cause serious injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is a difficult behavior to study, especially when the behaviors involve self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more we learn about how benign active tactile sensations like stimming are processed, the closer we will be to understanding self-injurious behavior,” said Emily Isenstein, PhD (’24), Medical Scientist Training Program trainee at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, and first author of the study in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; that provides new clues into how people with autism process touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By better understanding how the brain processes different types of touch, we hope to someday work toward more healthy outlets of expression to avoid self-injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used several technological methods to create a more realistic sensory experience for active touch—reaching and touching—and passive touch—being touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A virtual reality headset simulated visual movement, while a vibrating finger clip—or vibrotactile disc—replicated touch. Using EEG, researchers measured the brain responses of 30 neurotypical adults and 29 adults with autism as they participated in active and passive touch tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure active touch, participants reached out to touch a virtual hand, giving them control over when they would feel the vibrations. To measure passive touch, a virtual hand reached out to touch them. The participant felt vibrations when the two hands “touched,” simulating physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the researchers found that the neurotypical group had a smaller response in a brain signal to active touch when compared to passive touch, evidence that the brain does not use as many resources when it controls touch and knows what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the group with autism showed little variation in brain response to the two types of touch. Both were more in line with the neurotypical group’s brain response to passive touch, suggesting that in autism, the brain may have trouble distinguishing between active and passive inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be a clue that people with autism may have difficulty predicting the consequences of their actions, which could be what leads to repetitive behavior or stimming,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a surprising finding, particularly in adults. John Foxe, PhD, director of the Golisano Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Institute at the University of Rochester and co-senior author of the study, remarked that this may indicate the difference in children with autism could be greater than their neurotypical counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many adults with autism have learned how to interact effectively with their environment, so the fact that we’re still finding differences in brain processing for active touch leads me to think this response may be more severe in kids, and that’s what we also need to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, Location, Location: Student Pools University Resources to Advance Autism Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went into my PhD with the idea to have one big project that would use resources and expertise from both labs,” said Isenstein, who was co-mentored by Foxe and Duje Tadin, PhD, professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and co-senior author on the &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew pretty early on that I wanted to study something that would help us understand stimming, but it’s a pretty complicated concept. Everyone has been incredibly supportive of me building my ‘dream team’ of collaborations to make this experiment possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isenstein employed the expertise in EEG and touch from the Frederick J. and Marion A. Schindler Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab for her study. While the means to study proprioception—or sense of self-movement—and virtual reality came from the Tadin Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are not stationary creatures, and things that happen when you are sitting still getting an EEG do not really mimic how you interact with things in real life,” said Isenstein. “It [virtual reality] was a really exciting way to study proprioception and body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was easy to see the importance of the project Emily proposed. It was also clear how difficult it would be to conduct a rigorous EEG study of active and passive touch in autism,” said Tadin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emily achieved this goal by spearheading the first collaboration between John’s lab and mine, leveraging the resources and expertise from the Medical Center and the University, including the Mary Ann Mavrinac Studio X. This is a wonderful example of the boundless possibilities in Rochester for a motivated student who takes advantage of the robust research resources that are available here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG, vibrotactile inputs, and virtual reality in research is not novel, but creating a study where the three technologies work in tandem, is a newer approach. Isenstein also turned to the Mary Ann Mavrinac Studio X at the University of Rochester to brainstorm how to get these technologies to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio X is an extended reality hub on campus that offers workshops, equipment rentals, and provides a multidisciplinary space for researchers and creators to collaborate on projects. “It really is an incredible resource for researchers trying to incorporate virtual reality into their research,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup went through several trial periods to figure out how to do it without compromising data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting when I could finally get to the point to use these technologies together,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We ended up mounting the VR headset onto a frame that people could just lean into and then their hands were free to move around and do whatever.

Conversely, there were overall larger magnitude P300 amplitudes in the autism group, but comparable levels of Passive-to-Active attenuation between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the autism cohort demonstrated variation from the neurotypical cohort with respect to the volition of the stimuli, but there were comparable results between groups in response to pattern deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that there are subtle differences in how adults with and without autism handle self-generated and externally-generated somatosensory sensations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpNks0YnlIbzNodWNjWU1DV2JYWjRZR0dob0N5U3JxZlpMMGRQTnlhYm5XVy1IV1hnb3duMUV0eTR3czQwM3Q2Z2xPc004M0FoaVdkM2F4QU1TTXlLWFZGLXNoWDYwakFuZUE</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员调查在华盛顿特区餐厅用餐的麻疹患者- WTOP | Health officials investigating person with measles who ate at DC restaurant - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQN0FscFlfVEJZM2lhTUJVak5MaFRDNzB3emJSa2YxT0JMdFdYRDgyeVc5VWkwODdpVjh0clhzbnpSQ1BDSW1HMGU5SUtlZWVseVNUV205MlhLbk5hZS03aHlyRHMzOC1JLS1HUjJlQ1BkcENyLVZhYjBhd0ZTLVcyRnlkeUZXZ203MXZYTDByME00ZUdFUjc4Y0Yxam1wRUZWUkktZ2p2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Anyone who was at the Five Guys restaurant at 1400 I Street NW on Saturday, April 5 between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. may have been exposed to the measles virus, according to D.C. Health.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The D.C. Department of Health says a person with a confirmed measles diagnosis ate at a local restaurant in early April. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Five Guys restaurant at 1400 I Street NW on Saturday, April 5 between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. may have been exposed to the measles virus, according to D.C. Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles develop in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The first stage begins seven to 14 days after exposure and often presents with a fever over 101 degrees along with a runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a cough. The second stage occurs three to five days after the initial symptoms start and consists of a rash on the face that gradually spreads to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;D.C. Health says a person with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were possibly exposed to measles and are not immune should contact their healthcare provider or D.C. Health at 844-493-2652 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with symptoms should immediately isolate and stay away from others, then call a healthcare provider. D.C. Health says that anyone with symptoms should call ahead before going to a healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room to notify them of any exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second known case of measles in D.C. this year. D.C. Health &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/dc-health-officials-confirmed-measles-case-in-the-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed a positive case of measles in late March&lt;/a&gt; in a person who rode on an Amtrak train to Union Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. counties with the most egregious &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5164926-contaminants-american-tap-water-research/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5164926-contaminants-american-tap-water-research/"&gt;water quality violations&lt;/a&gt; are concentrated in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oklahoma, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Standing out among the top-10 such regions was Wyoming County, W. Va., whose public water utility boasted the highest number of infringements in a single water system, according to the study, published Tuesday in international journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.70012"&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;About 2 million people nationwide — equivalent to Nebraska’s entire population — do not have running water, and this lack of basic drinking water services tends to occur in clusters, the study authors determined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This high number is neither equally nor proportionally distributed across the population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With another 30 million people reliant on &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4685181-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-systems-rate-hikes-filtration-epa-rule/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4685181-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-systems-rate-hikes-filtration-epa-rule/"&gt;drinking water systems&lt;/a&gt; that violate safety rules, the researchers sought to determine what types of systems are most prone to these deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many experts have proposed water privatization — the transfer of public water systems to the ownership or management of private companies — as a potential solution to making U.S. water cleaner and safer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, the authors explained, opponents have argued that such a switch could cause companies to prioritize profits over public needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore decided to investigative how the implementation of private versus public system operations impacts &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5236857-epa-review-fluoride-health-impacts-drinking-water/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/"&gt;water quality&lt;/a&gt; and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To do so, they mapped out the country’s distribution of system ownership, violations, water injustice and perceptions of water access among residents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the violations included in the research were failures to abide by regulations under the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/"&gt;Safe Drinking Water Act&lt;/a&gt;, such as exceedances of maximum contaminant levels, non-compliance with required water treatment protocols and the absence of monitoring schedules or communication to customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that privatization alone is not a solution,” lead author Alex Segrè Cohen, an assistant professor of science and risk communication at the University of Oregon, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The local context, such as regulatory enforcement, community vulnerability, and community priorities, matters in determining outcomes,” Segrè Cohen added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highest-ranking counties that exhibited water injustice issues were in Mississippi — home to eight out of top 10 such spots — as well as South Dakota and Texas, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers defined water injustice as “the unequal access to safe and clean drinking water that disproportionately impacts low-income households and people of color.” They thereby formulated a county-level score based on a combination of water system performance and community social vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Water injustice hotspots were more often situated in regions with lower private system ownership and stronger public system presence — suggesting that public systems are not necessarily superior at curbing violations, the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that residing in a county that has both increased water injustice and a higher proportion of privatized systems was linked to a stronger perception of vulnerability around water access and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the authors expressed hope that lawmakers and regulators would be able to utilize the research to inform their water management strategies and narrow down their areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Policymakers can use our findings to identify and prioritize enforcement efforts in hotspots, make improvements in infrastructure and implement policies that ensure affordable and safe drinking water — particularly for socially vulnerable communities,” Segrè Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;

People often assume that it must be safe if something grows in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/5/875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; points to a more complicated picture. Concerns have risen over the potentially harmful effects of long-term folk herb consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Noura Abou Zeinab, an assistant professor at &lt;a href="http://www.bau.edu.lb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Beirut Arab University&lt;/a&gt;, has led an investigation into some of these concerns. She explored how certain frequently consumed plants might impact liver and kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-herbs-under-suspicion"&gt;Herbs under suspicion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, medications have been primarily sourced from plants. Due to their high therapeutic potential and ability to improve well-being, which has improved quality of life since ancient times, herbal drugs are widely accepted by the general population,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various communities in the Middle East have long relied on homegrown solutions for digestive complaints and overall vitality. Some of these plants are now under the microscope because they may carry unknown risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herbal-supplements-often-contain-hidden-ingredients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; that are known among locals are rarely tested for prolonged use. Investigators discovered that certain extracts could affect internal organs in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-use-of-herbal-remedies"&gt;Long-term use of herbal remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted experiments on adult male rats.

Although these herbs have a long history of traditional use, their potential adverse effects should not be overlooked,” said Dr. Noura Abou Zeinab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-perspectives-on-health"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New perspectives on health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt; to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/synthetic-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;synthetic drugs&lt;/a&gt;. They might assume that a leaf or root with a long lineage of human use is free of undesirable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts caution that some herbal remedies contain potent chemicals that burden the liver and kidneys. Regulators continue to stress the importance of quality control to avoid contaminated or adulterated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-are-cautious"&gt;Experts are cautious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on herbal toxicity remain relatively scarce in comparison to pharmaceutical research. That gap in data means individuals might be tempted to assume safety without scientific proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators in different parts of the world have raised questions about the daily consumption of certain teas, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chia-seeds-have-great-potential-to-improve-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, or extracts. There is also concern that people may self-prescribe herbs at higher doses than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conflict-between-herbs-and-modern-drugs"&gt;Conflict between herbs and modern drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists and healthcare practitioners often advise people to inform their doctors about the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herbal-supplements-are-not-always-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herbal supplements&lt;/a&gt; that they regularly consume. Even mild interactions could pose problems, especially for those on prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the potential synergy or conflict between herbs and modern drugs is an ongoing challenge. Experts emphasize that patients should report all substances to their doctor, whether natural or synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-balance-with-herbal-remedies"&gt;Finding balance with herbal remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals argue that centuries of usage point to inherent safety. Others believe that scientific validation is necessary for each claim, no matter how time-honored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study encourages a cautious stance toward daily reliance on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wild-plant-extracts-can-block-covid-19-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant extracts&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to health choices, knowledge can reduce unfortunate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-paths-forward"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Potential paths forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials may explore whether moderate dosages or different preparations of these herbs could lessen any strain on the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-causes-liver-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; and kidneys. A better grasp of chemical composition might also pave the way for safer herbal solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public outreach campaigns could inform consumers about the possible downsides of unsupervised herbal remedies. This might involve educational programs that outline risks and emphasize expert guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fine-print-on-herbal-products"&gt;The fine print on herbal products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labels on herbs often lack comprehensive warnings. More detailed descriptions would help users make better choices before trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that process or market these items might consider investing in toxicity research.

Rory Kennedy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It all began in 2022, when Kennedy experienced a week of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/how-often-you-should-be-pooping-and-why-spontaneous-toilet-time-is-key/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:black, tarry stools;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;black, tarry stools&lt;/a&gt; — which can be caused by anything ranging from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/15/health/surgeon-urges-er-visit-if-you-have-blood-in-your-stool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gastrointestinal bleeding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gastrointestinal bleeding&lt;/a&gt; to eating too many blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He went to an urgent care clinic, where he was told it was probably “just an ulcer” or some bacteria, given some drugs, and sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I took [the drugs] and the symptoms seemed to alleviate over the next month,” he said. “So I didn’t think anything of it. Went on with my life. Everything was fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flash-forward to June 2024, when Kennedy saw “one single &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/17/health/3-signs-you-might-have-colorectal-cancer-and-a-scary-truth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bloody stool;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;bloody stool&lt;/a&gt;” — one of the most prominent &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/5-signs-of-colorectal-cancer-you-should-never-ignore/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signs of colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;signs of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; — and decided to see a gastroenterologist, especially since he had had intermittent &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/health/i-got-colorectal-cancer-at-39-4-warning-signs-that-i-missed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stomach pains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;stomach pains&lt;/a&gt; — which is another common sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He told me right away that if I had black, tarry stools back then, I should have gotten a colonoscopy and endoscopy immediately,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though colorectal cancer can sometimes be asymptomatic, Dr. Kiranmayi Muddasani, a staff surgeon in the Department of Colorectal Surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center, told The Post that a change in bowel habits or caliber of stool — as well as rectal bleeding or weight loss — are among the most common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s why a colonoscopy is the best way to detect and treat it earlier,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once they performed those procedures on Kennedy, he heard a sentence no one ever wants to hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s when I was hit with the brick of news: ‘You have a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/got-diagnosed-colon-cancer-44-100000378.html" data-ylk="slk:mass in your colon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;mass in your colon&lt;/a&gt;,’” he said. “I was surprised.

Rory Kennedy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What followed was “pretty intensive” surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, during which 10 inches of colon, some small intestine, appendix and 45 lymph nodes were removed. Cancer was found in eight out of the 45 lymph nodes, leading to a stage 3C diagnosis in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are letters involved because I guess every step is a little worse. So like 3A is not as bad as 3B, which is not as bad as 3C. 3C is the last letter for stage 3,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So I’m basically one notch away from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/health/woman-36-with-stage-4-bowel-cancer-was-fit-and-healthy-before-pain-started/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stage 4;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;stage 4&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It was, to say the least, devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I would say from the time I learned [the diagnosis] and all the way to like a month after, you’re just in a terrible headspace,” he said. “I have a wife, I have a newborn child that just turned 1 the day I was doing surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He began &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/02/us-news/cancer-patients-often-do-better-with-less-intensive-treatment-new-research-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemotherapy treatment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;chemotherapy treatment&lt;/a&gt;, which has taken a physical toll on his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s a lot of side effects,” he said. “You get nauseous, can’t sleep because you’re on steroids the first few days that are supposed to alleviate the nausea but you’re still nauseous so you’re taking pills for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chemo weakens the immune system, leading to frequent illnesses — which means he can’t be around his young son as much as he’d like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When he gets tears in his eyes, they burn — and so does his mouth, a lesser-known condition known as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/health/common-cancer-treatment-can-have-this-painful-side-effect/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“chemo mouth.”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“chemo mouth.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Have you ever gotten a pizza burn? When you eat a hot pizza and it burns the top of your mouth? Imagine that feeling everywhere — in your mouth, your gums and in your throat,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even still, Kennedy believes the hardest part of having cancer is the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/18/health/rising-colorectal-cancer-rates-in-young-people-new-concerns-idd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:uncertainty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a wife, I have a newborn child that just turned 1 the day I was doing surgery,” he said.

Oh my gosh, I’m not going to see my kid go to kindergarten or I’m not going to see him graduate high school or get married or any of these things. Oh my gosh, I may not be able to even have another kid. My wife’s going to move on without a husband. Do I tell her to find a new husband? Do I need to build a will?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He credits his wife, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/COLONTOWN/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Facebook support groups;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Facebook support groups&lt;/a&gt; for people with cancer, and his faith with getting him through the darkest days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I am a Christian and I would say it’s made me an even a stronger Christian, made me even more faithful,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And, through all the pain, getting cancer has given him one silver lining — it’s made him &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/health/mindfulness-is-an-effective-workplace-tool-survey-reveals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:practice mindfulness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;practice mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“On the good side, I’ve been more present in the moment, because I don’t know how many good moments I’m going to have,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Currently, Kennedy is finishing chemo, after which he will undergo scans and blood tests to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/21/health/a-new-saliva-test-could-help-accurately-detect-prostate-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:check for cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;check for cancer&lt;/a&gt;. If the tests are clear, he will be in remission, but he will have a 40%-50% chance of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If he’s cancer-free for five years, he will be discharged — but still faces a 10% lifetime &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/new-kidney-cancer-vaccine-puts-9-patients-into-remission/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recurrence risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recurrence risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would rather do 30 colonoscopies in a row than go through freaking chemo,” he said.

But if there’s one thing he regrets — it’s that he didn’t &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/27/health/top-colonoscopy-mistakes-people-make-before-colorectal-cancer-screening/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:get a colonoscopy sooner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;get a colonoscopy sooner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Sometimes, I wonder — when I had the black tarry [stools], I wish the doctor would have told me back then, ‘Hey, I’m referring you to a GI.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He has decided to share his story in the hopes of urging people to get colonoscopies, emphasizing that a colonoscopy is the only way to prevent colon cancer by removing precancerous polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He also stressed that — contrary to common belief — the procedure is quick, painless (under anesthesia) and easy to recover from. And it sure beats the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I don’t want other people to go through this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I highly don’t recommend cancer, it’s really not fun.

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, Ora Larson recognizes what’s happening. “It feels like you’re shaking inside,” she said. “I’m speeded up. I’m anxious.” If someone asks whether she would like a salad for lunch, she doesn’t know how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has had several such episodes this year, and they seem to be coming more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She stares and gets a gray color and then she gets confused,” her daughter, Susan Larson, 61, said. “It’s really scary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoglycemia occurs when levels of blood sugar, or glucose, fall too low; a reading below 70 milligrams per deciliter is an accepted definition. It can afflict anyone using glucose-lowering medications to control the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it occurs more frequently at advanced ages. “If you’ve been a diabetic for years, it’s likely you’ve experienced an episode,” said Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco, who researches diabetes in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora Larson, 85, has had Type 2 diabetes for decades. Now her endocrinologist and her primary care doctor worry that hypoglycemia may cause falls, broken bones, heart arrhythmias and cognitive damage.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Both have advised her to let her hemoglobin A1c, a measure of average blood glucose over several months, rise past 7%. “They say, ‘Don’t worry too much about the highs — we want to prevent the lows,’” Susan Larson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her mother has spent 35 years working to maintain an A1c below 7% — a common recommendation, the goal people sing and dance about in pharma commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She faithfully injects her prescribed drug, Victoza, about three times a week and watches her diet. She’s the oldest member of the Aqua for Arthritis class at a local pool in St. Paul, Minn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when her doctors recommended a higher A1c, she resisted. “I think it’s a bunch of hooey,” she said. “It didn’t make sense to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She got a lot of encouragement and recognition from her physicians for controlling her diabetes, staying on top of it,” her daughter explained. “They always praised her ‘tight control.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For someone who’s been so compliant all these years, it’s like they changed the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Revised recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, the &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.12514"&gt;American Geriatrics Society called for a hemoglobin A1c of 7.5% to 8% for most older adults&lt;/a&gt; with diabetes, and 8% to 9% for those contending with multiple chronic illnesses and limited life expectancy. (Ora Larson has multiple sclerosis and hypertension.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other medical societies and advocacy groups, including the &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S128/157561/6-Glycemic-Goals-and-Hypoglycemia-Standards-of"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/5/1520/5413486"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;, have also revised their guidelines upward for older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxing aggressive treatment can involve stopping a drug, lowering a dose or switching to another medication — an approach called de-intensification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of effective new diabetes drugs — GLP-1 receptor agonists (like Ozempic) and SGLT2 inhibitors (like Jardiance) — has further altered the landscape. Some patients can substitute these safer medications for risky older ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the new drugs can also complicate decisions, because not all older patients can switch — and for those who can, insurance companies may balk at the new medications’ high price tags and deny coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So de-intensification is proceeding, but &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(23)00215-6/fulltext"&gt;too gradually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785666"&gt;study of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, looked at patients who had gone to an emergency room or been hospitalized because of hypoglycemia. Fewer than half had their medication regimens de-intensified within 100 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35318647/"&gt;Nursing home residents&lt;/a&gt; are the ones that get into trouble,” said Dr. Joseph Ouslander, a geriatrician at Florida Atlantic University and the editor-in-chief of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 2021 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2777044"&gt;study, of Ontario nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;, found that more than half of residents taking drugs for Type 2 diabetes had A1c levels below 7%. Those with the greatest cognitive impairment were being treated most aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouslander has calculated, based on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24615164/"&gt;a national study&lt;/a&gt;, that roughly 40,000 emergency room visits annually resulted from overtreatment of diabetes in older adults from 2007 to 2011. He &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.19201"&gt;thinks the numbers are likely to be much higher now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The complex side of control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief primer: Diabetes can cause such grievous complications — heart attacks, stroke, vision and hearing loss, chronic kidney disease, amputations — that so-called strict glycemic control makes sense in young adulthood and middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tight control, like every medical treatment, involves a period of time before paying off in improved health. With diabetes, it’s a long time, probably eight to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older people already contending with a variety of health problems may not live long enough to benefit from tight control any longer. “It was really important when you were 50,” Lee said. “Now, it’s less important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older diabetics don’t always welcome this news. “I thought they’d be happy,” Lee said, but they push back. “It’s almost like I’m trying to take something away from them,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk that tight control will also set off hypoglycemia increases as patients age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoglycemia can make people sweaty, panicky, fatigued. When hypoglycemia is severe, “people can lose consciousness,” said Dr. Scott Pilla, an internist and diabetes researcher at Johns Hopkins. “They can become confused. If they’re driving, they could have an accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even milder hypoglycemic events “can become a qualify-of-life issue if they’re happening frequently,” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10169988/"&gt;causing anxiety&lt;/a&gt; in patients and possibly leading them to limit their activities, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts point to two kinds of older drugs particularly implicated in hypoglycemia: insulin and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513225/"&gt;sulfonylureas&lt;/a&gt; like glyburide, glipizide and glimepiride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people with Type 1 diabetes, whose bodies cannot produce insulin, injections of the hormone remain essential. But the medication is “widely recognized as a dangerous drug” because of its hypoglycemia risk and should be carefully monitored, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sulfonylureas, he added, “are becoming less and less used” because, while less risky than insulin, they also cause hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great majority of older adults with diabetes have Type 2, which gives them more options. They can supplement the commonly prescribed drug metformin with the newer GLP-1 and SGLT2 drugs, which also have cardiac and kidney benefits. If necessary, they can add insulin to their regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Added concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the new drugs’ more popular consequences, however, is weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For older people, if they’re frail and not very active, we don’t want them losing weight,” Pilla pointed out. And both metformin and the GLP-1 and SGLT-2 medications can have gastrointestinal or genitourinary side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Dan Marsh, 69, an accountant in Media, Pa., has treated his Type 2 diabetes by injecting two forms of insulin daily. When he takes too much, he said, he wakes up at night with “the damn lows,” and needs to eat and take glucose tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet his A1c remains high, and last year doctors amputated part of a toe. Because he takes many other medications for a variety of conditions, he and his doctor have decided not to try different diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know there’s other stuff, but we haven’t gone that way,” Marsh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the new options, including continuous glucose monitors, “figuring out the optimal treatment is becoming more and more difficult,” Pilla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, though, “older people overestimate the benefit of blood-sugar lowering and underestimate the risk of their medications,” he said. Often, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36800554/"&gt;their doctors haven’t explained how the trade-offs shift with older age&lt;/a&gt; and accumulating health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora Larson, who carries chewable glucose tablets with her in case of hypoglycemia (fruit juice and candy bars are also popular antidotes), intends to talk over her diabetes treatment with her doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good idea. “The biggest risk factor for severe hypoglycemia is having had hypoglycemia before,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have one episode, it should be thought of as a warning signal. It’s incumbent on your doctor to figure out, Why did this happen? What can we do so your blood sugar doesn’t go dangerously low?”&lt;/p&gt;

Much of his work has been bankrolled by Canada’s maple syrup industry and the Canadian and American governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At the same time, he has taken on another role: maple syrup pitchman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I am uniquely qualified as the world’s leading researcher on maple health benefits with the scientific reputation and credibility to promote the sales of maple products,” he has written in grant applications. He has assured leaders of the Canadian industry that he would always support maple from Quebec, according to emails obtained through a public records request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As he straddles the realms of scientific inquiry and promotion, he has distorted the real-world implications of his findings and exaggerated health benefits, according to a review by The Examination and The New York Times of 15 years of his studies and public statements. In videos and press releases, he has suggested that consuming maple syrup may help stave off diseases including cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes. Other scientists told The Examination and The Times that they thought he had overstated his lab findings and made misleading claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Industry funding is commonplace in nutrition research and may become even more critical as scientists grapple with the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts. Dr. Seeram’s work shows the perils of intertwining science and salesmanship, propelling information that can shape consumer habits and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At the University of Rhode Island, where he worked until last year, Dr. Seeram oversaw projects that were awarded $2.6 million in U.S. government funding, including a grant explicitly intended to increase maple syrup sales. That promotional work produced a stream of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.facebook.com/URIMaplePromo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;social media posts&lt;/a&gt; like, “Maple Syrup’s Benefits: Anti-Cancer, Anti-Oxidant, Anti-Inflammatory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; study says that CT scans could account for 1 in 20 &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases diagnosed each year if current overuse doesn't change.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;CT scans are an essential tool used to diagnose a range of medical conditions, but ionizing radiation exposure occurs as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stringent use of CT scanning could help mitigate risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US researchers are warning of the potential risks from CT scans, a standard method used to create detailed images of the body for diagnosing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans use X-rays to create a three-dimensional image of a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanner looks like a large tube. A patient lying on a table is moved inside the scanner, and X-ray instruments inside the machine are used to take hundreds of pictures of their body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is different than magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, although the tube-like equipment used to scan the patient is similar. MRI scanners instead use powerful magnets to send radio waves through the body to create images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both enable &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/radiology-a-look-inside-the-body/a-19563080"&gt;highly detailed pictures of the human body&lt;/a&gt; to be produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, exposure to X-rays comes with risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"CT can save lives, but its potential harms are often overlooked," said Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist from University of California San Francisco, who was a lead researcher on the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why X-rays harm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into radiation of different wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center is the visible spectrum — the light that animals like us can perceive — including wavelengths that we see as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But electromagnetic waves also exist on either side of the visible spectrum. On one side is low-frequency, long-wavelength radiation. &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/no-cancer-danger-from-mobile-phones-research-concludes/a-70133650"&gt;This radiation includes radio waves&lt;/a&gt;, microwaves and infrared, and is less energetic than visible light. Radio waves are used by MRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side is high-frequency, short-wavelength radiation that includes ultraviolet (UV), X-rays and gamma rays. These are more energetic than visible light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's this high-frequency radiation — known as "ionizing" radiation — that poses a health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionizing radiation can strip atoms of their electrons. That means it has enough energy to damage tissue at the molecular level. In humans, this damage can lead to a range of issues, including cancer. UV is commonly known as a health risk due to sun exposure, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While X-rays are high-energy forms of radiation, they are also an essential tool for providing &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/medicine/t-71742676"&gt;medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; with vital insights into patient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1 in 20 cancers could one day be traced to CT scan use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778" title="External link — new research"&gt;new research&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; modeled the likelihood of developing cancer in 61.5 million US patients who had received a CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model estimated that about 103,000 cancer diagnoses could result from CT exposure over the lifetime of the patients studied. That equates to about 5% of the total number of new cases annually in the US, assuming no change to the rate of CT use and cancer findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CT scans are being used more and more frequently as a diagnostic tool — up about 30% since 2007. Scan frequency also increases with age, with those age 60 to 69 having more than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis also found CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were more likely to result in cancers among adults, while head scans were the greatest risk for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children who underwent CT scans before their first birthdays were at 10 times greater risk of developing cancer than any other age group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight," said Smith-Bindman. "Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CT scans have some risk, but benefits are valuable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data obtained in the study applies to US patients and the American medical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman pointed to the misuse of CT as a diagnostic tool, including unnecessary or excessive scanning, including those used for respiratory infections or headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also highlighted variations in radiation doses used to effectively perform the scan, saying some patients receive excessive amounts that are not clinically needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other professionals in the field agree that misuse of CT scans can pose risks to patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is a well-established fact that high-energy radiation causes cancer," said Pradip Deb, a radiation safety expert at RMIT University, Australia, who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deb said while it's commonly understood that ionizing radiation like X-rays can damage DNA, and that increased exposure could exacerbate the severity of that damage, it's not clear how this would work for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not everyone who is exposed to radiation will get cancer," Deb said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are risks associated with radiation exposure, CT scans remain invaluable for diagnosing health problems that — when addressed —  could improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The estimated risk [of exposure] sometimes can cause panic among the patients who are benefiting from radiation," Deb said. "Radiations are routinely used for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This study has clearly established the importance of limiting the radiation dose where possible and of avoiding unnecessary CT scans if other low-radiation or no-radiation procedures can do the same job."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top doctor has revealed a life-changing hack that could provide instant relief to the millions of people kept up at night by restless leg symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14591519/Doctor-technique-beat-overthinking-insomnia-infinity-tracing.html"&gt;Dr Joe Whittington&lt;/a&gt;, a US-based emergency room medic, tying socks around the feet could help calm overactive nerves that drive the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an Instagram post that has been viewed more than 120,000 times, Dr Joe—who revealed he suffers from restless legs himself—urged people to try the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tying a sock or wrap just below your toes might actually calm restless leg syndrome' and, there is 'real science' behind it, Dr Joe claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Known medically as Willis-Ekbom disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482545/Restless-legs-causes-misery-unusual-cure-help-DR-SCURR.html"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which affects one in ten adults, is described by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-05452610-19dd-11f0-9959-415bc15f02d6" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; as an overwhelming urge to move the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients often report the symptoms being at their worst at night, in bed, when the body is relaxed—although it is not clear why, or what causes the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, it can also cause unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe, who has 782,000 Instagram followers, demonstrated in the video how to tie the socks to provide long-lasting relief: 'Make it just snug enough to apply a little bit of pressure. Do this for both feet.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor added: 'This simple foot compression technique can significantly reduce restless leg syndrome symptoms by triggering pressure points that help relax overactive nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As someone who struggles with restless legs themselves, this technique has been by far the most effective thing for me and my symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn't just work for him, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A clinical study has been shown to decrease restless leg symptoms in 90 per cent of the people that tried it', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe's intervention comes as patients were warned last month that the drugs used to treat restless leg symptoms could trigger an unexpected and bizarre sexual side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs—known as dopamine antagonists—interact with parts of the brain that control movement, helping to ease restless leg symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, more that a dozen women have now claimed the drugs, such as ropinirole, saw them develop compulsive gambling and sex addictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'unusual urge to gamble or increased sexual urges' is listed as a general side-effect in the patient information leaflets provided alongside the drug.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With women twice as likely to develop restless leg syndrome as men, Dr Joe stresses the benefits of the life-changing and 'drug free' hack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also believe that exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night, and following a regular bedtime routine could help ease symptoms in mild cases of restless leg syndrome that are not linked to an underlying health condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-15T08:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Tuesday, April 15, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Repurposing a blood pressure drug may prevent vision loss in inherited blinding diseases&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH studies in animals show reserpine protects retinal-neurons necessary for vision, especially in females. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New studies in rats suggest the drug reserpine, approved in 1955 for high blood pressure, might treat the blinding disease retinitis pigmentosa. No therapy exists for this rare inherited disease, which starts affecting vision from childhood. A report on the studies, conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), published today in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of reserpine’s effectiveness may greatly speed therapeutics for retinitis pigmentosa and many other inherited retinal dystrophies, which can be caused by one of more than a thousand possible mutations affecting more than 100 genes. Reserpine’s neuroprotective effect is independent of any specific underlying gene mutation,” said the study’s lead investigator, Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., senior investigator at NIH’s National Eye Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal dystrophies cause degeneration of the retina, the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. Vision loss can be present at birth or develop later in early adulthood. Disease progression varies depending on the gene involved. Some genetic defects may be inherited as dominant, where a mutation in just one of the two copies of the gene (one each from the mother and father) is sufficient to cause vision loss. Other genetic defects are recessive, where both copies of a gene must carry a mutation to cause vision loss. Gene therapies to correct inherited retinal dystrophies are promising, but take a long time to develop, are gene specific, and are often quite expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings are the latest evidence that reserpine improves survival of photoreceptor cells, the light-detecting retinal neurons that die in retinitis pigmentosa and other retinal dystrophies. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/fda-approved-drug-shows-promise-lab-models-blinding-childhood-disease"&gt;the Swaroop Lab demonstrated reserpine’s potential for preventing vision loss from LCA10&lt;/a&gt;, a retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the &lt;em&gt;CEP290&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its latest work, Swaroop’s team tested reserpine in a rat model of a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa caused by a mutation in the visual pigment gene rhodopsin. This disease mutation is common in Irish Americans with retinitis pigmentosa. Compared to untreated rats, reserpine preserved the process by which photoreceptors convert light that enters the eye into electrical signals that are sent to the brain to produce vision, known as phototransduction, in retinal cells called rod photoreceptors. Rod photoreceptors enable low-light vision; cone photoreceptors enable color vision in bright light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, reserpine better protected rod photoreceptors in female rats compared to males. The scientists also observed significant preservation of cone photoreceptors in female rats compared to male rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can only speculate about these sex-specific differences. However, future research would benefit from teasing out these differences and understanding them to lay a foundation for personalized approaches to retinal disease therapy,” Swaroop said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swaroop’s lab is developing additional, and more potent reserpine-related drugs. The idea would be to use such options to treat late-onset or slowly progressing inherited retinal dystrophies or to simply stall vision loss in aggressive retinitis pigmentosa varieties until more effective treatments are developed that can reverse that vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserpine is no longer used for treating high blood pressure because of its side effects. The required dosage for treating retinal degeneration, however, would be very low and directly delivered in the eye. Reserpine is a small molecule therapy, which makes it easy to deliver to target tissues in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ha1wax0006336o1cdd70bp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a Cabinet meeting last week, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed what is now the second-worst measles outbreak in the US since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t002z336ocp4muj0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has claimed repeatedly that measles cases have “plateaued,” despite contradictory data from his own federal agencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0030336o9b4jdn2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, the health department in Texas – the center of the outbreak that now spans multiple states – reported 232 new cases over the past three weeks, 42% more than in the three weeks before that. New outbreaks have also been reported in &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/diseases-and-conditions-resource-page/measles/" target="_blank"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/summary-of-infectious-diseases-in-ohio" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthy.arkansas.gov/article/second-case-of-measles-in-arkansas-identified-in-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0031336o8zixqh1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, there have been at least 735 cases in 24 states this year, according to CNN’s tally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0032336ogpw6axk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, many experts believe that the actual case count stands in the thousands.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0033336o5qnhep72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think any of us have full situational awareness of what’s going on with this outbreak,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “You can’t say something is flattening if you don’t actually know the denominator of cases or [have] an understanding you’re getting [the] full capture of the cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0034336ovgfv0pid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some experts think the number of deaths alone indicates that cases are deeply undercounted. The measles fatality rate is typically up to 3 deaths per 1,000 cases. But three deaths have already been reported in the ongoing outbreak in — two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico — even though the official outbreak case count stands at not quite 650 between Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9htsf2900003b6oyslzz5ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Underreporting could also be happening for a variety of reasons, and that makes it difficult to predict exactly how bad this outbreak will get and how long it will last, said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, and a former epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0037336ok37d3l7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Better data would be helpful, Masters said, to help public health officials set expectations about how big an outbreak might get, to help public health departments figure out where to allocate resources and to better understand what might be affecting cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjirbw00013b6ocsavt3pk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak has mainly infected people who were not vaccinated or whose vaccine status is unknown. If a local agency knows who is unvaccinated, it could do more targeted outreach to help persuade them to get protected against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0039336ool4uktz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine works rapidly and has been shown to provide the best protection against measles, particularly when it’s given to people in affected areas quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003a336oooohimal@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a measles outbreak at a migrant shelter in Chicago last year, Masters – then with the CDC – created a model to predict the size of the outbreak and another to determine what effect interventions would have.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003b336owx9yhzwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In both of those models, the results were very non-subtle that mass vaccination is really the way to bring these outbreaks under control, and the days matter. If you delay by a week, that increases the size of the outbreak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003c336okl42ehgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without mass vaccinations in the affected community in Chicago, the model predicted, there would be 250 cases. But because vaccines were administered quickly, there were only 57.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003e336ov7dv7rlo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Mark S. Roberts was part of an effort to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31433482/" target="_blank"&gt;create a model&lt;/a&gt; that took into account Texas’ expected number of unvaccinated to predict what a measles outbreak there would look like.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjn5ie00063b6oeumfroyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Until recently, the prediction was eerily similar to the case count in the current outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;said Roberts, a distinguished professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management and director of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjmpd900043b6ob9j33q3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, though, cases in some counties have even outpaced the prediction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003f336ow6tqbe92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak, had 355 cases as of April 11, and the state health department says that number is expected to continue to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003g336ongqdbfte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If there had been an outbreak in Gaines County in 2018, Roberts’ model predicted 270 cases, 100 of whom would be “bystanders” — not children whose parents refused vaccination but those who couldn’t get vaccinated or for whom the vaccine hadn’t fully worked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjoumr00083b6owiuglwo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts and many other public health experts are frustrated by the deaths that have already taken place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003h336o7r286mu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s freaking 2025, and a child has died of measles,” Roberts said. “It’s just not right. This is a disease that, 12 years ago, we basically had eradicated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003i336or9uy8pja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models are helpful in an outbreak, but even with all the data in the world, Roberts knows, not everyone is going to listen to the message that the unvaccinated need protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjqicq000b3b6o6kp2ilqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, he presented his model to the Texas Legislature. Lawmakers asked good questions and understood what he showed them, he said, but not a single law was passed to improve vaccination rates in Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003j336ox1uczg7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The thing that’s really sad about this is that all of this was predictable and totally avoidable,” Roberts said. “It’s just really sad.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003l336ovj1sa3oh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases may be undercounted in the ongoing outbreak, Masters said, because people aren’t getting tested or because they may be staying away from hospitals. In the Mennonite community that has been the center of the outbreak in Texas, there is a great sense of self-reliance and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;a preference for home remedies&lt;/a&gt; over doctors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003m336ocdodl113@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s a little difficult to tease apart which element of the underreporting Is leaning in which direction,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003n336oidl2bi02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another reason it’s been hard to get an accurate case count is because of massive federal funding cuts for public health. The CDC pulled back over &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/health-department-grant-cuts-cdc-hhs/index.html"&gt;$11 billion in grants&lt;/a&gt; allocated during the Covid-19 pandemic that state and local health departments had been using to respond to a variety of public health threats, including measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hj7zem00003b6ot7td7oe0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In New Mexico, where at least 58 cases&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have been reported, a pullback of federal funds meant the public health department had to terminate contracts for 20 temporary workers who were helping with the measles response by checking vaccination records.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003o336ot18uy78n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phil Huang, Health and Human Services director in Dallas County, Texas, said that in addition to canceling dozens of vaccine clinics in school districts with low vaccination rates, he had to lay off 11 permanent staff and 10 temporary workers, including three who work in the labs used to detect measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003p336ojmta10rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those are our numbers so far,” he said. “We are looking at perhaps a few further cuts in the near future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003q336ocz7b93zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These cuts mean real numbers may become even more difficult to pin down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003t336o0if7rl0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles, a highly contagious virus, behaves in an entirely predictable fashion, Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003u336o8tbu8q7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It behaves almost the same way in almost every setting,” she said. “If someone has measles, they go into a room with a bunch of people who are susceptible to measles, a lot of those people are going to get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003v336ovttvnhan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said last week that the US is a “model for the rest of the world” when it comes to managing measles, but the country is no longer as effective at preventing outbreaks because of decreasing vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003w336o22sgnyl5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Saying we’re better or no worse off than other countries, that’s misleading at best and kind of a whitewash of the significance of this measles outbreak,” said Dr. Bill Moss, a professor in epidemiology and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003x336om2nvlago@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is true that, historically, the United States has done better than many other countries in the world,” he said. “That’s because we’ve had a strong immunization program.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003y336oamnvmvtb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles had been declared eliminated in the US in 2000 because the majority of people were vaccinated, but that number has been falling since the Covid-19 pandemic – even before a lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines/index.html"&gt;with a history&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine skepticism took over HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003z336ouxduzc5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, just 68.5% of kids in the US had their first dose of the MMR vaccine by 15 months of age, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/health/measles-vaccine-first-dose-decline/index.html"&gt;new report from Truveta&lt;/a&gt;. This is a significant decline from 2020, when more than 77% of kids got their first shot by this age. And it’s far short of the federal goal of 95% of children in kindergarten having had their second dose, the threshold needed to prevent measles outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year had not gotten the shot. Some other counties in the affected states also fall below the 95% benchmark, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In Kansas, for example, only 90% of kindergartners have gotten their MMR vaccines. The Sublette Unified School District in the southwestern part of the state, where most of the state’s cases are concentrated, has a vaccination rate of just 44%, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data" target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Working on Truveta’s report “set off real alarm bells for me,” Masters said.

            Current measles vaccination rates mean the country is no longer closing immunity gaps like it used to, “which is very concerning for the future of this outbreak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy has said that people should get the MMR vaccine, but he has also said that doing so should be a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;personal choice.&lt;/a&gt;

            With so much hesitancy in areas that have seen so many cases, experts say that here needs to be a clearer message from the top and that, as with a 2019 measles outbreak, many more people will need to be convinced that getting a vaccine is not just in their best interest, it is also in the best interest of the community.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s important for people to know, not vaccinating your child doesn’t only put your child at risk, it puts other children at risk,” Roberts said.

Two Mennonite residents, Helen and Helena, had conflicting views on the jabs. One said she vaccinated her children because it was the right thing to do, while the other said she didn't - believing infections like measles "make their immune system stronger".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Another resident, Joselyn said she doesn't want to vaccinate her children because she claims to know people who have suffered adverse reactions. Judy said her family have gone without the MMR vaccine because they "don't like the things in it". Of the 700 measles cases in the US, 541 have been recorded in Texas alone - and&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;70% of these cases are among children and young babies.&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Measles is an infectious virus that weakens the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to secondary infections like pneumonia. Those who are vaccinated have a significantly lower risk of falling ill, as the jab is 93% effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97% effective after a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Many in the Mennonite community however believe vaccinations should be a personal choice, even though they are not strictly forbidden in scripture. Around 3,000 people out of 22,000 in Gaines County follow the Mennonite faith, according to figures released in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9jcW55a0JpRXh1ZHBiRzBNRjJWTF9SWkxCSzRKb01WbEU1Q1JPZU41R0ItQ2JlQ2RWbVM3UDZxSjVHZEE1ak9mX0RoaUY0MjFtNC02bEk1OGZPMUhOZk95Y3ZWNUNCb1JzQVRzVkFEUTNONTlfcFRIWC00SU5vR2PSAYQBQVVfeXFMT3d5elF6bkdtVzRhSDRQTGlibjR4US1LSHU5YzdBaFU3RWQ4Q2xSU0lBSnJnTUktTWNuM1NkcGVfbUFwSkNKNGZiNERBMDYyTUozOUV0RnItSUc3NGVGRW0wQ215am5qZjhfYTlrSllsdFVkcTd3NDJKM2pzbXpVampKMFot</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员确认密歇根州另一例麻疹病例- ClickOnDetroit | Health officials confirm another case of measles in Michigan - ClickOnDetroit</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxObkpHNFVIaDRlVXlheTBfUm1uSTltMENvUEEyNVVIUklueTN2TTNhMVM0Zm92bDFtQzB6TTFFLTBNLU5sX2xWNHItS0pnTDBIX1l4YzlWbWtTMU1ac2hVRlMyRHJTeE55SE9RTHlMcGZDNE0zN0VfaXlGUHN3eWJRV1pnTlVSTTEtM1loUWtmUWZVS1l0UnJjbExHeDRSajM4N25GdkJkVlE1andLWldzYlR6cXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A new case of measles is confirmed in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A baby girl in Ingham County got sick after traveling out of state.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS-led research is reporting that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the precuneus may slow the progression of cognitive decline, impairments in daily functioning, and behavioral symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Patients who received 52 weeks of rTMS showed slower deterioration across clinical outcomes compared to those who received sham stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;rTMS delivers magnetic pulses to targeted brain areas and is considered a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. It is used to treat conditions like depression and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obsessive-compulsive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; by inducing small electrical currents in brain cells to modify &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; and help reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus brain region has been identified as a promising site for stimulation due to its early involvement in Alzheimer's pathology, including amyloid deposition, gray matter loss, and disrupted connectivity within brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In animal models, rTMS has been shown to reduce beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, increase neurogenic proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous Phase II trial found that 24 weeks of precuneus-targeted rTMS slowed cognitive decline and reduced loss of daily functional abilities in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Next, researchers wanted to see if extending rTMS treatment to 52 weeks could continue to preserve cognition and function over the longer time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Effects of 52 weeks of precuneus rTMS in Alzheimer's disease patients: a randomized trial," &lt;a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-025-01709-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a sham-controlled, randomized, and double-blind pilot trial.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The cohort included 48 patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. A total of 27 patients were assigned to receive rTMS, and 21 were assigned to a sham stimulation group. Among them, 31 were continuing from a previous 24-week trial that used the same experimental design, and 17 were newly enrolled and randomized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing participants remained in their original treatment group and extended their participation by an additional 28 weeks, bringing their total duration of rTMS or sham exposure to 52 weeks. Newly enrolled participants began treatment at the start of the trial and completed a full 52-week course, which included a two-week intensive phase followed by weekly maintenance sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulation was delivered using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation paired with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to personalize the location and intensity for each participant. Each session involved 40 two-second trains at 20 Hz spaced over 20 minutes, totaling 96,000 pulses per patient across the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who received &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/repetitive+transcranial+magnetic+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; experienced a slower rate of cognitive and functional decline compared to those in the sham group. The primary outcome, measured by change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale–Sum of Boxes, showed an estimated mean change of 1.36 points in the stimulation group compared to 2.45 points in the sham group after 52 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Functional ability, assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study scale for activities of daily living, declined by an estimated 1.5 points in the rTMS group and 11.6 points in the sham group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale, showed a mean increase of 5.9 points in the rTMS group versus 10.4 points in the sham group. In this context, higher scores reflect greater impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scores on the Mini Mental State Examination declined by 1.1 points in the rTMS group and 3.9 points in the sham group. Behavioral symptoms, measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, also favored the rTMS group, with an estimated change of 3.28 points versus 6.91 points in the sham condition. Subscales showed measurable improvements in apathy, euphoria, and appetite-related disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion rate across both groups was 68%. Most participant withdrawals were linked to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mild adverse effects such as headache or scalp discomfort were reported in both groups and resolved without medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger baseline connectivity within the brain's default mode network was associated with a more favorable clinical response in the rTMS group, suggesting that brain activity profiling could help identify patients most likely to benefit from this treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that rTMS targeting the precuneus may reduce the progression of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The treatment also appeared to delay deterioration in daily functioning and reduce behavioral disturbances. Patients receiving rTMS did not show significant loss of autonomy over the one-year period, as measured by standardized assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some behavioral symptoms, including apathy, euphoria, and appetite-related changes, also improved in patients receiving rTMS. Fewer declines in activities of daily living may translate into lower caregiver burden and greater patient independence during early disease stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger studies across multiple sites are needed to confirm these findings and could also explore how rTMS could be used in combination with drug therapies that target amyloid, tau, or neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

It's particularly exciting that such a simple dietary addition could make a measurable difference to cognitive performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that while memory recall performance after two hours was worse when people ate walnuts, after six hours, the finding was reversed and walnuts outperformed the control dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to examine the immediate effect of walnuts on brain function for young adults throughout a single day, building on previous research that shows how regular nut consumption improves cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits of a walnut-rich breakfast were evident in a younger population, researchers noted that it remains to be seen whether it would also benefit older people or clinical populations, such as those with cognitive impairment or metabolic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings of brain activity suggest that walnuts may help the brain work more efficiently during challenging mental tasks, while blood samples revealed positive changes in glucose and fatty acid levels, which can influence brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested that walnuts have a special mix of &lt;a href="/topic/nutrients"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; - including omega-3 alpha linolenic fatty acids, &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, and plant compounds called polyphenols - that may improve how the brain performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers noted that more research was needed to fully understand how walnuts produce these beneficial effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQNmlLaTlDRDRJU1dzWmk5VjRFUWg0LXAzVkI2RHVVQmwwREd2VXlKVG80ZXc2REJYMFo1VHVTdlhCd002X3ljdjZSc1NTTWZfRFY3VHRDRk9oUml5eUdVYzNEdjlwMERjaFhSaDI0YjNmZzZkQVc5QW1RczZGTmlfdU9INXlrR3RfU3BzTVJIY0dGTS14bTdIUXZzWVpIS0FQLUhXOEhKdFE2QmJVSlplTlV0WXoxRTFLQmM0</guid></item><item><title>快速家庭健康测试：检查您的反应时间- BBC | Quick home health tests: Check your reaction times - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWTBFZXpvREZUcVVuQzdpSF9zNUUtT0hobUVDZ0lnd2h0ZDE1dENsbGZBQmZXLVIwbVBwSmNXOXBHdjlRbTVmaDJsc0x4X3N5UllMbFVoMlBOZERzM2hSdjhza0dWVHlaNWxkWURpakdITmhVOUsxR2pxSE5HYlZxR0kwSmZmNnlwN255Wnd6ek5uUS1EWVJlUUhIRmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Quick home health tests: Check your reaction times&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A black-and-white photo of a hand holding a stopwatch (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;(Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;b id="your-reaction-times-can-reveal-a-surprising-amount-about-what's-going-on-inside-your-body,-from-your-brain-health-to-your-risk-of-an-early-death." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Your reaction times can reveal a surprising amount about what's going on inside your body, from your brain health to your risk of an early death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Of the course of our lifetimes, our reaction times will slowly wane. It's one of the reasons why athletic performance tends to drop off &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39019444/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;from our 30s onwards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Scientists are finding that being able to maintain an average reaction speed can be a key indicator that our brain is still in good working order, even into our latter decades. But that isn't all they can reveal. From your heart health to your &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30100646/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;overall risk of an early death&lt;/a&gt;, your reaction times can provide a window into the inner workings of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Some people just tend to be faster than others, even before ageing effects really kick in," says Simon Cox, professor of brain and cognitive ageing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. "But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the "zero", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Broadly speaking, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4207053/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;an excellent performance equates&lt;/a&gt; to catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person's reaction times can be a reflection of both their cognitive and physical fitness (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;A person's reaction times can be a reflection of both their cognitive and physical fitness (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speeds &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280496/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;vary considerably&lt;/a&gt; from one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time – for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As Cox points out, our ability to react &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/motor-reaction-time" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;relies on&lt;/a&gt; a network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. "All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people," says Cox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test – the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423772/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds – but it still takes a while for the body to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Pain recommends so-called dual task training such as walking while turning your head from side to side or balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/44/15/e1596232024.full.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7493202" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;have waned&lt;/a&gt;, or because our mitochondria – the components within our cells which generate energy – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0501559102" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;are working less well&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster," says Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed this &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4208637/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;by measuring&lt;/a&gt; the "startle reflex" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a "move" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse," says Pain. "Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Measuring your reaction times throughout your life can help to track changes in your brain and bodily health (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Measuring your reaction times throughout your life can help to track changes in your brain and bodily health (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Human Benchmark Reaction Time Test&lt;/a&gt; which involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424122/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;One study last year&lt;/a&gt; found that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing," says Cox. "Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="improving-your-score" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="improving-your-score" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Improving your score&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times.

                An advisory committee of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is set to meet Tuesday to discuss vaccines for RSV, COVID and others.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the first time since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are meeting publicly to discuss the nation's vaccine policies. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A meeting of the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304233/cdc-vaccine-meeting-delayed" target="_blank"&gt;initially scheduled for February&lt;/a&gt; but was postponed, raising concerns among some scientists and those working in public health about political interference in vaccine policy. The two-day meeting starts Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's advice shapes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/15/nx-s1-5293507/cdc-rfk-vaccine-advice" target="_blank"&gt;access to and insurance coverage for vaccines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm reassured and very glad to see that it's happening," says &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/claire-hannan/" target="_blank"&gt;Claire Hannan&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. "It's important to have this ongoing review of data and science, looking at the evidence that goes into the vaccine schedule in an open forum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisory committee typically holds public meetings three times a year, which are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RR7Es9sdNpY" target="_blank"&gt;live streamed online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During this week's meeting, the committee's independent advisors will hear from CDC staff on a range of vaccines, including HPV, COVID and flu, and vote on recommendations for some of them such as RSV and the tropical mosquito-borne viral disease chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current agenda is similar to the proposed agenda for February, though it omits a vote on influenza vaccines that was on that agenda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When asked about the change, HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard responded on behalf of CDC: "ACIP agenda items are always subject to change depending on what the working groups have ready for consideration." She further clarified: "This was not the annual vote for the routine use of the influenza vaccine for the upcoming season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisors are independent experts who volunteer to serve on the committee. &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at UC San Francisco, says she expects them to remain independent and hold thoughtful, rigorous discussions as they usually do.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But she's concerned about the effects of political interference on CDC staff who help run these meetings, who "are in a much more vulnerable position after extensive layoffs," Reiss says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There have been deep cuts to CDC staff since President Trump took office, including some officials who would have participated or spoken in this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's had a chilling effect on those who are left.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'll be looking to see if they change the process in any way," Reiss says. For example she says she'll be watching for changes in how conflicts of interest are handled – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323771/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisers-conflicts-interest" target="_blank"&gt;a topic Kennedy has raised repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; – or whether they put time limits on discussions among committee members, Reiss says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Signs of political interference may be subtle, says Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and data scientist who writes the newsletter "&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Your Local Epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt;." What it may take, she says, is "for those of us that have listened to hundreds of ACIP meetings to report back whether it is just business as usual or there's some sketch things beneath the surface."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine advocates are concerned over potential shifts in policy and official stances that may reduce confidence in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I don't want to see go away is a very strong endorsement of the use of vaccines as preventive medicine," says Dr. Anthony Fiore, a former CDC official who worked closely with the vaccine advisory committee before retiring from the agency in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's concerned because Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cast doubt on vaccine safety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;canceled funding&lt;/a&gt; for research into vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Up to this point, every HHS director and every CDC director has been very enthusiastic about vaccines as they save money and they're an excellent preventive tool," Fiore says. But if public confidence in vaccines gets undermined, vaccination levels could drop below the levels needed to reduce transmission and protect the population from disease, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But getting sick is not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21858" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used 2019 data on cancer cases among U.S. adults ages 30 and older, and they estimated that about 40 percent of cases were caused by lifestyle factors you can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“That’s actually good news,” said Dr. Farhad Islami, the lead author of the study and senior scientific director of cancer disparity research at the American Cancer Society.

It was an opportunity to meet him and ask him a few questions. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIRED: Professor Ramakrishnan, the crucial question in your book is &lt;em&gt;why we die&lt;/em&gt;. But exactly what is death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venki Ramakrishnan:&lt;/strong&gt; By death, we mean the irreversible loss of the ability to function as a coherent individual. It is the result of the failure of a critical system or apparatus, for example, heart, brain, lung, or kidney failure. In this sense there is an apparent paradox: When our organism, as a whole, is alive, millions of cells within us are constantly dying, and we do not even realize it. On the other hand, at the time of death, most of the cells in our bodies are still alive, and entire organs are still functioning and can be donated to people in need of transplantation. But at that point the body has lost the ability to function as a whole. In this sense, it is therefore important to distinguish between cell death and death of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of death and aging, you say in your most recent book that you “wanted to offer an objective look at our current understanding of the two phenomena.” What was the biggest surprise or most deeply held belief that you had to reconsider while writing and researching this work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There have been several surprises, actually. One is that death, contrary to what one might think, is not programmed by our genes. Evolution does not care how long we live, but merely selects the ability to pass on our genes, a process known as “fitness” in evolutionary biology. Thus, the traits that are selected are those that help us survive childhood and reproduce. And it is these traits, later in life, that cause aging and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Another curious finding was the fact that aging is not simply due to wear and tear on cells. Wear and tear happens constantly in all living things, yet different species have very different lifespans. Instead, lifespan is the result of a balance between the expenditure of resources needed to keep the organism functioning and repairing it and those needed to make it grow, mature, and keep it healthy until it reproduces and nurtures offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQM3laYm4wb2hqTmxrdS1scmx4cXVuMmNZUjVBMGxFOTZWdGExOUR5Ynk1UndkUUx1M2lfaVpsc1JFVmlkcG1fcFJnU2psaVd6aVhxRmxwemQwWWxWVlRaUlVVQTQ1c2FVWjRsQlA5SWFhQXRjcHVyM0xKRGItS21kTjhLSzBQZWhhbEdpYUJ3MVlRY3lQZVR0eVQyODY</guid></item></channel></rss>
