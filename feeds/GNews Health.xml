It just gets hold of you. I thought I was the fittest, strongest, healthiest person, but on the inside I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's sad because I see a lot of young lads becoming affected by it. And that's why a lot of the bodybuilders are dying prematurely, because it's not healthy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have warned Mr Wilkinson that he will likely have medical issues for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has a meeting with his treatment team twice a week, and also has to take anxiety, sleeping, and epilepsy medication, as well as attend frequent appointments for brain scans and blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It could still all affect me later on, and I'm probably going to be on constant medication for the rest of my life,' says Mr Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have PTSD, body dysmorphia, a diagnosed eating disorder, regular flashbacks, and I'm having rehabilitation for trauma. I've also now become epileptic due to the coma.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anabolic-androgenic steroids are the most common type of 'image and performance enhancing drug'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are typically injected directly into the muscle, though can also be taken orally in tablet form or even as a cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors have said that he will likely suffer lifelong health implications from steroid use &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anabolic-androgenic steroids work by mimicking the effects of the male sex hormone testosterone, tricking the body into producing more muscular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this comes at a cost. Common side effects include: severe acne, kidney failure, high cholesterol and even stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark study published last year by Danish researchers found steroid users have an &lt;span&gt;almost 300 per cent increased risk of death within two decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor, an expert in anatomy at Lancaster University said: ‘The growth in people self prescribing steroids for performance reasons is of real concern.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a danger of suffering serious side effects if you are using these drugs, from heart attacks, and brain damage to long term mobility issues.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cases like this show the danger of anabolic steroids, and people need to be aware of the consequences when they see people promoting the drugs on their social media feeds.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wilkinson said he started taking steroids at 16 after struggling with body dysmorphia - a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about perceived flaws in their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The drugs were very accessible and I was weighing everything - even down to the sugar-free syrups in my coffees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It started as a hobby and then it became body dysmorphia. I could barely look in the mirror, and I would put jumpers and hoodies on to avoid showing my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And that explains the tattoos. I'm so body conscious. I've tried every diet out there, I've tried protein diet, meat and eggs diet, weight loss diets, the lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's because social media creates competition and you're constantly comparing yourself to others and looking at others trying to emulate them. It's a vicious circle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that steroid use is on the rise in young men fuelled by social media. Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The steroids were selfish, I didn't care about my son or my friends or my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it happens ever so slowly, you start taking steroids, and the benefits you see on the outside make you want to take more, but it isolates you from your friendships and bonds with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't want to socialise and spend time with my partner. I was just striving for perfection in the bodybuilding game when everything around me was falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My family nearly lost someone who was important in their lives - it was a tough time for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a real taboo around men and steroid use. There's AA for alcoholics, GA for gamblers, but not really a lot on steroid use and the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to show people who are struggling what I've been through, that these muscles are not worth the comas, seizures, constant brain scans, tubes out your mouth, possibly losing a member of your family - all because you want to look good and compare yourself on social media.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, animal sources tend to have much more, she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent YouGov study found that one in eight people in the UK report feeling tired ‘all the time’ and a quarter of us are tired ‘most of the time’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There’s even a medical acronym for it: TATT or ‘tired all the time’. While it is estimated more than 400,000 people in the UK suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include waking up exhausted despite sleeping well, headaches, mood swings and lack of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common causes can include iron deficiency, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, diabetes and hypothyroidism, which is when the thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones leading to slow metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common cause may also be depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Often triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress, the condition mimics a heart attack and primarily affects older women, though men experience more than double the mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-hospital deaths reached 6.5%, and complications such as heart failure, stroke, and cardiac arrest were common. The findings highlight the urgent need for improved diagnostics, early intervention, and targeted treatments for this often misunderstood condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Mortality Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; In-hospital death occurred in 6.5% of cases, with no decline over five years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Disparity:&lt;/strong&gt; Men faced a mortality rate of 11.2%, more than double that of women (5.5%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent Complications:&lt;/strong&gt; Over one-third developed heart failure; stroke and cardiac arrest were also common.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome, is associated with a high rate of death and complications, and those rates were unchanged between 2016 and 2020, according to new research published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a stress-related heart condition in which part of the heart temporarily enlarges and doesn’t pump well. It is thought to be a reaction to a surge of stress hormones that can be caused by an emotionally or physically stressful event, such as the death of a loved one or a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109934"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a heart with a crack in it." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/broken-heart-syndrome-health-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Deaths were more than double in men at 11.2% compared to the rate of 5.5% among women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can lead to severe, short-term failure of the heart muscle and can be fatal. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be misdiagnosed as a heart attack because the symptoms and test results are similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is one of the largest to assess in-hospital death rates and complications of the condition, as well as differences by sex, age and race over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that the death rate from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated,” said study author M. Reza Movahed, M.D., Ph.D., an interventional cardiologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Arizona’s Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed health records in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to identify people diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from 2016 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The death rate was considered high at 6.5%, with no improvement over period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deaths were more than double in men at 11.2% compared to the rate of 5.5% among women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major complications included congestive heart failure (35.9%), atrial fibrillation (20.7%), cardiogenic shock (6.6%), stroke (5.3%) and cardiac arrest (3.4%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People older than age 61 had the highest incidence rates of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, there was a 2.6 to 3.25 times higher incidence of this condition among adults ages 46-60 compared to those ages 31-45 during the study period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White adults had the highest rate of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (0.16%), followed by Native American adults (0.13%) and Black adults (0.07%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, socioeconomic factors, including median household income, hospital size and health insurance status, varied significantly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a serious condition with a substantial risk of death and severe complications,” Movahed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health care team needs to carefully review coronary angiograms that show no significant coronary disease with classic appearance of left ventricular motion, suggesting any subtypes of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. These patients should be monitored for serious complications and treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that age-related findings could serve as a useful diagnostic tool in discriminating between heart attack/chest pain and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may prompt earlier diagnosis of the condition and could also remove assumptions that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy only occurs in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the study’s limitations is that it relied on data from hospital codes, which could have errors or overcount patients hospitalized more than once or transferred to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there was no information on outpatient data, different types of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or other conditions that may have contributed to patients’ deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movahed said further research is needed about the management of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the reason behind differences in death rates between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysis included 199,890 U.S. adults from across the nation (average age 67; 83% of cases were among women).

The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome data of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy using a large inpatient database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods and Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for our study. We evaluated trends, mortality, and complications of patients admitted with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from available years 2016 to 2020 in adults &amp;gt;18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 199 890 patients with Takotsubo were found in our database with 83% being female and higher prevalence with age, White race, and highest income. Mortality was high at 6.5% with no significant improvement over the years studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, major complications were substantial. Cardiogenic shock occurred in 6.6%, atrial fibrillation in 20.7%, cardiac arrest in 3.4%, congestive heart failure in 35.9%, and stroke in 5.3%. Mortality was more than double in men in comparison to women (11.2% versus 5.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is associated with high mortality and complications with no improvement in outcome over the 5‐year study with higher mortality in men.

The researchers found that women with inattentive ADHD symptoms reported lower orgasmic consistency than those without ADHD symptoms or with other subtypes. These findings provide new insight into the challenges women with ADHD may face in their sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects about 2–6% of adults. It is typically characterized by patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. While ADHD has traditionally been studied more in men, there is growing recognition that women often experience different symptoms. Women are more likely to show signs of inattention, which are internal and less disruptive than hyperactivity, making them more prone to being overlooked or misdiagnosed. This difference in presentation can have far-reaching consequences, including in areas not often discussed—such as sexual functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has consistently shown that women experience lower rates of orgasm during partnered sex than men, a phenomenon often referred to as the “orgasm gap.” Although orgasm is not required for sexual satisfaction, persistent difficulty achieving orgasm—sometimes called anorgasmia—can lead to emotional distress and reduced relationship satisfaction. Some studies have linked problems with orgasm to cognitive distraction, such as intrusive thoughts or difficulty focusing during sex. Since inattention is a hallmark of one form of ADHD, the researchers wanted to know whether this might explain why some women experience less consistent orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that furthering research and education on women’s sexual health and well-being is essential in the pursuit of equality and to support their overall health,” explained study author Tina Jensen-Fogt of Kwantlen Polytechnic University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Discovering that the research on sexual pleasure for women with ADHD is very limited, we were inspired to expand on this topic to better understand how ADHD symptoms may affect women’s sexual experiences during partnered sex. Our primary goals were to explore how orgasmic consistency rates vary across the three subtypes of ADHD symptomatology, and to confirm whether women with inattentive ADHD subtype symptoms reported the lowest rate of orgasmic consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, researchers conducted a large online survey involving 815 cisgender women who were sexually active with at least one partner in the past six months. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 84 and represented a wide range of backgrounds. They were recruited through social media, online forums, and a university research platform. Importantly, participants did not need a formal ADHD diagnosis to be included in the study. Instead, they completed a widely used ADHD self-report scale that allowed the researchers to categorize them based on their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed validated questionnaires that measured their orgasmic consistency during partnered sex, their level of sexual assertiveness, and their overall attitudes toward sex. This allowed the researchers to account for variables that are known to influence sexual experiences, such as the ability to communicate sexual needs or personal comfort with sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that ADHD symptomatology in general was associated with slightly lower orgasmic consistency. However, this effect was small on its own. When researchers examined the data by ADHD subtype, the picture became clearer. Women with predominantly inattentive symptoms—those who reported frequent difficulty sustaining attention or being easily distracted—had the lowest rates of orgasmic consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women who experience predominantly inattentive symptoms of ADHD experienced lower rates of orgasmic consistency compared to controls and women who experienced predominantly hyperactive-impulsive or combined subtype symptoms,” Jensen-Fogt told PsyPost. “This puts women with inattentive ADHD at greater risk for the negative outcomes associated with difficulties in achieving orgasm, such as reduced sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and self-esteem, as well as to increased rates of emotional distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, women with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive symptoms actually reported higher orgasmic consistency compared to both women with predominantly inattentive symptoms and those without ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One somewhat surprising finding was that participants who met the study’s criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD had greater orgasmic consistency rates than those in the control group, who did not meet the criteria for ADHD,” Jensen-Fogt said. “This suggests that the hyperactive-impulsive features of ADHD may provide some benefit to achieving orgasm, though additional research is necessary to confirm this finding and explore why this might be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how medication use influenced orgasmic consistency. Interestingly, women who did not currently meet the threshold for ADHD symptoms—but who reported taking medication typically prescribed for ADHD—had higher orgasm consistency than non-medicated women without ADHD symptoms. This suggests that medication may help manage symptoms that interfere with sexual functioning, although more research is needed to understand the role of specific medications and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor the researchers explored was sexual orientation. Among women without ADHD symptoms, those who identified as sexual minorities—such as lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual—reported higher orgasmic consistency than heterosexual women. However, this difference was not found among women with ADHD symptoms. This raises interesting questions about how sexual behavior, partner dynamics, and neurodiversity intersect to shape sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including a large and diverse sample, with participants from a range of ethnic backgrounds, education levels, and sexual orientations. The study was also pre-registered, meaning the researchers made their analysis plan public before collecting data. This improves the credibility of the findings by reducing the risk of biased or post-hoc interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are limitations. ADHD was identified through self-reported symptoms, not clinical diagnoses, and medication details were not collected. The study focused only on partnered sex involving clitoral stimulation, excluding solo sexual activity. Importantly, the findings are correlational, meaning they show associations but cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our finding of increased orgasmic functioning among women who report using medication for ADHD symptom management need to be interpreted cautiously,” Jensen-Fogt said. “The types of medications participants used were not recorded; so while there may be some indication that medication for ADHD symptom management potentially ameliorates orgasmic difficulties, much further research is needed to examine the effects of specific types of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term goals for this research include informing educational interventions for women with ADHD and for those struggling with anorgasmia. Further, we hope to engage in further research examining potential differences across other sexual functioning domains based on ADHD subtype. Our hope is to better understand what sexual difficulties are more commonly experienced by women with ADHD so that we may better support them in living sexually healthy and fulfilling lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2489771" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exploring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Symptomatology in Relation to Women’s Orgasmic Consistency&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tina Jensen-Fogt and &lt;a href="https://www.orgasmresearchlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cory L.

Like, maybe you tell yourself you can only eat brown rice and can never make exceptions for white rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up becoming less about healthy eating, which is usually what it starts out as, and more about an unhealthy obsession with food purity or ‘clean eating,’ or ‘proper eating,’” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It messes with your social life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it crosses the line is when it starts to interfere with your activities of daily living,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stress about food interferes with your social engagements, like you turn down plans because you aren’t sure of the food situation, it could be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it impacts your ability to live socially in the world, comfortably, then it’s a problem that you should address,” Auguste added.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up being less about the average person concerned about healthy food, and more just really obsessing about it where it’s almost your personality,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: skynesher via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;skynesher via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Orthorexia, or a preoccupation with healthy eating, is becoming more common in society.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spend lots of time analyzing ingredient lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to check the ingredient lists and nutrition labels on food from time to time, especially if you have an allergy or a specific nutrition goal you’re trying to hit. But, for someone with orthorexia, they may find that they’re “compulsively, all the time, analyzing all the ingredients,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may turn into hours and hours spent meal planning or researching the nutrition of every ingredient that’s going into your food, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you break your food rules, you feel anxious or guilty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the line comes when you start to feel like you’re thinking about [healthy eating] all the time,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you feel like you &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/anxiety" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="have anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68220270e4b01f1185018854" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/anxiety" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;have anxiety&lt;/a&gt; ... you’re nervous about eating something ... and you feel like that more often than not, then that could be a sign that maybe you’re thinking about it too much,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for if you feel guilty after breaking any of your food rules, Heise added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste added that if your thoughts about food are disrupting your mental health at all, you should consider talking to someone. Auguste also said if it interferes with your physical health, it’s absolutely a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if this sounds like you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from either a dietitian or mental health professional, you can determine whether your healthy eating is simply that — or something more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to talk to somebody like a dietitian who specializes in disordered eating, a therapist who specializes in it, who can help you figure out [if this is a problem for you],” Auguste said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians generally take insurance, noted Auguste, and they can help you make sure you’re on the right track with your eating, whether or not you have specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can definitely recover from orthorexia if you have the right support,” said Heise, “so, as soon as you feel those feelings, address it as early as possible so that it doesn’t turn into something that rules your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy eating is a lifelong process and isn’t meant to be perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you eat, your nutrition needs likely differ from your partner’s, your neighbor’s and your favorite social media influencer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don’t put too much stock in social media nutrition trends or what diet a friend is raving about, Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over the latest food trend, focus on realistic goals — “so, not focusing on whether or not a food is clean, but focusing on whether or not you have variety in your meals,” Heise said. “Are you getting a variety of different foods? Are you getting a variety of different nutrients? Because that’s where true nutrition comes in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste said it’s important to let go of all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to eating, which includes rules around following one specific diet or a rigid plan to lose weight. “I have so many patients that do that, and then it’s not sustainable to be 100% all of the time,” Auguste added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when they fall off of the diet, they feel like a failure and give up, she noted. “I feel like that is a downside for somebody with orthorexia, is that you are afraid of letting go of the 100%, and you’re afraid that if you let go, that you fall back into that nothing,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to find the middle ground and remind yourself that you don’t have to be perfect, added Auguste. “You can say to yourself, ‘I usually eat healthy.’ You don’t have to say, ‘I always eat healthy,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use “always” language, you “introduce that concept of failure and judging yourself,” Auguste noted. And it’s perfectly OK, and not a failure, to have that salty snack or sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more practice you can get of letting yourself find the middle, where you’re not ‘always,’ you’re just ‘usually’ doing something, I think the better,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on all of this, have compassion for yourself.

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19h9000m3b77zlywfxk5@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Sure, I was kind of tired and in bad mood all the time, but I chalked that up to a combination of the weather, my general personality, and having to commute to New Jersey three times a week to teach Literature 101 to college freshmen who had never read a book and didn’t intend to start now. My occasional bad moods were not a medical issue, I thought — more like the way I could never figure out how other women were physically able to wear high heels or keep their hair de-frizzed. I’m “built different.” But I do love easy, acquisition-based routes to self-improvement, so I did what any slightly crunchy-granola zillennial with a skin-care routine and four-plus hours of daily screen time might and Googled “depression supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ih000n3b77rcqpqdy2@published" data-word-count="186"&gt;I was aware of the available pharmaceutical treatments, but I was wary, nearly phobic, of psychiatric drugs. Everyone in my immediate family has been highly medicated on a cocktail of ADHD, depression, and anxiety medication for as long as I can remember. I’ve watched the agonizing process of my parents switching medication enough times to see that managing them can be as much of a job as being not depressed. For a while, my dad was on an Elvis-like cocktail of Ritalin for focus and clonazepam to take the edge off. Over the years, as his dosage of one crept up, the other rose to meet it. At their peak, my father, usually a quick-talking latter-day Groucho Marx, started speaking slowly, losing his train of thought. When he decided to taper off his behemoth dose of benzos, it took almost a year of agonizing weaning, exiled from the artificial benzo bliss and sent into an anxious state far worse than whatever the drugs were meant to mask. There’s a reason when you Google “benzo withdrawal” the first result is a large banner for the suicide-prevention hotline.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19jz000o3b77vxsp7lkb@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;To be clear, I do believe in &lt;em&gt;mental health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When I started looking for “depression supplements,” I had been in psychoanalytic therapy for about two years. She was the Platonic ideal of a therapist: an older Jewish woman who wore big wooden beads and worked from an office in the West Village. She pushed me to, as she said, “detangle a web of contradicting and harmful associations I’d made to cope with being a living person.” Also, she worked on a sliding scale and was covered by insurance. She never suggested I go on medication for depression. Actually, she didn’t think I was depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ls000p3b77bkn0mcim@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;Still, I figured the supplements could only help&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; And if they did nothing, then I’d at least enjoy the positive placebo effect of participating in &lt;em&gt;self-care&lt;/em&gt;. Like all the times I’d taken zinc to stop a cold, ingested probiotics for my “biome,” or any other tiny sugar pills found in the homeopathic aisle — I figured losing 20-ish dollars was the worst thing that might happen.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I consulted websites of varying levels of credibility, including Healthline, Goop, and the blog of RFK Jr.’s consigliere, Dr. Mark Hyman, who seems to believe that frequent trips to the sauna and a diet of nuts and berries makes you age backward.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19n7000q3b770skdmv5j@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Some sites suggested classic supplements like vitamin D and fish oil. Others hawked more New Wave “adaptogens” like ashwagandha and “Reishi mushrooms,” powdered panaceas I’d seen for sale at Los Angeles crystal-and-smoothie emporiums like Moon Juice and Erewhon. My favorite skin-care–slash–woo-woo store, CAP Beauty, recommended a $2,000 “BioMat” that “uses a combination of heat and amethyst to drive far infrared rays and negative ions deep into our cells and tissues.” But man cannot persist on vibrations alone, and I was looking for something cheap and expressly &lt;em&gt;mood boosting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ol000r3b77mukudxsz@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;All of the sites mentioned St. John’s wort, which was apparently amazing for “a positive mood.” None said it would cure colds, banish brain fog, or make my joints feel better. I liked that it was specifically&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a supplement helpful for aiding in the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/st-johns-wort#:~:text=What%20Have%20We%20Learned?,ADHD%2C%20and%20seasonal%20affective%20disorder"&gt;mild&lt;/a&gt; to moderate depression. My depression, if anything, was mild to moderate. I just wanted to be in a positive mood all the time. Plus I’d once taken a bath using Susanne Kaufmann’s $65 St. John’s wort bath powder and it made my skin feel slippery-smooth. So I went to Duane Reade and bought a bottle of Nature’s Way St. John’s wort supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon19ru000s3b77mqdjckl1@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;All recommendations for supplements, including classics like vitamin C, include a disclaimer: Speak to your doctor if you’re taking other medication. Well, I wasn’t. A website I consulted said St. John’s wort could make hormonal birth control less effective, but I had a copper IUD. Also I’d never even heard of anyone getting sick from vitamins. So I started taking the dose the bottle suggested. Three caplets, twice a day. I took those dark green pills for five months. Was I in a better mood than usual? I don’t know. Honestly, I tend to have a pretty cheery disposition except for when I have to do things that are irritating, like commuting two hours in the dark. But those five months were spread across the summer, meaning I had access to the healing powers of the sun and the Atlantic Ocean. So when my fourth bottle ran out in early November, I didn’t buy any more.&lt;/p&gt;

I got home around 4 a.m., feeling full of energy. The next morning, I woke up early and cleaned my room while listening to Ethel Merman and Barbra Streisand, singing along to “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” After, I met on Zoom with my psychoanalyst, who was spending extra time upstate for the holiday. We talked about how amazing I felt; our sessions, I said, were definitely working. Then I went down to the small grocery store on my corner to get some lunch. It was lightly snowing, and I felt buoyant in my large goose-down parka. I picked up some chicken noodle soup and a box of chocolate-covered biscuits named after a German philosopher who believed we live in the best of all possible worlds. In the checkout line, I felt a stabbing pain in my lower right abdomen, a sort of one-second period cramp. The woman at the checkout beckoned me over, and I put the soup on the counter. My vision blurred. I felt as if I were in a scene in a war movie when the sound gets cut in the middle of a battle to convey that the soldiers are overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a3g000v3b7725cluz3j@published" data-word-count="143"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aha!&lt;/em&gt; I thought, still feeling in control of everything.&lt;em&gt; I know this feeling.&lt;/em&gt; I’d fainted before, once from dehydration and basically every time I’ve smoked pot. With my vision going, I crouched down into a ball to lessen the impact to my head from the impending fall, then toppled over. A few seconds later, I woke up with five people crowded over me. I live on the Upper West Side, so there were multiple elderly women offering to call me an ambulance. I was fine, I told them, I’d only fainted. The store manager brought me a bottle of water and a small bar of some of the very bad Turkish chocolate I’d always wondered if anyone actually bought on purpose. I sat on a stool, eating the waxy chocolate, feeling better by the second as the blood came back to my head.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a4v000w3b77f3wh45zo@published" data-word-count="137"&gt;But at home, eating my soup, the pain in my lower abdomen started worrying me. Its sharpness earlier was strange, and the fact that it was now totally gone was equally unsettling. I called my doctor’s office, a large practice in Midtown East that typically schedules appointments six months in advance. They said they could fit me in the next day if it was urgent, so I decided to try to relax until then. Except instead I had a full-blown panic attack. My friend who lives nearby came over and decided the best thing to do was have me do some kind of physical exercise so I could “be more in my body.” We put on the Tracy Anderson arm-exercise video and flapped our arms like inelegant birds, a move credited with sculpting the arms of Gwyneth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1a6e000x3b77jrtvra9i@published" data-word-count="184"&gt;The next day, now afraid of leaving the house by myself lest I faint again, I asked my dad to accompany me to my appointment in the Midtown East hospital district. At the doctor’s office, they said my appointment was actually one month from now. That was impossible, but they refused to believe me or let me see anybody. So my dad called his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; cardiologist, whose office happened to be upstairs, and, through the same charm, winning personality, and ability to &lt;em&gt;work the system&lt;/em&gt; that has always made him a favorite with strangers, the cardiologist eventually met us outside on the sidewalk, where he gave me an evaluation. He said that I should have gone to the emergency room after I’d fainted, but that now, since I no longer had the abdominal symptoms, there was nothing really to test. He bet it was an “ovarian torsion,” in which my ovaries twisted around each other and then quickly righted themselves, which was extremely serious, and that if it were to happen again, which he &lt;em&gt;bet it would, &lt;/em&gt;I should go straight to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;

The thoughts &lt;em&gt;Am I dizzy? Am I about to faint?&lt;/em&gt; flooded in nonetheless, leaving me frantic as I attempted to grade 27 undergraduate papers about what makes comedy funny.&lt;/p&gt;

But with the cardiologist’s &lt;em&gt;gentle words &lt;/em&gt;ringing in my ears, I decided to visit the CityMD on my block. The doctor there informed me that I needed to go to the hospital immediately. He said that fainting when accompanied by pain is often a “limb-threatening” illness and that I absolutely needed to be checked by an MRI machine ASAP. Somehow this information put me in a better mood than a medical emergency should have. That there might be a real medical reason for my fainting meant that it could soon come to an end. By the time I got to Mount Sinai, I felt amazing. If I fainted here, I thought cheerfully, they could probe my insides and get down to the bottom of what was going on. But after they ran myriad tests, they told me that the CityMD doctor had no idea what he was talking about. From their tone, I could tell they thought &lt;em&gt;And that’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;why he’s stuck working at CityMD&lt;/em&gt;. The doctor said the only possible emergency she’d have imagined was the small chance I had a life-threatening blood clot in my stomach. I’d have to wait four hours to get scanned. I would be kind of crazy to wait for that, the doctor told me, and if it were her, she’d go home. I felt a bit like Tony Soprano when he screams at the doctors for telling him there’s nothing medically wrong with him. But I had plans in two hours to see my friend Caroline’s concert at Terminal 5, and I was relieved to be able to leave the emergency room, where I saw a lot of people way more fucked up than I was.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1afn00113b77jkxiu6oe@published" data-word-count="190"&gt;At Terminal 5, I was in the VIP section, right next to the speakers. My best friend, who had no idea what was happening to me, bought me a $27 tequila-soda. Everything was right as rain. At the after-party, I celebrated my internal secret victory with a few more drinks. I was outside and normal. Except the next morning, a growing sense of unease crept back in, accompanied by a brand-new ringing in my ears courtesy of the speakers, and a fear that I did, in fact, have the blood clot the doctor at the hospital had warned me about. The fear of fainting had morphed: Suddenly, I had no idea where I was. Actually, I had no idea &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;I was. I felt certain I had to escape the room, the apartment, and my body. Whipped into a frenzy, I FaceTimed my boyfriend, who was Britishly on “holiday” in “Wales” with his “school friends.” Seeing his face somehow reinforced my dissociation. He looked like a stranger, an impostor. I felt locked behind my own face, which I could see in the phone reflection was contorted into a rictus of a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1amm00123b77by1romd7@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;He could sense that something was amiss, and when he asked what was wrong, my response was a terrifying cackle. “What’s &lt;em&gt;wrong? &lt;/em&gt;How can you even ask that?” He gently recommended I go see my parents who lived only a mile away. It was getting dark outside, and various inanimate objects in the sublet apartment had started to appear menacing: the beaded curtain that blocked off the kitchen, the Calder-inspired mobile, the wall clock covered in rainbow plastic spikes. The psychiatrist I would eventually meet with, a panic specialist, explained I had been experiencing the “three D’s of panic disorder,” dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization, and for an unusually long duration.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1aor00133b77zr3l3lwo@published" data-word-count="191"&gt;After I had been on the “three D’s” for five hours, crying and screaming, I took my boyfriend’s suggestion and called my parents. My mom was visiting her brother in Pennsylvania, and my dad was at dinner in midtown with his childhood friend, but he left when he heard the urgency in my voice. I lived then on the tenth floor of a prewar building with an elevator that broke at least twice a month, so my dad got stuck inside the elevator for a half-hour on the second floor. Of course, an elevator is a Faraday cage, so I experienced those 30 minutes as the complete disappearance of my dad from the Earth. When he eventually got out, he climbed eight flights of stairs with his wooden walking stick. He found me shivering and crying and was calm. Having a family history of anxiety and depression, I suppose, means that the family comes equipped with skills to manage anxiety and depression. He sat next to the bed, his thick, knobbled wooden walking stick leaving the soothing impression that he was a Gandalf-like protector. Then he gave me my first-ever Valium.&lt;/p&gt;

No, better. It’s like clean socks and a hot bowl of chili by the campfire after a long day backpacking through mud. It’s like your grandmother brushing your hair after a hot bath. I probably don’t have to explain this particular feeling of well-being, as tens of millions of Americans are legally prescribed benzos every year. Xanax cozy is our hygge&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;an American gemütlichkeit&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt; In the words of Future, I was “welcome[d] to the Xanny family.”&lt;/p&gt;

This seemed to be the right kind of exception. “Hi, I’m sorry to bother you,” I wrote her, “but wanted to tell you I fainted right after our last meeting. Have been in sort of a state of nervousness and occasional panic / crying / freak out since. Went to the doctor who said nothing was wrong with me. But still feel very anxious and tired and freaked out.” We met on Zoom, where my therapist informed me she thought that through our sessions I had dissolved so many of my frameworks and coping mechanisms I’d been left destabilized and was in the process of rebuilding on steadier footing. Though I believe in Dr. Freud and his theories, I was not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1ay700173b774qe1yx7i@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;In any case, I told her, I had to return to teaching the following week and was sure that, in this state, I couldn’t make it to Newark via train. The under-construction Penn Station had become a homeless shelter guarded by military police with AK-47s, in which I was often tapped on the shoulder by some very severely mentally ill people. If I fainted there, what would happen? What if I started hysterically crying in front of my students? So my psychoanalyst referred me to a psychiatrist and said she’d have her call me that day. This psychiatrist was no Dr. Pill-pusher. Instead, she was a gentle Swedish American woman, also a boomer, with long white braids and reading glasses that hung from beaded Croakies. The Western Massachusetts–ness of her array put me immediately at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1azm00183b77cugx04z1@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;She was also an expert in panic disorders and said I looked like I was in severe physical pain. She asked me about anything that could have triggered the panic attacks. Any major life changes? No. Any medical issues? No, aside from the new, imaginary ones. Any changes in medication? This wasn’t adding up for her, she said. She asked me to seriously think about if anything traumatic or different had happened to me. Just as we were giving up, she asked if I’d been taking any vitamins. “Oh, yes,” I said, “St. John’s wort.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b0p00193b7734z5unyo@published" data-word-count="288"&gt;She sported a grave face. “Well, there’s your problem,” she said&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apparently, St. John’s wort is metabolized similarly to an SSRI like Zoloft or Lexapro. When I’d gone off of it abruptly, it was as if I’d quit a high dose of an SSRIs cold turkey. The mystery had been solved, but the misery was nowhere near over. She said that because I was taking an unregulated substance without proper studies or trials regarding cessation, it was impossible to know how long it would take to get back to normal. To feel better, she said, I would absolutely need to take a psychiatric drug. After I refused Zoloft, she decided on a course of Xanax to be taken every four hours to “hold me”; after three months, I’d wean off. One of the things I remember about those first few days, when the worst of the panic attacks had been shut down by the Xanax, but when all I could do was stare blankly at &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, was my deification of Dr. Leo Sternbach, the Polish scientist who had discovered benzodiazepine in a Roche lab in New Jersey in 1956. &lt;em&gt;Thank you, Dr. Sternbach, &lt;/em&gt;I thought as I read his Wikipedia page in the dark. &lt;em&gt;What a miracle you escaped the Nazis in 1941, what a clever doctor you were to accept a fellowship in Zurich so that you were saved and could invent medicine to save me. &lt;/em&gt;I couldn’t stop imagining what it would have been like if I’d had this psychotic break in, say, ancient Greece. Would I have been stuck like this forever? Would everyone have thought I was a seer in contact with Athena or something while really I was having a mental breakdown?&lt;/p&gt;

The triggers were always different. A single bite of chicken once sent currents of panic to my brain at a birthday dinner, leading me to hide in the bathroom of a restaurant. At a crowded weekend matinee of a Norwegian indie film, realizing it might be difficult to leave my central seat to get to the bathroom in case I had a panic attack, I ended up having a panic attack. In these cases, I would then take &lt;em&gt;still more&lt;/em&gt; Xanax, which would take about half an hour to kick in, time I usually spent in some bathroom stall sweating through my shirt like a loser kid in a teen movie.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaon1b36001b3b77kgsdlwu7@published" data-word-count="116"&gt;Eventually, I figured out that if I just simply held the bottle of Xanax — if I just touched the bottle and felt it in my hands — I would remember that I could cancel out any panic attack that was coming. The pill bottle became talismanic, and its contents were crumbled and powdery from being shaken around like a magical maraca. After three months, under the psychiatrist’s supervision, I began to taper down my dosage by a quarter milligram every two weeks. I started the Xanax regimen in late November. Nine months later, in August, I was finally off the daily dosage, and only taking the pills “As Needed,” as it read on the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

RFK Jr. and his MAHA friends peddle “Peptides” and intermittent fasting”; Trump’s nominee for surgeon general wrote a book with a chapter called “Trust Yourself, Not Your Doctor.” Still, recently, I was served some ads by a mommy-earthy fashion designer for a mushroom-adaptogen coffee. Drinking this would supposedly give me more energy and tackle “brain fog,” that eternal bogeyman. And I really considered buying some. Her life looked amazing. I told my therapist about it. She forbade me in the clearest terms from messing around with supplements and seemed genuinely bewildered by my desire to experiment further after what had happened the last time. “Don’t you already feel good?”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;she asked. “And if you don’t, why don’t you want something that’ll actually work?”&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Rage, fatigue, mood swings, memory loss, hot flashes, itchy ears, inability to sleep, loss of libido, hair thinning, depression, weight gain, sore knees, night sweats, incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are all symptoms of perimenopause — or possibly just occupational hazards of midlife.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Generation X and millennials ease into their 40s and 50s, they are ready to shake off the stigma around menopause and the time leading up to it — called perimenopause — in favor of embracing treatment. An army of &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/menopause-tiktok-1.6861886" target="_blank"&gt;influencers&lt;/a&gt; are pushing diet supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/21/2985347/0/en/Menopause-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-27-63-Billion-by-2033-Straits-Research.html" target="_blank"&gt;other products&lt;/a&gt; promising to help women through this phase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But how do you know if you are even in perimenopause?&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Unlike menopause — defined by the cessation of menstruation — perimenopause can be sneaky and hard to pinpoint. There's no one definitive test for it, and disentangling the symptoms from other factors can make it hard to treat. Here's how to sort out your symptoms and consider your treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Be persistent in seeking care, and consider a specialist &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Michelle Rockwell started struggling with sleep, perimenopause was not the first thing her primary care doctor suspected. " They said, 'You're too young," says Rockwell, who is now 40, and started seeking medical care a year ago. "It's easy to discount the symptoms. Doctors will say 'It's just stress or whatever,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rockwell did not dispute that her life was stressful — she was working full time as a forensic scientist, raising a daughter, and competed in powerlifting. But she says something felt drastically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I literally had this feeling of like, I don't know who I am anymore," she says. "I was like, I don't recognize myself. I've since come to figure out that we have these levels of hormones and they affect your brain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rockwell saw two different providers — a primary care doctor and a holistic practitioner — before she found a doctor online who specializes in menopause care. The Menopause Society provides &lt;a href="https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;this online database&lt;/a&gt; of doctors who are trained and certified in treating menopause and perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;After much course correction and fine tuning with a specialist, Rockwell is now using hormone therapy, which she says has helped significantly. " I feel better now than in a long time," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;General practitioners often aren't afforded the time to thoroughly evaluate their patients for perimenopause, says Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director of &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Menopause Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Specialists, she says, not only have more knowledge about this condition but are also not subject to the same time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Accept the uncertainty of it all &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perimenopause is often thought to be a problem of a deficit of estrogen, but that is not necessarily the case, says Christmas. The transition into menopause, she explains, is characterized by fluctuations in hormones, which is why many people's experiences can be inconsistent and rocky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" Perimenopause is the most tumultuous time for many people," says Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once people get through this phase and into menopause, when their ovaries aren't making any estrogen anymore, says Christmas, "many actually feel better."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moreover, she points out, it's impossible to disentangle perimenopause from the overall process of aging, which can be a time of significant physiological change. Add to that the pressures of career, family, caretaking responsibilities, financial stress — and midlife can be a roller coaster of uncertainty and stress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas cautions that a certain amount of acceptance of this chaos is necessary for getting through it. She says some of her patients tell her: "The fact that you told me that these mood swings and this brain fog is real, that I'm not imagining it, that's actually enough for me.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others will go on to pursue treatment options. "Some people have very few symptoms, if any at all," says Christmas, while others "might have every possible symptom that you could think of. Most of us are somewhere in between."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Get tested for other conditions &lt;/h3&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Some clinicians suggest a strategy of first testing for a range of other conditions before considering whether perimenopause is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The 40s are a time in life when a lot of different autoimmune diseases can begin to show up," says Nanette Santoro, a gynecologist in Colorado who treats menopause. Often, she says, other conditions can have similar symptoms to perimenopause — many of them easier to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Quite often I'll do a miniature workup to make sure there's no signs of early diabetes, which happens in this age group," says Santoro. Thyroid problems, she says, can also make an appearance during this time, as can rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, hypertension and fibromyalgia. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/16/796682276/for-some-women-nearing-menopause-depression-and-anxiety-can-spike" target="_blank"&gt;Mental health concerns&lt;/a&gt; like anxiety and depression are also worth considering as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Santoro says she's often more inclined to test for and treat these conditions than she is to measure hormone levels, which isn't necessarily that helpful. " If it's not well timed to the menstrual cycle, you may get misleading tests," she says, "and even then, you still may get misleading tests because they vary from month to month."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Understand treatment options &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy to treat especially troubling symptoms like severe hot flashes and crippling mood swings has been a subject of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;much debate&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades. While many providers who treat menopause say it can be helpful or even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;life changing&lt;/a&gt; for some patients, many stress that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I would love to be able to say that hormone therapy reduces cardiovascular risk or cognitive decline later on in life," says the Menopause Society's Christmas, "or all the miraculous anti-aging properties that people are claiming."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some evidence suggests hormone therapy could have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25754617/" target="_blank"&gt;long-term benefits&lt;/a&gt;, she says, but research is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484309/" target="_blank"&gt;not definitive&lt;/a&gt; enough to recommend it for all women in perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2002, the &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt; study halted hormone therapy among its participants due to concerns about increased cancer risk and stroke. But since then, scientists have reassessed the data and new types of hormone therapy have become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, many experts now say past concerns about these elevated risks &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;were overblown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, says Christmas " it's a low risk, but it's not zero." Clinicians warn that people need to take into account things like family history and other factors for cancer when considering hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy also does not work for everyone.  "I have patients who try hormones for a couple of months and come back and say — we're doing something else," says gynecologist Santoro. Some patients, she says, complain of weight gain, breast tenderness or "all kinds of annoying PMS symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hormone therapy may be especially beneficial for those who reach perimenopause earlier in life. "It has been helping tremendously," said Krista Russell-Adams, who hit perimenopause at the age of 37 and experienced anxiety, brain fog, persistently itchy ears and darkening of skin, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10092853/" target="_blank"&gt;melasma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas says there are other pharmaceutical options that she prescribes patients to address specific symptoms. Frequent, heavy bleeding during periods for example — which can &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/press-releases/are-you-just-tired-or-are-you-menopause-tired" target="_blank"&gt;lead to anemia and fatigue&lt;/a&gt; — can be addressed with birth control or an IUD, which may even stop their periods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think of it as a really nice way of cheating the menopause transition," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Embrace healthy aging habits&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some symptoms associated with perimenopause may have more to do with the aging process.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that in both men and women, there are jumps in aging that happen around the ages of 45 and 60. "A lot of women will notice a change in metabolism," says Santoro. "It's not all menopause."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Because of these changes, says Santoro, it's especially important to double down on healthy habits including diet, exercise — especially resistance training, for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/18/1231552773/protein-diet-muscle-strength-training-muscle-loss-women" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining muscle&lt;/a&gt; — and healthy sleep. " Pretty much what your mother told you — just do more of it," says Santoro.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas advises her patients to "be very meticulous about what we're fueling our bodies with. As we age, we're not getting another one."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who may have been able to "get away with not exercising as much or eating whatever we wanted in our younger years" may have to make some significant changes to maintain health, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Those kinds of behavioral adjustments, she says, can have profound impacts "that just giving somebody a pill" can't match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"They give themselves to anybody without prejudice, which seems like a lovely trait, but at the end of the day there is a reason why the human brain evolved to be a little bit suspicious of a new person. You don't know if that person is there to hurt you or to love you, and they [a person with WS] cannot make that distinction," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the last decade, scientists have learned more about the condition, which is offering a unique window into how some of the traits that make us human – such as kindness, trust, and friendliness – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4326252/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;First off, some facts. Humans have 46 chromosomes, organised into 23 pairs. During sperm or egg development, a process called '&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/genotes/knowledge-hub/meiosis/#:~:text=Recombination,per%20homologous%20pair%20per%20meiosis." class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recombination'&lt;/a&gt; occurs where genetic material is swapped between matching pairs of chromosomes. However in WS, the process &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9437774/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;goes wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole section of DNA from one copy of chromosome seven is accidentally deleted. As a result, people with WS are missing one copy of between 25-27 genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lbcr62.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images Some unpublished research suggests that fruit flies lacking a gene thought to be involved in Williams Syndrome prefer to eat together (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Some unpublished research suggests that fruit flies lacking a gene thought to be involved in Williams Syndrome prefer to eat together (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These genes serve various functions. For example one, ELN, codes for a protein called elastin, which provides flexibility and elasticity to tissues throughout the body. A lack of elastin causes the artery walls to stiffen, leading to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9437774/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lifelong cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt; for people with Williams Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="a-social-gene" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="a-social-gene" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;A social gene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet pinpointing the gene, or genes, responsible for the increased friendliness of people with WS has proved more elusive. One theory is that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01977-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004222019770%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;BAZ1B could have a role&lt;/a&gt; here too. Some neural-crest cells go on to form the adrenal glands, which, through their release of adrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response. It's feasible that people with fewer or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4096361/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;impaired neural crest cells&lt;/a&gt; could produce less adrenaline. This, in turn, could make them less fearful of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Meanwhile, other scientists believe that a gene called GTF2I could be responsible. For example, research has shown that individual animals who lack GTF2I tend to be more social than other members of their species. Unpublished research suggests that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240228/GTF2I-genes-role-in-Williams-syndrome-and-autism-unraveled.aspx" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;fruit flies&lt;/a&gt; who don't have the gene like to eat together. Mice without GTF2I are more likely to approach a second &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0380-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;'stranger' mouse&lt;/a&gt;. Dogs also contain a variant of the GTF2I gene thought to make it less effective, which could explain their overt sociability and friendliness compared to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700398" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, people who have a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21658581/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;duplication of the gene&lt;/a&gt; tend to develop a form of autism characterised by social phobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which GTF2I controls sociability isn't known. The protein GTF2I codes for is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05612-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it helps to regulate the expression of many other genes. One theory holds that the personality profile of WS individuals could be related to an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0380-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;impairment of myelin&lt;/a&gt;, the insulating layer or 'sheath' that wraps around nerves, especially those in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Just like the electrical cable in your house, which is covered by a plastic insulation layer, myelin is crucial for the proper transmission of electrical signals from one neuron to another," says Boaz Barak, an associate professor at Tel Aviv University in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Barak and colleagues recently &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0380-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that not only were mice bred to lack GTF2I more social, but that their neurons contained less myelin. Giving them a drug that improved myelination made their behaviour more like that of other mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Individuals with Williams Syndrome have amazing traits that neurotypical people could learn from – Boaz Barak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As myelin dramatically speeds up the rate at which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(06)02523-1?script=true&amp;amp;code=cell-site" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;electrical signals can travel&lt;/a&gt;, one explanation is that the loss of myelin could lead to slower, sluggish nerve cells. This could explain some of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-024-05222-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cognitive difficulties&lt;/a&gt; faced by people with Williams Syndrome, as well as the poor &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/glia.23868" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;motor skills&lt;/a&gt; associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"What we discovered is that when you don't have GTF2I, the myelination process is impaired, leading to weak communication between the brain regions responsible for fear, and those in charge of social decision-making," says Barak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Intriguingly, a FDA approved drug called clemastine – commonly used to treat allergies – is known to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11064-021-03465-0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;improve myelination&lt;/a&gt;. As brain samples donated by people with Williams Syndrome also show impairments in myelination, Barak and his team plan to repurpose clemastine as a potential treatment for the condition. They are currently assessing its safety and effectiveness in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.baraklab.com/clinicaltrial" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;phase 1 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; – the first stage of testing done on humans – due to complete in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Individuals with Williams Syndrome have amazing traits that neurotypical people could learn from, so their behaviour is not something that we need to correct necessarily," says Barak. "We meet a lot of families and it is common to hear a parent saying, 'I would never change how much love she gives to the world, or I adore how friendly and loving she is.' However what we are trying to do is to develop treatments based on drugs that are already out there for those who want to use them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lbcqkl.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images One theory about why people with Williams Syndrome are so friendly is that they have more neural connections involving reward (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;One theory about why people with Williams Syndrome are so friendly is that they have more neural connections involving reward (Credit: Serenity Strull/ BBC/ Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Barak's lab have also found that mice bred to lack the gene GTF2I also have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05612-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;dysfunctional mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; in their neurons.

"As a result, neurons have trouble meeting their energy needs – they suffer a power outage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result of this, toxic substances build up inside the neurons, potentially preventing them from firing properly, according to Barak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Muotri, on the other hand, believes that the increased friendliness shown by people with WS can be explained by the number of synapses – or connections – in their brains. In 2016, his team took stem cells from the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4995142/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;discarded baby teeth of children with WS&lt;/a&gt;. The cells were then reprogrammed to form neurons capable of forming connections, just like those seen in developing brains. On close examination, the neurons of these lab-grown mini brains were remarkably different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There were more synapses than normal, so the neurons were more branched and made more contacts," says Muotri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19067" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt;, the team also examined post-mortem samples taken from people with WS who had donated their brains to science. The same patterns were observed – the neurons of people with WS were more branched and formed more connections with other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Although Muotri and his team haven't yet unravelled all of the circuits involved, he suggests that it's likely that in WS, the frontal cortex forms more connections with the parts of the brain involved in reward. "When you remember someone or see someone that you like, your brain releases dopamine which creates a good sensation," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think people with Williams Syndrome might have a dysregulation in this neurotransmitter. So when they see a new face, they immediately get a release of dopamine, and they feel good about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the flip side of the coin, the team found that mini brains grown using stem cells from children with autism have fewer neuronal connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We showed that if you lower the expression of the [GTF2I] gene, you make more connections, and if you increase the expression of the gene, you create less connections – which is amazing," says Muotri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As traits like trust, kindness, and friendliness are so important to human survival, Muotri believes that evolution must keep a tight rein on the expression of the GTF2I gene. Humans are a social species, and our very survival rests on collaborating with one another. We need to be able to trust each other to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The specific balance [of GTF2I] is probably quite important, as being too friendly is not a good thing, but not being friendly enough is also not a good thing," says Muotri.

New York State is one of the highest risk states for ticks, which can spread diseases like lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a tick, all you have to do is spend some time outdoors. Upstate University Hospital Doctor Saravanan Thangamani is concerned about the increase in the number of ticks submitted to the lab for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My concern is the rise in the number of ticks and the rise in the number of human interactions," Dr. Thangamani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of ticks submitted to the hospital for review has increased by 200% in 2025 since this time last year. Experts say this could be due to the extended winter seasons and to pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs can easily contract on these bugs in their fur while playing or using the bathroom outside. Then, when they step inside, they can easily pass it off to their owners just with one pet on the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thangamani said he isn't just worried about the increase in ticks. He's also worried about the increase in the pathogens they carry. Some examples are lyme disease or anaplasmosis, a flu-like illness that left untreated can turn to hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Town of Manlius has a proactive approach to addressing lyme disease and the spread of ticks. The town managers the deer population, a frequent source for ticks. This program in the community has run for several years. The managing of the deer population in the area is also to reduce car accidents and protect vegetation on people's property. In 2024, 53 deer were removed from the Town of Manlius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a poll made by the town board, residents have said that they haven't seen many changes to the number of ticks they encouncter. However, they are hopeful the program will have an impact on the community in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSTM</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 09:57:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQYm9ReUcwajZPR1BQMEVhSWpaWEpsVmVHVWo5NE5ldVE5bnFsZlBCblpfbXpBaDl2NFFiTTZtVjRjYnFyVDJyMXRRSFEtVDZ6Y015RXlVWkNjQXRhSk10STg0QWsxTHI1RFN2Q3o1QU42X0M4cnJjSlBGd056bER4Wm9tbjd6NGs3eHhXRlloWUQ2RlNfRHR0NmxueGNJdDhKZm1sbXhwRlljQVVQYUE</guid></item><item><title>专家对三种流行香料的致命风险发出警告-数百万人可能面临风险-每日邮报 | Expert issues warning over deadly risk of three popular spices - millions could be at risk - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOTVcxQkZTWlp0SnZXUnNEUVlVRGxuRmJCa0ZENHpzVWdPLTNhWmhTSDdzdnI4UHRfN1cyM3VDTWx2Qm84SXpVWGE1MFg5R291TVQ0eG1vcDdDUXkxaFZlaFdPRm9GLXRMd1Uza3BlUVIybktqTzA4d2ZySGRGMjVreFJoVS1CNV9kRHE5TnlZZ2x1eVhfcEdycU5qclBhWW0xSW9yRkZpYmJUcE5PcUlyeG1nWHQ3aGRy0gG-AUFVX3lxTFBrX01fSzJBVkdzbVRFRnloQ1FqUEZOQ2tyR0VXUDRoc0ZEYzBwSjhFcmJJaHlWRkI1MjZOTWt0SkFvRXQtazZOOWgxUlE5SFpvdlItMHFaZkZGb0hOem5zUUhBT200cnFyb0tWOUZFWlNJQnBQVXdkUjk2RTZLT3NNWHc0alZqdGZxTzNkcEZvS0NoYkNQSnBGencyMnExQlhaQmdFc2Q4c053N0g3ek5GSWR2V0hOd0xCWUhfYmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three popular household spices used in everything from cakes to curries may make life-saving drugs useless, a medicines expert has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon, turmeric and ginger—said to naturally reduce inflammation and boost the immune system—can affect how the body metabolises a range of drugs, including those used to treat high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-24855800-3162-11f0-95e2-1d6878e0e4d9" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and common infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study found that the main compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, which gives the spice its unique smell and taste, also activates receptors that trigger the body to process drugs much more rapidly, reducing their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While people who sprinkle cinnamon on their porridge should be safe, people who take cinnamon supplements could be at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overconsumption could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective', scientist Shabana Khan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that for some medications, such as blood thinners, the rapid metabolism spurred by cinnamon can exacerbate the drug's effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of aspirin and warfarin, this means a risk of potentially deadly bleeding, according to Professor Dipa Kamdar, a pharmacist from Kingston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cinnamon has previously been associated with reducing inflammation and boosting heart health, but some cheaper varieties could interfere with life-saving medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who take blood thinning medication should be caution when using cinnamon, experts advise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts now say the type of cinnamon matters too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'True' cinnamon, a more expensive version of the spice originating from Sri Lanka, has been linked to a range of health benefits: it's rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, helps regulate blood sugar levels and has even been found to lower the risk of heart disease, according to Dr Kamdar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon bark, however, which is usually found in supermarkets, contains high levels of coumarin, which can cause liver damage in high doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also suggests that cinnamon could interact with other medications, like statins and antidepressants, making them more potent or less effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another household staple with adverse side effects is turmeric, which has previously been linked with liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric has long been lauded for its anti-inflammatory properties, found in everything from immune boosting shots to curries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There's evidence that curcumin [the active ingredient in turmeric] can affect how some drugs are metabolised by interfering with liver enzymes [that process drugs],' Prof Kamdar explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Curcumin is a compound that naturally occurs in turmeric, giving it its bright yellow colour. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Turmeric has also been lauded for its anti-inflammatory properties but experts say it has also been linked with liver failure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that taking multiple supplements at one time carries potential dangers due to unknown interactions that can make prescription drugs more potent or less effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Kamdar continued: 'This means it could potentially interact with antidepressants, blood pressure medications, chemotherapy drugs and certain antibiotics.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In extreme cases, high doses of curcumin taken with black pepper—which helps the body absorb the spice—have been linked to severe liver damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in The American Journal of Medicine, researchers looked at the turmeric-associated liver injury cases recorded in the US between 2004 and 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They discovered 10 cases of liver damage caused by the spice. Five people were hospitalised and one person died of &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548561/"&gt;acute liver failure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 62-year-old woman had no history of liver disease and was taking turmeric root extract for her arthritis. She was also taking tramadol—a strong painkiller—a nasal decongestant for her allergies, and other multivitamins including ginger and vitamin D. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She developed fatigue and nausea followed by jaundice, after taking turmeric once daily for 14 months. She stopped taking the supplement, but her symptoms did not improve and she was listed for a liver transplant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She died within five weeks of the onset of symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors concluded that the liver failure was probably caused by turmeric, which could have interacted with the other medications she was taking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The NHS warns taking herbal supplements could make other medicines trigger unexpected side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Kamdar also speculated that, because turmeric has been found to lower blood sugar levels in animals, it could have the same effect in humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This means it could increase the effects of anti-diabetic drugs or insulin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Additionally, turmeric has been shown to reduce blood pressure, which when combined with blood pressure medications could cause an excessive drop', the pharmacist explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, she stressed: 'As with cinnamon, these effects are most often linked to high dose supplements, not the small amounts used in food.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ginger is another common spice lauded for its anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory effects. But, Prof Kamdar warns, its active compounds could interfere with the body's ability to process medication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some studies suggest high doses of ginger may lower blood sugar, potentially increasing the impact of diabetes medication, risking deadly hypoglycemia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ginger can also act as a mild blood thinner, Dr Kamdar added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'If you're taking medications, especially blood thinners, diabetes medicines, or chemotherapy drugs, it's worth having a quick chat with your doctors or pharmacist before starting any new herbal supplements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'But for most people, using spices in typical culinary amounts is safe. So go ahead: sprinkle, pinch, or dash—just be mindful of what's in your medicine cabinet—and be wary of taking any herbal supplement in high doses.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the NHS, around 350,000 people are prescribed blood thinners every year, putting millions of people who take this medication alongside herbal supplements at risk of potentially deadly bleeding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of people taking anticoagulants is set to rise, following a major NHS drive to rapidly expand their use to help prevent stroke fatalities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, Dr Kamdar warns, that taking these spices in high doses at a regular basis alongside these prescription drugs could have potentially life-threatening side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Also known as &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, the bacteria lives in the intestines and is a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/e-coli-and-foodborne-illness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:common cause of food and water contamination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;common cause of food and water contamination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers looked at 981 colorectal cancer genomes. The patients studied were from 11 different countries, had different risk factors, and experienced both early- and late-onset of the disease. Scientists found that "colibactin leaves behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that were 3.3 times more common in early-onset cases (specifically in adults under 40) than in those diagnosed after the age of 70," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; UC San Diego Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There was also a positive relationship between the countries with a higher number of colorectal cancer cases in younger people and the presence of these mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature, showed that colibactin's damaging effects may silently begin early in a person's life. Colibactin-producing bacteria that enter a child's body may grow inside the colon and cause molecular changes in their DNA, putting them at risk for colorectal cancer decades earlier than has been typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It might not be just about what happens in adulthood—cancer could potentially be influenced by events in early life, perhaps even the first few years," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Ludmil Alexandrov, senior author on the study. "Sustained investment in this type of research will be critical in the global effort to prevent and treat cancer before it's too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this notable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These findings may prove invaluable in addressing the rise of cancer in younger people, an unexpected colorectal cancer patient population until recently. But, while the research didn't focus on environmental concerns, it could also raise questions about how our changing climate might increase health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Climate shifts can increase the spread of colibactin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. Higher temperatures can be conducive to bacterial growth. Meanwhile, heavy rains and flooding can drive water contamination by flushing surface-level pollutants into farms and water supplies and by overwhelming sewage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher amounts of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; contamination following extreme weather events could create higher levels of colibactin exposure. The threats could be even greater in low- and middle-income countries lacking sufficient infrastructure for clean water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about toxins that might harm health?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/stay-safe-from-toxins/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:range of toxins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;range of toxins&lt;/a&gt; in our environment have posed problems for some time.

Francis, a professor of otolaryngology at the Duke University School of Medicine. But &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;55 percent&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. adults have disabling hearing loss when they’re 75 and older. And if hearing loss goes untreated, it can raise your risk of developing conditions like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2813302" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1446262/full" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Fortunately, there are steps you can take to protect your ears.

And the longer you’re exposed, the more likely it is that your hearing will be damaged, said Dr. Dunia Abdul-Aziz, a board-certified otolaryngologist at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Hearing an extremely loud sound, such as an explosion, even once can &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cause permanent hearing&lt;/a&gt; damage. But hearing loss is more often the result of “cumulative exposure that you’ll notice later on in life,” Dr. Abdul-Aziz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;If you want a quick and easy way to raise your heart rate, buy a jump rope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cheap and portable, so you can take it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it offers plenty of benefits, improving your cardio, stamina and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love a fitness challenge and I wanted to experience all these benefits for myself, so I decided to skip a minute a day for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down to see how I got on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-skipping-every-day-taught-me"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What skipping every day taught me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-learned-to-let-go"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned to let go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being fairly fit, the first week of the challenge was difficult and a little painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept whipping my ankles with the rope and felt frustrated (I blame my poor coordination).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-q9XczqsHW9P8hmjSrBszNW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-q9XczqsHW9P8hmjSrBszNW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But focusing on things going wrong seemed to make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I allowed myself to let go and shrug off any notions of possible failure, I had fewer ankle whips and enjoyed myself more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-felt-less-anxious"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I felt less anxious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find exercise is a great mood booster, calming my anxious mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, doing just 60 seconds of jump rope boosted my mood to the same degree as my usual 30-minute strength session or HIIT workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping forced me to focus, which cleared my mind and allowed me to be in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-a-great-tool-for-developing-endurance"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a great tool for developing endurance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump rope is an excellent endurance workout, and over time, I noticed my stamina had improved when I was doing other workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently did a four-hour hike in Wales. It was a challenging route with lots of steep inclines and descents, but I found it easier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, I did another long hilly walk, this time wearing my weighted vest, and it felt great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only right at the end, after two hours of non-stop walking and talking, that I needed a breather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-improved-my-cardio-fitness"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It improved my cardio fitness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a month of skipping every day, I noticed that my heart rate was lower during the skipping than it had been at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a clear sign that my cardio capability has improved, which is good news for my general health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I don't intend to continue skipping every day, I'll definitely use it in my regular workouts and pack my rope with me for my next vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/health-ministry"&gt;Health Ministry&lt;/a&gt; announced that 11 children are hospitalized with measles, three of whom are in a serious condition, as of Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the hospitalized children had been fully vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the measles outbreak, 48 have been hospitalized, 40 of whom have been children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures raise concern within the health system, partly because the amount of reported cases likely only represents a portion of the virus's actual spread among the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior health officials also warn of a potential mass infection at the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/lag-baomer"&gt;Lag Ba'omer&lt;/a&gt; Mount Meron pilgrimage, as vaccination rates in certain haredi (ultra-Orthodox) communities remain very low.&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Highly contagious disease. Child with measles. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry held urgent discussions with representatives from health maintenance organizations, and following consultations, decided to advance the timing of the second measles &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/vaccine"&gt;vaccine dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was previously given to children at six years old, but will now be administered in areas with active cases or heightened outbreak risk, starting from one month after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is measles? Symptoms and treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-851840"&gt;Measles is an acute viral disease&lt;/a&gt;, highly contagious and transmitted through airborne respiratory droplets. Its infection rate is considered among the highest of viral illnesses, with an unvaccinated person exposed to a patient having about a 90% chance of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after infection and include high fever, runny nose, fatigue, conjunctivitis, dry cough, and a characteristic rash spreading from the face to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients recover within a few days, but the disease can complicate into pneumonia, ear infections, liver damage, and rarely, acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months and sometimes years after infection, a severe chronic nervous system disorder called SSPE (Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis) can develop. This is a progressive, incurable degenerative disease marked by cognitive decline, movement disorders, neurological seizures, and death. SSPE’s estimated incidence is about 1 in 10,000 cases, but the risk is significantly higher in infants under one year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include decreased consciousness, vomiting, light sensitivity, and neck stiffness&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Cases of the measles rise in Israel. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing dedicated vaccination centers nationwide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Health Ministry opened dedicated vaccination centers nationwide that allow walk-in immunizations without appointments. The ministry urges the public to check the list of centers on its website and to arrive up to 30 minutes before closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of children under six are asked to complete the vaccination series with the “Tipat Halav” (maternal and child health clinics), while children over seven can be vaccinated at the new centers or health funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is included in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) combination and is generally administered in two doses: at one year and six years of age. However, due to the current outbreak, the ministry is advancing the second dose in defined areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults born after 1957 who are unsure of their vaccination status are asked to check their records and complete vaccination if necessary. The ministry notes that people born before 1957 are generally considered immune, having likely been exposed to the virus during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women who are unvaccinated, infants, and immunocompromised individuals may also require passive immunization with antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors worldwide have noted a decline in vaccination rates since the COVID-19 pandemic, a trend affecting Israel as well. Avoidance of routine vaccinations combined with rising vaccine skepticism has created susceptible populations lacking immunity, leading to recurring measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and adults unsure of their vaccination status can contact their health fund nurse or the Health Ministry’s hotline by dialing *5400. The ministry also recommends that any traveler abroad who has not received two measles vaccine doses get vaccinated as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to recognize signs of measles infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measles infection often begins with a seven to 14-day incubation period. General symptoms during the first stage of infection include a high fever, runny nose, severe fatigue, dry cough, and eye inflammation. During the second stage, more unique symptoms, such as small white spots on a red background inside the cheeks, known as Koplik spots, sometimes appear before the rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third stage is the rash appearing, including a dense red rash starting on the face, before spreading to the neck, torso, arms, and legs. The rash often lasts between four and seven days, and may be accompanied by significant weight loss and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible complications from a measles infection include pneumonia, ear infections, diarrhea, and acute encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avihai Chiim contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We talked about the Manet exhibition we had just seen at the National Gallery. We probably talked about how the end of the cold war might affect the chances of Bill Clinton winning the presidential election against George HW Bush in November. I know what John thought about that. I only wish I could recall his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The next morning, 30 July 1992, John got up before me as he always did. In the kitchen I found the contents of the dishwasher – knives, forks, spoons, plates, mugs – jumbled together on the table. This was odd because unloading the dishwasher was the one domestic ritual he willingly performed. It would be years before I learned the reason. At the time I put it down to absent-mindedness. It was a month since he had delivered a book to the publisher and he was already preoccupied by the next one, about art in the European Renaissance. Before I had time to be annoyed, I heard a crash from his study at the top of the house. I ran upstairs and found him lying on the floor next to his desk. He looked up at me with the radiant, witless smile of a baby. And he said: “Da walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/stroke","type":"Keyword","title":"Stroke"},{"id":"news/series/the-long-read","type":"Series","title":"The long read"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/physiotherapists","type":"Keyword","title":"Physiotherapists"},{"id":"science/neuroscience","type":"Keyword","title":"Neuroscience"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/the-long-read","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"The Long Read"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/long-read","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Long Read"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/may/15/husband-son-stroke-30-years-apart-treatment","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"prebidCriteo":true,"abPrebidId5":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"europeBetaFrontTest2":false,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"dcrJavascriptBundle":false,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"abA9BidResponseWinner":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"lineItemJobs":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":false,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ambulance took us to the local hospital where they said that my husband had had cerebral accident – a stroke. The cause was probably years of uncontrolled high blood pressure, about which no doctor had warned him. They said he needed rest and reassurance. Unfortunately, because of the so-called efficiency savings introduced by John Major’s government, there was a shortage of beds and of nurses in all London hospitals. I was so grateful when they found a bed for him in a geriatric ward later in the day that I didn’t at first notice how filthy it was and how hot. The floor was covered in urine, blood and dust balls. (Later I brought in a mop to clean around John’s bed.) The plateglass window could not be opened: to prevent suicides, a passing nurse told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was a week before I managed to track down the doctor whose name was printed on a grimy card at the head of John’s bed. The doctor informed me that my husband’s case was hopeless. He would never walk again and must never be allowed to try to stand because the hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall. Physiotherapy, which the doctor considered “about as useful as peanut butter”, was out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;You learn fast in an emergency. John had had an ischaemic stroke, which is a blockage in one of the arteries that carries blood to the brain, resulting in the death of brain tissue. It was in his left brain, which controls the right limbs and, in most people, the processing of language. About 75% of people will survive a first stroke. But it is essential to get them up and standing as soon as possible, and paralysed limbs should be moved to prevent the muscles from seizing up permanently. Visiting family and friends were happy to help, moving John’s arms and legs while they sat with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;John greeted everyone with those two meaningless syllables, &lt;em&gt;da walls. &lt;/em&gt;He also used the same sounds to ask them questions about themselves: “Walls? Da walls?” He chatted away in his usual sociable manner with his fellow patients, and even charmed the few overworked nurses. The rise and fall, the rhythms and pitch of his voice were so normal that those of us who knew him well understood at least the gist of what he was not saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since he could read, we assumed he could also write; he was after all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/13/guardianobituaries1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a writer.&lt;/a&gt; We gave him a piece of paper and a ballpoint pen, which he seized in his good left hand, and, on the top left corner of the page he wrote the letter “f” and then gave up. John had what is called expressive aphasia. Although he could tell that we didn’t understand him, it felt to him as though he was translating his thoughts as effectively and comprehensibly as ever into words. I was only one of the many people who had a recurring dream that John had suddenly started to talk normally. As one friend said, it was as if he were under a magic spell and, like all magic spells, it would be lifted as suddenly as it came on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he neurologists and clinicians who specialise in stroke talk a lot about pathways. There are the pathways of neurons and synapses that are interrupted by a clot or haemorrhage, pathways from the onset of symptoms to hospital. Although the consequences of a stroke do not necessarily get worse over time, the pathway to recovery is problematic, as I was to discover. My own pathway towards an understanding of what stroke is and does, and how it can be addressed, began in that unclean geriatric ward where the doctor condemned his stroke patients to live diminished lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My concern at the time was to escape from that hospital to a place that would help my husband. The Wolfson neurorehabilitation centre at Atkinson Morley hospital in Wimbledon, which had an excellent reputation for stroke rehabilitation, did not admit patients over 65 on the NHS. They would, however, accept John privately – at a price that would have meant selling our house. With some difficulty, I found a bed in a hospital at the other end of London. It was at least clean. And although there was no physiotherapy available, the nurses, immediately on John’s arrival, got him up on his feet and limping, with their support, up and down the ward. All too soon they informed me that they would have to discharge him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then I found that John’s service in the second world war entitled him to a place in the Royal Star &amp;amp; Garter for Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen. A large and handsome building, overlooking the Thames from the brow of Richmond Hill, it had been purpose built for the care and rehabilitation of servicemen and women disabled in the first world war. (It has now, perhaps inevitably, been converted into luxury flats.) It was staffed by neurophysiotherapists, occupational therapists and a speech therapist. The physios worked on restoring not just movement of the affected limbs but movement that was as normal as possible. The physios walked him through parallel bars, guiding his bad leg into a correct position with their hands, running their hands up his spine to remind him to stand up straight. They got him to put his full weight on one leg while swinging the other. They made him do squats, holding his limp arm stretched forward with his good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b7e2c45e-863c-4c3c-b3a8-93733aa182d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sheila and John Hale. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sheila Hale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When John came home at Easter after six months of intensive physiotherapy, he was able to dress himself and care for his personal needs. He was still limping but he was so much stronger that he walked around the house without a stick and climbed the stairs to his study. He was, however, liable to trip and fall because he had no control over his right foot. Then I heard, only by chance, that a rigid brace fitted on his foot underneath the shoe would solve that problem. Now he began to take himself on ever longer walks around the neighbourhood, chatting in those meaningless syllables with the neighbours, making new friends in the pub. We travelled, to Italy and farther afield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ix months after the stroke, John’s vocabulary had not changed, and I was determined to find out how he might recover his use of language. The speech therapist at the Star &amp;amp; Garter had quickly given up on John: “You will never again have a conversation with your husband.” Her patronising pronouncement filled me with an energising rage that set me on a new pathway: to find out as much as I could about aphasia, and to prove her wrong about John’s case. My instinct as a journalist was to seek out expert specialists in the field; and I was not surprised to discover that the more experienced they were, the less likely they were to make predictions about John’s, or anyone else’s, chances of recovery. The people who know most about the way the brain works know that it is terra incognita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="39b2b35f-a50d-48df-acf0-d888e43e8206" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;John Hale in Venice, February 1992.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Quill&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I found two speech therapists, Jane Marshall and Eirian Jones. Watching them work with John taught me so much about language, and what the loss of it tells us about normal language, that I began to plan a book about the condition (which is better known as dysphasia, rather than aphasia, because it is rare that all the elements of language are lost). I will mention here only one of Jones’s many discoveries about John’s particular case because it explains the mystery of the way he unloaded the dishwasher on the morning of his stroke. Jones’s theory was that John had lost the ability to “disambiguate” the various different contents of the dishwasher. And in the same way he could no longer unravel the elements of a sentence. So although John could write individual words, matching the correct word to a picture or filling in the missing word in a story, he had, as Jones put it, no idea of what a sentence was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On 13 September 1998, six years after the stroke, there was a stupendous breakthrough. John indicated to me that he wanted to write a thank you note to a friend who had given us lunch in his office. He got out one of his correspondence cards headed Professor Sir John Hale, and on it he wrote: “Dear David”. I said, Fine, now what is the expression of gratitude you need? John wrote: “Thanks you for lunch.” I said: Do you want to say where? John wrote: “in your office”. When? “On Thursday.” Then he wrote without prompting: “I have”. And I stupidly said, now you need either a verb or a noun. But he wrote “certainly” and laughed and finished the letter by himself: “been in luck! Yours ever, John.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I telephoned Eirian with the news. She was pleased but reminded me that it wasn’t quite the breakthrough I had initially thought – I had, in fact, guided John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went to the US to research my book on dysphasia. Back home I told John about all the people I had interviewed, one of them being Alfonso Caramazza, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Harvard. On 9 August 1999, I went out shopping. When I returned I found on John’s desk a scrap of paper on which he had written:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-w9py1s"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dear Caramagne,&lt;br&gt;
  I will thanks you for agreeing to advice Sheila to carre on.&lt;br&gt;
  With best,&lt;br&gt;
  John Hale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next to the draft was one of his correspondence cards on which he had written (note the style, one professor to another):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-w9py1s"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dear Caramazza,&lt;br&gt;
  I will thank you for agreeing to advise Sheila to carry on.&lt;br&gt;
  With best,&lt;br&gt;
  John Hale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nobody was with him. Nobody prompted or guided him or even suggested he write to Caramazza, about whom I hadn’t spoken for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I will never know how much more John would have written, because on the morning of 12 August he died peacefully in his sleep next to me in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;y book, The Man Who Lost His Language, was published in 2003. For the third edition in 2006, the publisher asked for a new chapter about any recent changes in stroke care. All my contacts led me straight to one man: Dr Tony Rudd, consultant stroke physician at St Thomas’ hospital in central London. Rudd was better known in medical and government circles as “Dr Stroke” for his tireless campaigning to get the message across that stroke, like heart attack, is both a medical emergency and a treatable illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I asked him what changes he had seen in the 14 years since John’s stroke. “There has been more progress with stroke than with any other illness,” he said. “But we started from nothing. And there are still black holes.” The failure to treat stroke properly from day one continued to be a massive waste of public money. Without treatment, the survivors will be a burden on the NHS and the welfare budget. It is not only they who will remain helpless and unproductive. Their carers, usually unpaid younger relatives, will also be unable to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But lassitude was giving way to excitement with the development of techniques which restore the flow of blood to the brain (known as reperfusion), in time to limit much of the damage caused by ischaemic stroke. Rudd had begun a programme of injecting suitable patients with a clot-busting drug. The technique, thrombolysis, is by no means suitable for every stroke. And because brain cells die in their millions during a stroke, treatment should be delivered as soon as possible, preferably within four hours. Thrombolysis was first used in the UK in the 1990s. Rudd’s hospital was the first that was equipped to deliver it to all suitable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A cheerful young Scottish nurse told me that whereas stroke used to be “the dead end of nursing”, the opportunity to give quality care to people who might otherwise have died or been permanently disabled was so rewarding that she had decided to devote her career to caring for stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I went away that day daring to hope that stroke treatment, which was underserved by an underfunded, over-bureaucratised health system, might receive the attention it deserved. In 2010, following recommendations by Lord Ara Darzi, eight specialised services for stroke treatment, known as Hyper Acute Stroke Units, were established across London. Six years later, St George’s hospital in Tooting, south London, was the first of them to perform thrombectomy, which mechanically removes clots too big to respond to clot-busting drugs. This continues to be the most effective procedure and allows almost half of those treated to return to their normal life within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t 11:10am on Sunday 21 November 2021 I had a telephone call from my daughter-in-law Amanda. My son Jay, who was then 55, had fallen out of bed earlier that morning. Amanda knew it was a stroke because Jay had inherited his father’s high blood pressure, along with his insouciance about his health. She rang 999 only to be told that there would be no ambulance for four hours. A kind neighbour who is, as it happened, a doctor drove them through red lights to the nearest stroke unit. Amanda was informed that Jay was not a suitable candidate for reperfusion because the stroke had happened in his sleep and they couldn’t therefore determine whether too much time had elapsed for treatment to be effective. This was incorrect. Since Jay went to sleep at 11pm and reached the unit by 4:30am he was in good time. No doubt the hospital was overwhelmed by Covid. What happened afterwards, however, was less forgivable; nor, alas, is it an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dfb9e2da-0a36-4586-bc89-87077e590720" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jay Hale.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sheila Hale&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jay was given a bed in a dedicated stroke ward. It was immaculately clean. (The lesson of the MRSA epidemics in dirty wards had been learned.) His was a right-brain stroke paralysing his left arm and leg and affecting his left field of vision, but sparing his language. The consultants who visited him in the ward predicted, presumably on the evidence of a brain scan, that he was unlikely to walk again. Although Jay was fully conscious and able to speak normally, the consultants also informed him that he would never work again. He must under no circumstances be permitted to stand up without the help of physiotherapists, who were scarce and clocked off at 4pm. The hospital insurance wouldn’t cover a fall and private physiotherapy was not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without the support of his family and many friends Jay might well have given in to the despair that afflicts so many stroke survivors. He couldn’t believe what had happened to him. But he was also determined to prove that the doctors were mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike his father all those years ago, Jay was allowed small doses of physio and occupational therapy every now and then. When they had time, the physios put him on a reclining static bicycle which he enjoyed because he had always been a keen cyclist, and which encouraged him to move the bad leg by pumping with the good one. After a few weeks, he charmed two of the physios into helping him to stand up and take a step, then two steps, then walk the length of the ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Jay was discharged after four months in hospital he mostly used a wheelchair, although he was able to walk around the house with a four-legged stick. He had been warned by the hospital that he must never, ever rely on a single stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Amanda enrolled him in a private rehabilitation practice in west London run by a renowned physiotherapist named Richard Sealy. Sealy asked Jay what he wanted most to achieve, and when Jay said he wanted to walk without a stick Sealy said: “Well then do it.” Jay took a few steps. In 25 years of practice Sealey has treated 4,000 patients, including the journalist Andrew Marr after his stroke. Over the next 18 months, I watched this charming and dedicated man and his team of neurophysios and occupational therapists working with Jay to reconnect the pathways between the motor cortex of his right brain with his left leg and arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;First, they got him to walk chest forward and head up – with, and then without, a stick. They tried to play football as a way of encouraging an instinct to kick. He tried to put weight and balance on his bad leg and kicking with the good one; or, and this was much harder, balance on the good leg and kick with the bad one. He did one-legged squats. He used a pilates reformer and walked on a treadmill. They timed him as he walked as fast as he could around the building, each time beating his previous record. In an attempt to wake up his left hand and arm they clasped the hand around his precious phone, hoping to trigger the instinctive grasp to stop it dropping. They tried video games played with his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By no means everybody could afford Sealy’s fees (£110 for 45 minutes). Sealy regrets leaving the NHS, where he was trained and which he says still provides the best training for physiotherapists in the world. If there is a shortage of neurotherapists in the NHS, he said, the reason they leave is less about pay than about the long hours of intensive therapy they are not allowed to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I remain haunted by the people who miss out on precious rehab. Each one of &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1.3 million stroke survivors&lt;/a&gt; in the UK has a story. Last year there were &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/11/hospital-admissions-for-strokes-rise-by-28-since-2004-as-nhs-urges-the-public-to-act-fast/#:~:text=NHS%20England%20data%20shows%20an,on%20the%20nation's%20cardiovascular%20health." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;111,137 stroke admissions to NHS hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, a rise of 28% in 10 years, and this &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/26/unsustainable-uk-predicted-to-see-50-spike-in-strokes-by-2035" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;figure is expected to rise&lt;/a&gt; dramatically. Meanwhile, 39% of stroke patients are abandoned by the NHS after six months. A third remain too disabled to work, many because they believed, or had no choice but to believe, the doctors who wrote off their chances of recovery. The population of stroke survivors is as big as that of a large city, and it’s getting bigger. More than half are left with a disability and about a third are unable to live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nor, as many young people like to imagine, is stroke a faraway illness that happens in the never-never land of old age. A quarter of people who experience strokes are under the age of 65. And in the past 10 years there has been a 55% increase in strokes among people, like my son Jay, in their 50s, which is the highest increase among any age group. The reasons may be bad diet – ultra processed food and especially sugary drinks, which are as dangerous as smoking – and uncontrolled blood pressure. The poorest members of society suffer strokes seven years earlier than the better off. Some are small strokes. They may recover spontaneously in a few weeks but even small strokes may be warnings of worse to come. Many will have lost the use of an arm and a leg, a field of vision, the production or comprehension of language. They might suffer from apraxia, an inability to sequence movements in the order it requires to perform everyday tasks. Some will find it difficult to recognise what they see, touch, hear or taste, an impairment of sensory processing known as agnosia. Visual agnosia was made famous by Oliver Sacks in his classic book &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/oct/17/profile-oliver-sacks-author-neurologist" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/a&gt;. Others will suffer from anosognosia, a denial of their own symptoms. Every stroke is different and every brain has been conditioned by a unique set of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5f442e65-69d8-4201-b11d-d67a6500a923" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&amp;quot;richLinkIndex&amp;quot;:43,&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;prefix&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Related: &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;'Is anybody in there?'

For those who need an economic justification, a 10-year study published in 2016 and led by Prof Lynne Turner-Stokes at King’s College hospital has demonstrated that intensive therapy for all neurological illnesses saves the cost of long term care and improves the rate of productivity. This is why the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) now recommends a minimum of three hours of intensive therapy at least five days a week. Yet at present, most NHS stroke units provide two or three hours of physiotherapy a week, with a six-month time-limit. Nick Ward, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, an ardent defender of rehabilitation after stroke, described this as “a homeopathic dose, not worth the cost”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why does the UK waste lives and taxpayers’ money by condemning stroke survivors to dependent, unproductive lives? Three and a half years after his stroke, my son is a living example of what can be achieved by physiotherapy, and why it is so important that more people have access to it. The hole in his brain is much bigger than it would have been if he had been treated on arrival at the stroke unit, instead of being told he was not eligible. Nevertheless, thanks to intensive neurophysiotherapy, Jay now climbs up and down two flights of stairs to their bedroom at the top of the house. He dresses and washes himself, walks around the house without a stick, around London with only a single stick, gets on and off buses and trains. He has returned to teaching mathematics, five days a week, at the school where he worked before the stroke. He swims at the local gym, where he has taught the personal trainer some of the techniques of neurophysiotherapy. Not only does he lead an independent and productive life, he is still, three and a half years post-stroke, getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPY1c0NURmVmROY1hkUkV4LXNzZ0pvXzREemI3ckZadC03T1REQXdEVk9QOHJ4TXlHM0JKMEFmREItd0ZmY1Zsa0p3Q3l0a2xWTHlMVG1uOXNlSXpjcENQUnVpX2N6QnpIalFJcDJDMmxxRGtWaW1RallieG1tYTkzYzAzN2ktbmJFWklsRG8waWtOcDZfSWc</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，由于全球变暖，登革热和基孔肯雅热可能很快在欧洲流行-法国24 | Dengue and chikungunya may soon be endemic in Europe due to global warming, research shows - France 24</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPaGNybVlOOVdlcURqSVFUOExQVTVYbTBZMXBKYmxVQkRKd19VZ0szeHdnTlVRekZlcXo1QTZJZWxDeUg2QjZiRVN5ajR6elA3VzhRWXFWaUplQUVnVHJLWnJid0loVDU1WEJqNkJaV2Q0a21VMUFGS0lzUEhYTG9FOF85RzYxdHZqaHhwaEpSODVTakxraHYwVDBEaUsxYVRVN0ZtbEQwMjJtSFVXcTZUSHg3dEp2RUs0MXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="a-loader-error__content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity costs the UK an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/everybody-active-every-day-a-framework-to-embed-physical-activity-into-daily-life"&gt;£7.4 billion each year&lt;/a&gt; – but more importantly, it costs lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today's increasingly sedentary world, sitting too much is raising the risk of many serious diseases, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161435" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But could something as simple as walking offer real protection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the answer may be yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27183032/"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that regular physical activity can lower the risk of cancer. Now, &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/14/bjsports-2024-109360"&gt;recent findings&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Oxford add more weight to that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a large study involving over 85,000 people in the UK, the more steps you take each day, the lower your chances of developing up to 13 different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, participants wore activity trackers that measured both the amount and intensity of their daily movement. On average, researchers followed up with participants six years later. They found a clear pattern: more steps meant lower cancer risk, regardless of how fast those steps were taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits began to appear at around 5,000 steps a day – anything below that didn't seem to offer much protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 7,000 steps, the risk of developing cancer dropped by 11%. At 9,000 steps, it dropped by 16%. Beyond 9,000 steps, the benefits levelled off. The difference in risk reduction became marginal, and varied slightly between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support the popular recommendation of aiming for 10,000 steps a day – not just for general health, but potentially for cancer prevention too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations also held up when results were adjusted for demographic, BMI and other lifestyle factors, such as smoking, suggesting that the observed changes in cancer risk were indeed down to the average number of daily steps a participant took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-642x428.jpg" alt="Older women walking together outdoors." class="wp-image-161443 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Walking 5,000 to 9,000 steps per day can cut cancer risk. (Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step intensity was also analysed – essentially, how fast participants were walking. Researchers found that faster walking was linked with lower cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when total physical activity was taken into account, the speed of walking no longer made a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="161435" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; difference. In other words: it's the total amount of walking that counts, not how brisk it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, replacing sitting time with either light or moderate activity lowered cancer risk – but swapping light activity for moderate activity didn't offer additional benefits. So just moving more, at any pace, appears to be what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 13 specific cancers, including oesophageal, liver, lung, kidney, gastric, endometrial, myeloid leukaemia, myeloma, colon, head and neck, rectal, bladder and breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the six year follow-up period, around 3% of participants developed one of these cancers. The most common were colon, rectal, and lung cancers in men, and breast, colon, endometrial, and lung cancers in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher physical activity levels were most strongly linked to reduced risk of six cancers: gastric, bladder, liver, endometrial, lung and head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Break it up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have relied on self-reported activity logs, which can be unreliable – people often forget or misjudge their activity levels. This study used wearable devices, providing a more accurate picture of how much and how intensely people were moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also stands out because it didn't focus solely on vigorous exercise. Many past studies have shown that intense workouts can reduce cancer risk – but not everyone is able (or willing) to hit the gym hard. This new research shows that even light activity like walking can make a difference, making cancer prevention more accessible to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking just two miles a day – roughly 4,000 steps, or about 40 minutes of light walking – could make a significant impact on your long-term health. You don't have to do it all at once either. Break it up throughout the day by: taking the stairs instead of the lift; having a stroll at lunchtime; walking during phone calls; parking a bit further away from your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting more steps into your routine, especially during middle age, could be one of the simplest ways to lower your risk of developing certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the link between physical activity and cancer is complex. More long-term research is needed, especially focused on individual cancer types, to better understand why walking helps – and how we can make movement a regular part of cancer prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, the message is clear: sit less, move more – and you could walk your way toward better health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255564/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

They are commonly used for pain relievers, multivitamins, stool softeners, and cough and cold medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unknown how many Americans take such capsules, the US soft gel capsules market was valued at $2.14 billion in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top heart doctor has revealed the insidious chemical in medicine capsules that could increase your risk of a heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'Phthalates [can] increase inflammation and an important risk for heart disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 Environmental Pollution study found phthalate exposure was associated with a slightly higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the urine samples of 5,300 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 years old from 2001 to 2010 and tracked causes of death among.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed among the 100,000 people who died during the study period, the ones with higher levels of phthalates in their urine were more likely to have died from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted further research is needed to understand the exact ink between phthalate exposure and heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Dr Levine, exposure to phthalates - especially through pills - can cause swelling and irritation in&lt;span&gt; the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can lead them to narrow or harden, potentially causing blockages or aneurysms - ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by the buildup of cholesterol and other substances, forming plaques, along the artery walls, but excessive intake of phthalates can also lead to this inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Softgel capsule shells are made of phthalates - making it easier for manufacturers to mold the capsules into their own desired shape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim the chemicals also cause oxidative stress, a type of cell and tissue damage caused by an imbalance of molecules in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to damage in the heart cells, which can impair their function and contribute to inflammation, as well harden artery walls - increasing the risk for a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, phthalates can negatively impact cholesterol levels and potentially increase levels of triglycerides - a type of fat known to cause heart attacks - and low-density lipoproteins in the organ - making a person more susceptible to strokes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While radon gas is known to cause lung cancer, an 18-year, 700-plus county &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969724064441?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Oregon State University found a link between exposure to radon gas and childhood leukemia rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Imperial College London and the Environmental Protection Agency, found the link even at radon concentrations lower than the Environmental Protection Agency's mitigation threshold. Counties in Utah were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 3,000 children receive a leukemia diagnosis per year in the U.S. There hasn't been a study on risk factors for cancer among children and the role the environment plays. Lead epidemiologist Matthew Bozigar from Oregon State University wanted to see if radon exposure could be one of the risk factors for childhood leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We are working on many different radon studies, and we are continuing to find harmful effects not limited to the lungs in adults." &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Matthew Bozigar, Oregon State University epidemiologist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an epidemiologist, I started considering possible environmental causes and connected with awesome collaborators who provided important data and other resources to enable innovative new analyses," Bozigar explained to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240930212851.htm" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that children who were exposed to a radon concentration of 2.0 pCi/L or higher had an 8 percent higher risk of leukemia for both males and females and a 12 percent higher risk for females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put that in perspective, the average indoor radon concentration in Utah is 4.5 pCi/L, two and a half times higher than the study's concentration threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon is odorless and colorless, the only way to detect it is to test for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the U.S. Surgeon General, the Environmental Protection Agency and many others encourage every homeowner to test regularly (typically every two years). UtahRadon.org is offering one &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/?nab=0#radon-test-form" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;free test kit &lt;/a&gt;for each Utah household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Children who were exposed to a radon concentration of 2.0 pCi/L or higher had an 8% higher risk of leukemia for both males and females and a 12% higher risk for females. (Photo: PeopleImages)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More studies to come&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study shows a statistically significant link between radon exposure and childhood leukemia, Bozigar said it's only a start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study design only allows us to identify statistical associations and to raise hypotheses, so studies that can better determine whether radon exposure causes childhood leukemia are needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Bozigar said, "We are working on many different radon studies, and we are continuing to find harmful effects not limited to the lungs in adults. We will have more to share in the coming months and years as our studies are published."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is a radioactive gas that can't be seen, smelled, or tasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is created when uranium in the ground decays and Utah has high levels of uranium around the state. One in three Utah homes has dangerous radon levels — and those numbers may be undercounted due to infrequent testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The second leading cause of lung cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon causes 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year — and thousands more diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon goes undetected by our senses and because lung cancer symptoms are often initially mild, most people do not get diagnosed until the disease has significantly progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do to protect your loved ones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon-induced lung cancer can almost entirely be avoided if Utahns are proactive in testing for radon in their homes. Leading health organizations recommend testing for radon every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/?nab=0" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org &lt;/a&gt;makes testing your home easy and provides &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/?nab=0#radon-test-form" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;one free test for every Utah home&lt;/a&gt;. The test kit includes shipping, the test, lab fees, and the analysis. There is no cost to test your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it.

			&lt;p&gt;The setup for &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; video game and TV series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLNagvJHl3g"&gt;involves a fungus&lt;/a&gt; that evolves due to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="160766" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; to infect swathes of the human population, turning people into killer zombies – and at least part of that story is eerily plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are raising concerns about the increasing spread of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt; fungi&lt;/a&gt;, helped along by climate change and warmer temperatures. These types of fungus don't turn people into zombies, but they can cause severe health issues and even fatalities in people, plants, and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, researchers in the UK show how three species – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_fumigatus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_flavus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – are likely to spread further north between now and 2100, based on their existing habitats and climate models predicting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-map-reveals-the-predicted-future-climate-where-you-live"&gt;future warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160769" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160769" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps.jpg" alt="Fungi spread" class="wp-image-160769 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps-617x415.jpg 617w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WorldMaps-600x404.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160769" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers modeled the spread of the fungus worldwide. (van Rhijn et al., &lt;em&gt;Research Square&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in environmental factors, such as humidity and extreme weather events, will change habitats and drive fungal adaptation and spread," &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/climate-change-putting-millions-more-people-at-risk-from-infection-causing-fungi/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; environmental mycologist Norman van Rhijn, from the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="160766" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the severe climate scenario, the spread of &lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/em&gt; in Europe could increase by 77.5 percent in 15 years, putting 9 million more people at risk of infection. For &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt;, which favors hotter areas, the spread might be as much as 16 percent in Europe, putting an extra 1 million people at risk. For &lt;em&gt;A. niger&lt;/em&gt;, the data showed a more stable picture across the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nuanced issue though: as the fungi spread to areas that were previously too cold, they're also likely to be driven out of regions that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exceptional-ongoing-global-heat-streak-defies-climate-predictions"&gt;get too hot&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the number of people exposed to these types of fungus will decline by 2100, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's the spread to new areas – and potentially vulnerable people, especially those with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-common-fungus-grows-a-poisonous-sword-to-free-itself-from-immune-cells"&gt;weakened immune systems&lt;/a&gt; – that the researchers are worried about. There's the possibility we'll also see more infections in healthy individuals as these species adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just human infections we need to worry about, the team says. Fungal outbreaks can decimate crops, adding to the growing challenges of feeding the world's population under climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The potential for increased human exposure in Asia and Europe, combined with contraction in parts of Africa and South America, could alter public health burdens and crop biosecurity landscapes over time," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6545782/v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers note, the fungus &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_auris"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been of concern to scientists. Capable of causing significant health problems, it too has been spreading further &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2022.100250"&gt;as the world warms up&lt;/a&gt;, and other species are likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is the flip side of these fungi: the benefits they bring to ecosystems, including carbon and nutrient recycling. This all needs considering when weighing up the shifts being caused by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Raising awareness and developing effective interventions for fungal pathogens will be essential to mitigate the consequences of this," &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/climate-change-putting-millions-more-people-at-risk-from-infection-causing-fungi/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; van Rhijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available at the preprint platform &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6545782/v1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research Square&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your cup of coffee has health benefits, but it also interacts with some medications. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee may affect how a medication is absorbed, metabolized or removed from the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An expert shares the seven drugs, like asthma and cold medications, that interact with coffee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the majority of people, coffee is part of their daily routine. It provides the energy boost you need to kick-start your day (hello, caffeine!), and boasts &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potential health benefits&lt;/a&gt; as well. The only drawback to your morning cup of joe is that it may not mix well with certain medications, especially if you take them earlier in the day.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many different ways coffee may interact with some medications. “Coffee can alter how certain medications are absorbed, metabolized or eliminated by the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjenbourgeois/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jennifer Bourgeois, Pharm.D&lt;/a&gt;. “It can speed up gastric emptying, causing the medication to move through your system before it’s fully absorbed. It also competes with medications that rely on liver enzymes like CYP1A2, potentially increasing or decreasing drug levels in the bloodstream.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t worry, this doesn’t mean you have to give up coffee completely, but you may need to adjust the timing of taking your medications and sipping on your coffee. Read on to find out which medications an expert warns may interact with your morning cup of joe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-antidepressants"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Antidepressants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your doctor has &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902827/foods-to-eat-for-better-mental-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prescribed an antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll want to make sure you aren’t drinking coffee too soon after taking one of these medications because it can make them not work as well as they’re supposed to. For example, the caffeine in coffee can form a complex with the antidepressant drug escitalopram (Lexapro), making it harder for your body to absorb the medication. Since less of the drug is absorbed, it may be less effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other antidepressants like clomipramine and imipramine are broken down by the same enzyme (called CYP1A2) as caffeine. So if you’re taking these medications with coffee, they may not be metabolized as quickly, which can lead to higher levels of the drug in your blood for a longer period.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, this interaction could increase the effects of caffeine, leaving you feeling jittery and restless. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-thyroid-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Thyroid Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck) doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Without adequate hormone levels, you may start to experience excessive tiredness, joint and muscle pain, depression or weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bourgeois explains that the absorption of levothyroxine, used to treat hypothyroidism, can be significantly reduced by coffee. In fact, some studies found that it reduces your absorption of the medication by as much as 50%. “This may lead to inconsistent thyroid levels and persistent symptoms like fatigue or brain fog,” says Bourgeois. “That’s why patients are advised to wait 30 to 60 minutes before drinking coffee after taking thyroid medications.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-osteoporosis-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Osteoporosis Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications used to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;treat osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, like risedronate and alendronate, shouldn’t be taken with coffee. “Whether it’s caffeinated, decaf or even just milk or juice, these can all reduce absorption due to how the medication binds and dissolves. The safest practice is always to take this medication with plain water only,” says Bourgeois.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-cold--allergy-medications"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Cold &amp;amp; Allergy Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is a nasal decongestant that can be purchased over the counter to help treat a stuffy nose from the common cold or allergies. Like caffeine, pseudoephedrine is also a stimulant. So when taken together with coffee, it may compound the side effects, making you feel more jittery and restless.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Those with diabetes should be extra cautious when consuming caffeine on this medication—some studies found that combining the two can raise blood sugar and increase body temperature.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-antipsychotic-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Antipsychotic Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who take antipsychotic medications like phenothiazine, clozapine, haloperidol or olanzapine may need to adjust the timing of their morning coffee. Coffee can interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize these medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, clozapine competes with coffee to be broken down by liver enzymes. If the medication can’t be metabolized, it becomes less efficient. A study found that the plasma concentration of clozapine was increased by 97% after taking it with 2 to 3 cups of coffee (about 400 milligrams of caffeine).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have asthma, a condition that can make your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826579/healthy-lungs-food/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;airways inflamed and irritated&lt;/a&gt;, your health care provider may prescribe a bronchodilator like aminophylline or theophylline. These medications relax the muscles in your airways, making it easier to breathe. Common side effects of this medication include nausea, headache, restlessness and irritability. Consuming too much caffeine (from coffee, tea or energy drinks) can increase the side effects you may experience while taking this medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood-thinning medications are often recommended for those who may be at risk for blood clots after surgery or have certain heart or blood conditions. Since &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blood-thinners-and-leafy-greens-8584000" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;these medications&lt;/a&gt; prevent blood from clotting, the most common side effect is the risk of bleeding. Taking these medications with coffee is risky since the caffeine in coffee can also slow blood clotting, which further increases your risk of bleeding or bruising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, research has found that coffee can lower the pH in your stomach, which can increase the absorption time of other blood thinners like aspirin. Since it’s absorbed faster, more is available to the body all at once, which can enhance the potential for bleeding.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us look forward to sipping on that first cup of coffee in the morning. While coffee is associated with plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-health-benefit-of-coffee-study-11726744" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth double-checking that it isn’t interfering with any of your medications. Reviewing this list is a good place to start. If you’re on one of these medications, you may need to adjust the timing of your coffee and medications. However, if you have specific questions about potential food or beverage interactions with your medications, be sure to check in with your health care provider.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers identified the EspW mutation by comparing the genetic sequences of 729 isolates of the new &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strain—dubbed REPEXH01—to genetic sequences of 2,027 other &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 isolates. Of the 729 REPEXH01 strains, all but two had a single nucleotide deletion in EspW (the remaining two had ambiguous sequences), while the deletion was present in less than 4 percent of the non-REPEXH01 &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains. The finding suggests the tiny change could be a genetic signature of the strain, and its persistence in a key disease protein may offer the strain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's unclear what that advantage might be. The deletion of a single DNA base (an adenine) shifts the frame of the three-sequence protein code for the rest of EspW. This could result in a shorter protein. It could also cause the molecular machinery that translates the genetic code to slip, leading to proteins of various lengths. In any case, the deletion is likely to result in a less fully functional EspW protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers suggest this could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;when it's on lettuce and other produce. For example, EspW might spur an immune response from an infected plant that causes stomata—pores on the surfaces of leaves—to close, blocking the bacteria's ability to invade. Thus, cutting back EspW may help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;sneak in—an adaptation in the ongoing arms race between the bacteria and its host. Another possibility is that EspW could function like HopW1, leading to more severe infection in plant tissues, which could lower the chances that those infected leaves are harvested and make it to grocery stores and atop burgers. Thus, cutting back on EspW could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; move to its human victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, additional research will be needed to understand what's going on. As the CDC researchers conclude: "the role of the single base pair mutation in this strain’s colonization and survival on leafy vegetables could yield valuable insights."&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a class="read-more-main-single read-more-main" href="https://collive.com/measles-case-confirmed-in-williamsburg/"&gt;Full Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="post_text"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A confirmed case of measles has been reported in the Williamsburg neighborhood, raising serious concern among local health professionals about the potential for a broader outbreak, particularly within the frum community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to severe health complications, especially in young children. With dense populations and close-knit social networks, the risk of rapid spread in the community is significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants their child to get measles,” warned local Crown Heights physician Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Eli Rosen&lt;/strong&gt; of the Crown Heights ODA, in a message to patients. Dr. Rosen stressed that if your child is unvaccinated or missing a booster, to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is proven to be both safe and effective. Two doses—typically administered at ages 1 and 4—offer up to 97% protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This development comes as health officials continue to emphasize the importance of proactive prevention measures to avoid a repeat of past outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feeling persistently exhausted or being in a constant state of low energy may be due to a mini-stroke you had without realizing, a study suggests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, some have reported continued challenges including reduced quality of life, thinking problems, depression, anxiety and fatigue.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study followed 354 people with an average age of 70 who had a mini-stroke for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were asked to complete questionnaires about their level of fatigue in the first two weeks after a mini-stroke and again at three, six and 12 months later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers looked at how many participants experienced fatigue by defining it as a score of 12 or higher. Those being analyzed also underwent had brain scans to check for blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts discovered that 61 percent of those surveyed experienced increases in their fatigue scores two weeks after the mini-stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half reported fatigue at the three, six and 12 month mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists also found that participants who reported feeling fatigued were twice as likely to have a history of anxiety and/or depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said that the study was observational and cannot prove that the mini-strokes were behind the persistent fatigue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Modrau said: 'Long-term fatigue was common in our group of study participants, and we found if people experience fatigue within two weeks after leaving the hospital, it is likely they will continue to have fatigue for up to a year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised that experts need to focus on whether mini-stroke patients are showing signs of fatigue and provide adequate care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For future studies, people diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack should be followed in the weeks and months that follow to be assessed for lingering fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could help us better understand who might struggle with fatigue long-term and require further care,' he concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has been published today in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not as extensively as a complete stroke, a mini stroke can cause a certain degree of brain damage when it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This damage can leave a person with muscle weakness, difficulty with coordination and a general sense of weariness - which are all signs of fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatigue is medically described as the persistent and excessive feeling of tiredness or lack of energy which interferes with daily activities, even after adequate rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Particularly, physical fatigue can include muscle weakness, aches, pain, gastrointestinal issues and headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While mental fatigue entails difficulty concentrating, learning new tasks, slowed reflexes and impaired decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain damage due to a mini-stroke can also change sleeping patterns, emotional distress and memory, all of which can contribute to ongoing tiredness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That estimate accounts for gases released when companies drill for oil and gas, transport it to refineries, turn it into plastic and mold it into products.

So now, in a new study, scientists are exploring the effects of a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Fusarium foetens &lt;/em&gt;and their therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unique effects of &lt;em&gt;F. foetens&lt;/em&gt; are truly miraculous," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://physiology.bjmu.edu.cn/HomePage/Staffs/Professors/b34569e2892b4cc98dfc4f3ca25c4e7a.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://physiology.bjmu.edu.cn/HomePage/Staffs/Professors/b34569e2892b4cc98dfc4f3ca25c4e7a.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Changtao Jiang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor and deputy dean in the School of Basic Medical Sciences at Peking University in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

However, little was known about the specific microorganisms and molecules involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, although gut bacteria have been studied more deeply, little is known about gut fungi. That's partly because gut fungi have diverse and complex nutritional needs, making them hard to grow in the lab, and samples are easily contaminated because the fungal spores are airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gut fungi are often termed the 'dark matter' of the intestinal microecosystem," Jiang told Live Science by email. But in their latest work, the researchers not only identified how &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;affects MASH&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but also pinpointed the molecules and metabolites involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the fungus, the researchers collected fecal samples from 100 people across five regions of China. They used a special system to grow the fungi within each sample in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system aims to mimic a real gut "as much as possible," Jiang said. It involves immersing small chips in fecal extract. Each chip contains chambers filled with a Jell-O-like substance infused with extracts from the fecal samples. Each chamber is capped with a membrane designed to allow nutrients from poo into the diffusion chamber without letting microbes escape through the same pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system was a "clever cultivation" technique for isolating different species of fungus, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lewis-kim/" target="_blank" data-url="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lewis-kim/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kim Lewis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology at Northeastern University who specializes in microbiome therapeutics and was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to analyzing samples from China, the team studied published data from other studies of intestinal fungi that used volunteers in eight other countries. This enabled them to identify the most common fungal strains found in the gut, not only in China but worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering data from around the world helped ensure the samples covered a broad range of diets and environmental exposures, as both factors shape the gut microbiome. "Urban residents typically exhibit lower gut microbiota diversity compared to rural residents," Jiang noted, "likely due to reduced contact with natural environments and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/colon-cancer-antibiotic-use-link.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/colon-cancer-antibiotic-use-link.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased antibiotic use&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fungi spread through the air, the researchers compared fungal communities grown from air and from intestinal samples to spot those likely to be contaminants. The team also tested how well the fungal strains withstood the temperature of the gut — around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) — and the lack of oxygen found in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through these experiments, the researchers found that across all of the fecal samples,&lt;em&gt; F. foetens&lt;/em&gt; stood out as the most common strain that was likely to thrive in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/astronauts-to-grow-livers-in-space-where-microgravity-might-help-them-thrive" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/astronauts-to-grow-livers-in-space-where-microgravity-might-help-them-thrive"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronauts to grow livers in space, where microgravity might help them thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;could influence fatty liver disease, the researchers administered the fungus to mice for two weeks. The rodents had been fed a high-fat diet designed to trigger MASH symptoms. Although the weight of the treated mice was comparable to that of the mice not given the fungus, the weight of their livers was less. The treated mice also had less liver inflammation and fibrosis and lower levels of chemicals associated with MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, Jiang and his colleagues found that the &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;treatment reduced the activity of a key enzyme for making certain types of fats. As the activity of this enzyme — called ceramide synthase (CerS) — fell, so did the levels of those fats. The researchers confirmed these effects through additional experiments on mice that had been genetically altered to either decrease or increase their CerS production, as well as on mice fed ceramide supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work "holds significant implications for developing clinical therapeutic strategies targeting gut fungi," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis agreed, adding that the "unexpected discovery" raises the idea that scientists could isolate gut microbes that "we never knew existed to fight human diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers plan to study the effects of &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;in humans. They also want to investigate the molecular pathways involved in the therapeutic effect and the roles other intestinal fungi might play in metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf-e657M9H54oC2oHcgQGaChFhgTiR7lMb4" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf-e657M9H54oC2oHcgQGaChFhgTiR7lMb4 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study, presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt;, found that even for those taking newer, higher-dose weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, people put weight back on once they stopped treatment. While those taking semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) lost double the amount of weight compared with people using older jabs – 16kg on average – patients put on 9.6kg within a year, meaning they could expect to regain all 16kg again in just over 20 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers studied 6,370 adults in eight randomised controlled trials and three observational studies. Of these, 1,465 patients were taking semaglutide and tirzepatide – higher-dose jabs recommended specifically for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36239137/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; of trials into the efficacy of different diets, not including drugs, by the same researchers, found that while people also regained weight after stopping diets, the rate of regain was much slower, taking at least five years to get back to the weight they were before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,” said Susan Jebb, the co-author of the study and professor of diet and population health at University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings raise issues for the NHS, as &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta875/resources/semaglutide-for-managing-overweight-and-obesity-pdf-82613674831813" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nice guidelines&lt;/a&gt; state people should not be on weight loss injections for more than two years. Additionally, many patients give up the treatment, whether because they are buying it privately so cannot afford it, because the side-effects do not suit them or because they are not losing weight any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Is it going to be worth the NHS investing in these drugs if they only have them for a short time and then they pile all the weight back on, or does the NHS have to accept that these are going to be long-term therapies?” Jebb added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Either people really have to accept this as a treatment for life,, or we in science need to think really, really hard, how to support people when they stop the drug​.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the study did not show causality, Jebb speculated that the difference in how fast people put weight back on could be due to the fact that diets are hard and people have to practise restraint to lose weight, whereas if you are taking a drug that knocks your hunger out completely, you don’t have to​ make that effort. “So when the drugs are then taken away, you haven’t got those sort of behavioural strategies in place that help keep the weight off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum, said: “It shouldn’t surprise anyone if people regain weight having used GLP-1 drugs without seriously attempting to improve their lifestyle … Using GLP-1 is not the quick fix which many users believe it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at Surrey University, said there was no point “just throwing people back out into the world of their own lives, carrying on their own behaviours from before” after coming off the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re going to need psychological counselling, behaviour change, nutritional support from that moment on to help them sustain healthier behaviour in the long term, to keep the weight off,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The NHS should introduce a stepped care approach through online support available to large numbers of people at low cost, online or in-person group support or more intensive 1:1 support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jason Halford, at the European Association for the Study of Obesity, said: “We need to ensure patients have the support to make the changes in their behaviour they need to sustain the benefits of treatment. [Weight loss jabs] are an adjunct to behavioural change, not a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxQSWhaczNKTG80T05tWDIxbG54YzZ6dWFnMFZidHVTX0JMbU95SktkY0R6OVI0QTd6dk1UN09mQjFkTjYtbmVzZy1LZlBLSFYtQ3F1aEF5UFBNdlNleVlPcjB1ZUh3UWpwdlpoVjQ5VW44eFkwUkFCa3ZNYjhlazBuX0pGUEUzNmZaNGRNdGZVMlYzdXNadGtWZFBBRkdueHhpYWhQdHUyMXVZdl9XT2lVcEJkRlRsdDZDS1JpS1I1VGxkYjZoTUJaZWR3ZExwRms</guid></item><item><title>5种天然降低坏胆固醇（ LDL ）水平的素食-印度时报 | 5 vegetarian foods that lower bad cholesterol (LDL) levels naturally - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxNZE1ackUxTXM0el82NWVPUnNfQndpczJXQ19FdTFveUlrNHMyWUhaYUg0S282cXRYczU3QTJPTDJBSTFHdEsxbkpqY3l4V0dLcVJ6d0hJclMwS1pMemJsTENzSnp6cktkTVBoQzZpd1JzQ3otb1REbVdjclNkYjdsWjZNUVhNN19NbmNvR2E4TDZhUFVUb0VTMTdlVnBCd0RvZXpkWlotZV9TZzU4WEtoX2dOQVhTSmJ5YXI5Ni12amloYXp5RDVyb1p0VmpfcXI0SzBERUhPZENoNVlOSnowVDhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rise in bad cholesterol (LDL) in the arteries leads to plaque formation, reduced blood flow, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. And as per experts, while it might be genetic, our daily lifestyle and eating habits also play a role in it. Hence, it is very important to pay attention to what we eat on a daily basis. Vegetarian foods—especially those rich in soluble fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants—can naturally help lower LDL. Foods like oats, legumes, nuts, seeds, berries, avocados, and vegetables bind cholesterol in the digestive system, prevent its absorption, and support its removal from the body. As per the &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2023/08/07/14/28/vegetarian-or-vegan-diets?"&gt;American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, a study has reported that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can lead to an average decrease of 0.34 mmol/L in total cholesterol and 0.3 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol compared to omnivorous diets.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 12-year study of nearly 500,000 UK adults found that loneliness increases the risk of hearing loss by 24%.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss—affecting the inner ear and auditory nerves—was most strongly linked to loneliness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Women and those experiencing economic hardship appeared most at risk, highlighting loneliness as a key public health target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIANJIN, China —&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness doesn’t just hurt your heart – it could also damage your ears too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half a million UK adults tracked for over a decade revealed a surprising truth: feeling lonely increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hearing-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; by 24%, according to a massive new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/hds.0281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Most striking? This link remained strong even after researchers accounted for a long list of potential explanations, including age, income, depression, chronic diseases, and even genes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study flips the usual narrative on its head. While it’s well known that hearing loss can lead to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt;, this research suggests the opposite can also be true. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-science-behind-the-loneliness-hearing-link"&gt;The Science Behind the Loneliness-Hearing Link&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Tianjin University, Shenyang Medical College, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong studied data from 490,865 adults in the UK Biobank cohort. At the start of the study, participants answered a simple question: “Do you &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/feeling-lonely-loneliness-cold-symptoms/"&gt;often feel lonely&lt;/a&gt;?” Nearly one-fifth (18.5%) said yes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 years, 11,596 people received a new diagnosis of hearing loss, with sensorineural hearing loss—the kind affecting the inner ear and auditory nerves—being most common.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers dug deep into the data, adjusting for age, sex, physical health, lifestyle behaviors like smoking and drinking, depression, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/isolation/"&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt;, socioeconomic status, and even genetic predisposition to hearing loss. And still, loneliness emerged as a statistically significant and independent risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-would-loneliness-hurt-your-ears"&gt;Why Would Loneliness Hurt Your Ears?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team believes multiple pathways could be at play. Loneliness has been shown in previous studies to trigger physiological stress responses—including increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and elevated activity in the body’s stress systems—all of which can damage delicate structures in the ear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lonely individuals also tend to engage in riskier behaviors, like smoking or physical inactivity, but these didn’t fully explain the hearing loss connection in this study. Instead, economic hardship appeared to play a bigger role — accounting for about 16.7% of the link between loneliness and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Accumulated evidence suggests that loneliness can lead to socioeconomic adversity, which in turn contributes to adverse health outcomes,” the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were especially pronounced in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/loneliness-social-isolation-heart-attack-stroke-older-women-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;. Lonely women had a 30% higher risk of developing hearing loss, compared to an 18% increased risk in lonely men. The authors suggest that women may be more biologically sensitive to the health impacts of loneliness, based on prior studies showing stronger cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in lonely women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-global-health-issue"&gt;A Global Health Issue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is already a massive public health concern. More than 1.5 billion people worldwide live with it, and it’s linked to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, depression, and physical impairment. Tackling modifiable risk factors—like loneliness—could help millions of people preserve their hearing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this study especially important is that it followed people over time and found that loneliness preceded hearing loss—not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s not just that people with hearing loss become lonely. People who are lonely &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/loneliness-epidemic-myth/"&gt;to begin with&lt;/a&gt; may be damaging their hearing over time. “Social enhancement strategies aimed at alleviating loneliness may prove beneficial in hearing loss prevention,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been feeling &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/loneliness/"&gt;persistently lonely&lt;/a&gt;, it might be time to not only reach out for emotional support—but to consider it an investment in your long-term physical health, including your hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed data from the UK Biobank, which enrolled over half a million community-dwelling adults across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Researchers assessed loneliness with a single question (“Do you often feel lonely?”) and tracked participants for an average of 12.3 years through electronic health records. Incident hearing loss was identified through hospital diagnoses using ICD-10 codes. The team used Cox proportional hazard regression models to examine the association between loneliness and risk of incident hearing loss, controlling for numerous potential confounding factors including age, sex, socioeconomic status, lifestyle behaviors, chronic diseases, social isolation, depression, and genetic risk for hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among 490,865 participants (54.4% female, average age 56.5 years), 18.5% reported feeling lonely at baseline. During follow-up, 11,596 participants (2.4%) developed hearing loss. After adjusting for all confounders, lonely individuals had a 24% increased risk of hearing loss compared to non-lonely participants (hazard ratio: 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 1.31). The association was stronger for sensorineural hearing loss specifically, and more pronounced in women than men. Socioeconomic factors accounted for 16.7% of the association, while physical health, mental health, and other factors explained smaller portions of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on a single binary question to assess loneliness, which may not capture variations in frequency or intensity of loneliness. Additionally, hearing loss was identified through hospital records, which might miss milder cases not requiring medical attention. Since most UK Biobank participants were of European descent, findings may not generalize to other ethnic groups. As an observational study, it cannot establish causality definitively, though the researchers controlled for numerous confounding factors and conducted multiple sensitivity analyses that confirmed the robustness of their findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by several grants, including the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology, the LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program, the 345 Talent Project of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, and the Scientific Research Project of the Liaoning Province Education Department. The authors declared no competing interests.&lt;/p&gt;

One day later, these memories exhibited a stronger emotional tone than the original recollections. The study was published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01200-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is a powerful tool for emotional expression, allowing individuals to convey feelings that may be difficult to articulate through words. It is used therapeutically in hospitals and mental health clinics to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. In educational settings, music can aid memory retention and learning, especially when used to teach language, mathematics, or historical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socially, music fosters a sense of community, bringing people together through shared cultural experiences such as concerts, religious ceremonies, and national anthems. Athletes and exercisers often use music to enhance performance and maintain motivation, as certain tempos can regulate heart rate and energy levels. In marketing, music is strategically employed to evoke specific emotions, influencing consumer behavior and brand perception. Music is also integral to rituals and traditions, marking significant life events such as weddings, funerals, and holidays, thereby reinforcing cultural identity and continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yiren Ren and her colleagues sought to explore whether music played during memory recall could introduce false emotional elements into previously neutral memories. In other words, they wanted to examine whether listening to music while recalling memories could alter the emotional tone of those memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 44 healthy young adults recruited from the Georgia Tech School of Psychology subject pool. The average age was approximately 20 years, and the sample included 20 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed an experimental task in which they memorized and recalled several short fictional stories written to resemble autobiographical episodic memories. Episodic memories refer to personal recollections of specific events, including contextual details like time, place, and emotion. The stories were written to be as emotionally neutral as possible so that any emotional changes during recall could be attributed to the experimental manipulation. In total, 15 neutral stories were used in the main task. An additional five stories were written to be emotionally positive or negative and were included to disguise the study’s primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment was conducted over three consecutive days. On Day 1, participants read and listened to recordings of the 20 stories (15 neutral, 5 emotional). Each story was presented twice. Participants then typed out the stories as they imagined them, using as much detail as possible. They also completed standardized assessments of mental imagery ability (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Day 2, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while completing a word selection task designed to prompt recall of the previously studied stories. Each trial displayed 10 words on the screen. Four were key words taken directly from one of the original stories, and six were emotionally valenced lure words—three positive and three negative—that were semantically related to the story but did not appear in the original version. Participants were asked to recall the story associated with the keywords and to select the words that best fit their recollection. Each story was randomly assigned to one of three within-subject conditions: background music with positive emotional valence, background music with negative emotional valence, or silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Day 3, participants completed two memory tests focused on the neutral stories. In one test, participants were presented with words and asked whether each one had appeared in the original story. The word list included both the original keywords and the emotional lures from Day 2. The goal was to assess whether music-induced emotional context during Day 2 recollection would bias participants to falsely remember emotional lures as part of the original story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants exposed to music during Day 2 recollection were more likely to incorporate emotionally congruent lures into their memories. On Day 3, when recalling the stories, they were more likely to report emotional content that matched the valence of the music they had heard during Day 2. In other words, positive music increased the likelihood of recalling stories with added positive elements, and negative music increased the likelihood of negative elaborations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these behavioral findings, the fMRI results revealed that recalling stories with music led to altered patterns of brain activity compared to recalling stories in silence. Specifically, music was associated with increased activity and functional connectivity in regions including the amygdala, frontal cortex, and visual areas. These brain regions are known to be involved in emotion processing, memory, and imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggest that these effects manifest through reconsolidation mechanisms and neurally may be intimately linked to amygdala and medial temporal lobe function, as well as diffuse differences in engagement of networks associated with imagery, perspective taking, attention, and control,” the study authors concluded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects of music on memories. However, study authors report that participants were generally highly accurate in their recognitions of words. This may have produced a ceiling effect, limiting the magnitude of the observed effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-024-01200-0"&gt;Affective music during episodic memory recollection modulates subsequent false emotional memory traces: an fMRI study,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Yiren Ren, Sophia Kaltsouni Mehdizadeh, Grace Leslie, and Thackery Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 18:15:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWGtBNERxbzk2bUlwR2lwR0NNOUVvWEVzc0UyX3NjWmhFS2JfSG9YOGtrSDZHY3c4eVhyM0NOeDU3VEMwN0xnWHo4SkRZR0lmTzlrdWZyRm5Ba2xDdTFoTE1QekhZOWhtMnpoU1hXWnp6UW5qdGFUT09YUFo2b1VBZ1JRMEJWVnJZeVlKZDZBcjA</guid></item><item><title>宠物猫的禽流感正在上升。业主需要了解的信息-全球新闻 | Bird flu in pet cats is on the rise.

					&lt;p&gt;As a deadly &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/bird-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; outbreak sweeps through wild and domestic bird populations globally, researchers have identified an alarming trend that could bring the virus closer to humans: a significant increase in infections among pet &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt; and other feline species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While avian influenza — commonly known as bird flu — has long been a concern for poultry and wild bird populations, infections in mammals, especially pets like cats, have historically been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that appears to be changing fast, new research warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review, published May 7 in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf261/8123920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, found a surge in bird flu virus infections among cats worldwide — both indoor and outdoor — particularly linked to the emergent &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10614208/bird-flu-strains-world-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H5N1 strain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend, experts warn, could signal an increased risk of the virus jumping from animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;The review, conducted by researchers at the University of Maryland, analyzed 20 years of scientific data on bird flu in felines, from 2004 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It documented more than 600 cases across 18 countries, with more than 300 fatalities. Researchers found a sharp rise in domestic cat infections over the last few years, specifically in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more cats that get infected with H5N1, the more it creates a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of the virus to and from humans, the review warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed,” the researchers stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_10934726_68256e27c4c16" data-displayinline-video-id="10934726" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/10934726/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_10934726_68256e27c4c16" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Many of the infected cats were exposed through contaminated food or raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in November 2024, &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10955478/pet-cats-die-drinking-raw-milk-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two pet cats in California died&lt;/a&gt; after drinking raw milk that had been contaminated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;div class="c-tabs"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Canada has not officially reported any bird flu infections in cats, that doesn’t mean they haven’t occurred, said Shayan Sharif, a professor and associate dean with the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been at least one confirmed fatal case of &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9602040/avian-flu-dog-death-canada-oshawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;avian influenza in a dog in Oshawa, Ont.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada has also documented bird flu infections in other domestic animals and wild mammals, fuelling concerns about the virus’s ability to spread across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“H5N1 is already known to infect cats, domestic cats, and also other feline species like tigers, mountain cats … either kept in captivity or the wild,” Sharif said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t actually know was how susceptible cats can be to H5N1, specifically this particular new clade (2.3.4.4b). It’s become quite apparent that domestic cats are, in fact, susceptible to H5N1.”&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

				How are cats getting bird flu?			&lt;/h2&gt;
						&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;	
	&lt;p&gt;Given how closely cats live with humans, the researchers wanted to find out how widespread bird flu infections might be in feline populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review showed that nearly two-thirds of all known feline infections were in domestic cats, and of those, 71 per cent didn’t survive. The main culprit is the newer H5N1 strain (clade 2.3.4.4b), which first showed up in cats in 2022 and has spread rapidly since.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;

					
		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;It also pinpointed several ways cats are getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most caught the virus by eating infected birds or raw meat. But some cats get sick after drinking raw milk from infected dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the reported infections in felines in the review were confirmed or suspected to be a result of eating dead pigeons, chickens and other birds, as well as contaminated raw chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just outdoor cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b recently reported by the Colorado Health Department included two indoor-only domestic cats with no known exposure to infected animals,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This observation raises concerns regarding new and unknown transmission routes of (avian influenza) to domestic cats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="section-heading"&gt;	&lt;p class="l-article__sectionHeading c-sectionHeading "&gt;

				What is the risk to humans?			&lt;/h2&gt;
						&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although very rare, cat-to-human transmission of the virus has been reported, the review stated.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p id="gpt-ad-300250-14" class="c-ad__unit" data-ad-pos="14" loading="lazy"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2016, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/spotlights/avian-influenza-cats.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an outbreak of avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; happened among cats in New York City animal shelters and more than 100 cats were infected. A veterinarian who had close, prolonged, unprotected exposure to the respiratory secretions of infected cats contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharif said the risk of transmission from cats to humans remains very low, but added it’s still important to stay vigilant during this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In case of avian influence, unfortunately, it can be quite lethal in cats,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are neurologic signs, such as tremors and seizures. There have also been indications that they can go blind, unfortunately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your cat is showing symptoms, he recommends contacting your local vet immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the researchers of the review are calling on wider surveillance among domestic canines to determine how widespread the virus is, “in order to appropriately assess the risk of spillover to humans and other animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_11072328_68256e27cb515" data-displayinline-video-id="11072328" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/11072328/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_11072328_68256e27cb515" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have known that the virus behind "mono" &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dramatically raises the risk of multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MS), a disease in which the immune system attacks nerve cells. But while most people are exposed to the mono virus by adulthood, only a few develop MS, raising the question of why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have uncovered a possible reason why most people infected with the mono virus never develop MS: a specific immune-system gene may mediate their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mono virus — called Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) — infects &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13974-mononucleosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13974-mononucleosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 90%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of people by adulthood, although it usually causes no symptoms. In some people, it can trigger infectious mononucleosis, better known as mono, causing fever, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite EBV's widespread presence, very few people exposed to the virus go on to develop MS, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34785-multiple-sclerosis-inhibits-central-nervous-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34785-multiple-sclerosis-inhibits-central-nervous-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic condition that affects the brain and spinal cord&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

A 2023 study published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)01232-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867423012321%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)01232-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867423012321%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that many people with MS have previously been infected with variants of EBV that boost production of the protein that this gene encodes. This molecule can help harmful, self-destructive cells evade detection and destruction by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, the researchers examined data from more than 487,000 people from the UK Biobank, a biomedical database and research resource that includes data from 500,000 U.K. adults. They examined whether individuals carried the HLA-E*01:01 gene variant and reviewed their medical histories to see if they had ever been diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also accounted for other known MS risk factors, like smoking, childhood obesity and other genetic markers. The findings showed that people with the HLA-E*01:01 variant who had previously had mono were much more likely to develop MS than those who carried the variant but never had mono, or those with a different version of the same gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the combination of the genetic variant and mono appeared to work together to raise the risk of developing MS. This may be because this specific version of the HLA-E gene may raise the risk of MS by weakening the immune system’s ability to control EBV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who carried two copies of the variant — one from each parent — and had a history of mono, these factors accounted for 65% of their risk of MS, lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/andrea-nova" target="_blank" data-url="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/andrea-nova" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andrea Nova&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pavia, told Nature Reviews Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding further supports the idea that genetic susceptibility is necessary for IM [infectious mononucleosis] to act as a risk factor for MS, and vice versa," Nova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could play an important role in improving early detection and treatment of MS. In theory, by screening for the HLA-E*01:01 genetic variant, doctors may be able to identify people at higher risk of developing the disease down the line, especially if they’ve had mono. This could enable earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment, which is key to slowing long-term damage. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489082/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489082/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Early intervention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can significantly improve a person’s overall health and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-oQKmZ6tW3AtgQxmwmeSD6i-vm1qa7YRy9e0i8pHfiwj7scgGtFgm77I" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-oQKmZ6tW3AtgQxmwmeSD6i-vm1qa7YRy9e0i8pHfiwj7scgGtFgm77I slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to early data from &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06344026"&gt;the Phase 1/2a ASPIRO (NCT06344026) study&lt;/a&gt;, an open-label clinical trial testing the safety and tolerability of ANPD001 over one year when injected at either of two doses in adults with moderate to advanced Parkinson’s. Researchers are also tracking changes in on time, or periods when motor symptoms are adequately controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this first-of-its-kind study, we are seeing clinician-reported and patient-reported improvements as well as a strong safety and tolerability profile at six months,” Edward Wirth III, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at developer &lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/"&gt;Aspen Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aspen-neuroscience-announces-6-month-aspiro-phase-12a-clinical-trial-results-of-personalized-cell-therapy-for-parkinsons-disease-302448009.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were presented in a poster at the 30th World Congress on Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders, held May 7–10 in New York. An abstract for the poster, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prd-journal.com/article/S1353-8020(25)00371-2/fulltext"&gt;Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intracranial delivery of autologous iPSC-derived dopaminergic precursors in moderate to advanced Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Parkinsonism &amp;amp; Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; result from the loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in motor control, and low levels of dopamine lead to slowed or stiff movements, tremors, and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Replacing lost neurons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/technology/pipeline/"&gt;ANPD001&lt;/a&gt; is designed to replace the dopaminergic neurons that are gradually lost in Parkinson’s. As an autologous therapy, it uses a patient’s own cells, eliminating the need for immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection by the immune system. The process begins by collecting skin cells from the patient, which are then reprogrammed in the lab into induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stem cells are guided to develop into precursors of dopaminergic neurons and returned to the patient by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/precision-mri-system-part-parkinsons-stem-cell-therapy-trial/"&gt;MRI-guided injection&lt;/a&gt; into a brain region called the putamen, where they’re expected to develop into functional dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRO study involves patients ages 50–70 who respond to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/#Levodopa"&gt;levodopa&lt;/a&gt;, a mainstay Parkinson’s treatment that provides the body with a molecule it can use to produce dopamine, but still have uncontrolled motor symptoms. Its main goal is to test ANPD001’s safety over one year, with patients continuing to be monitored for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the study’s &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/1st-patient-treated-trial-parkinsons-cell-therapy-anpd001/"&gt;launch last year&lt;/a&gt;, ANPD001 has been found safe and well tolerated, with no serious side effects. All patients in the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/cell-therapy-anpd001-safe-first-2-parkinsons-patients-groups-trial/"&gt;first two groups&lt;/a&gt; who received the investigational cell therapy were sent home within 48 hours as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently presented data showed that the three patients who received a low dose of ANPD001 — 5 million precursors of dopaminergic neurons each, delivered in a surgical procedure under general anesthesia — experienced no bleeding or graft-induced dyskinesia (uncontrolled movements caused by the cell therapy). The most common side effects were pain at the surgical site and tongue swelling from lying face down during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At six months, patients experienced a 45% improvement in MDS Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III scores, a measure of motor symptom severity, when they were off medication. They also reported a 71% improvement in MDS UPDRS Part II scores, which measures their ability to perform everyday activities such as eating, dressing, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, patients had two fewer hours each day of off time, periods when motor symptoms aren’t adequately controlled despite treatment with levodopa, and 1.5 more hours each day of good on time, when motor symptoms are adequately controlled without troublesome side effects, such as involuntary movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANPD001 has received &lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-anpd001-autologous-investigational-cell-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;fast track designation&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which may help accelerate its development and regulatory review. Benefits of this status include frequent guidance, expedited approval processes, and eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a common cause of hospital infections, causing &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25164-pseudomonas-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterium is also pretty tough. Some types are resistant to nearly all antibiotics (known as multidrug-resistant, or MDR &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), hence it is often dubbed a "&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-is-a-superbug-77773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;superbug&lt;/a&gt;". In the US, this strain is known to cause thousands of deaths in hospitalized patients each year, as well as tens of thousands of non-lethal infections. Those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to such infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a troublesome organism, but now researchers have found that it is capable of breaking down plastics commonly used in hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the United Kingdom, this research identified an enzyme, named Pap1, that was produced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; taken from a wound. This enzyme can break down biodegradable plastic called polycaprolactone (PCL), which is used in various medical packages and devices, such as sutures, catheters, ventilators, implants, and plastic packaging for medical tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, multiple bacteria have been found to produce enzymes that degrade plastic, but they have all been isolated from the environment. This is the first time one has been identified in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an important development, as it could explain why these bacteria are so persistent in hospitals. If they’re able to degrade plastic, then they may be able to contaminate surfaces and tools that are otherwise thought to be sterile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to identify this enzyme, the researchers took the gene that codes for the enzyme and transplanted it into &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;scherichia coli &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. When &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; expressed this enzyme, the team found that it started to break down the PCL on agar plates or beads. The same was true for the &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;isolated from the wound. Finally, the team produced a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;bacterium that had the gene encoding Pap1 removed from it; they found that this version was not capable of degrading plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This poses several clinical challenges with respect to infection. PCL is widely used in medical care and is one of the materials at the forefront of biotechnological innovation due to its favorable biocompatibility profile," the team explains in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a host perspective, the capacity for a pathogen to be able to compromise the structural integrity of any medical device or implant that contains PCL is likely to cause the failure of the medical intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this ability to degrade plastic helps the bacteria survive. If they can create small pits or impressions in the plastic, they have a chance to use them as niches that shield the bacteria from the immune system, disinfectants, or antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the enzyme increases the amount of biofilm the bacteria can produce when compared to a different surface, such as glass. Generally speaking, if bacteria produce higher amounts of biofilm, they are more likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antibiotic-resistance-how-were-trying-to-win-the-microscopic-arms-race-76106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;resistant to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Biofilms are the dominant mode of growth for bacteria, and adopting this mode of growth can make pathogens particularly recalcitrant to treatment," the team explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to test whether the ability of these bacteria to form biofilms would make them more virulent, the team also implanted them into greater wax moth (&lt;em&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/em&gt;) larvae.

The device is controlled through an app, which has an easy start-up guide and walkthrough that showed me how to lead my own VNS session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Truvaga recommended locating my pulse on the side of my neck—the vagus nerve runs right below that.

(&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMWn2y0X66s" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMWn2y0X66s" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Truvaga also says" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;Truvaga also says&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you may experience a side effect of “lip pull” muscle contraction—literally a downward pull on your lip—which is apparently normal and a sign that you’re in the correct position, but just the thought of it freaked me out.) However, with the option of choosing your level of stimulation (one to 10), I figured I could take things slow, and started at level one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I couldn’t really feel anything at first, but over the next few days, I increased it to level two and three, after which I felt a minor tingling sensation. Eventually, I increased it to level four, which was my sweet spot, since the stimulation felt comfortable there. (Truvaga says levels four to seven are the ideal range for most people.) The stimulation itself felt like a warm tingle, but it wasn’t uncomfortable or painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="composite" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="16" class="embed css-0 e17cny3g2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1yt7om e17cny3g0"&gt;&lt;div class="size-medium css-103j9yb e17cny3g1"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-1txdenb e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="vns truvaga device" title="vns truvaga device" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-48-pm-6824c20da5818.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-48-pm-6824c20da5818.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-48-pm-6824c20da5818.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-48-pm-6824c20da5818.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1xs3or1 e1geg53v2"&gt;Tianna Soto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="size-medium css-103j9yb e17cny3g1"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-1txdenb e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="vns truvaga device" title="vns truvaga device" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-57-pm-6824c22a26ef9.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-57-pm-6824c22a26ef9.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-57-pm-6824c22a26ef9.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-12-16-57-pm-6824c22a26ef9.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1xs3or1 e1geg53v2"&gt;Tianna Soto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the first two days of the experiment, I chose “sleep” as my intended goal.

While it’s hard to measure that benefit in the short-term, I’ll admit, I did feel pretty sharp during week two. I attended multiple meetings, interviews, writing deadlines, and workshops throughout the week—all while keeping up with my daily workouts—and I felt more energized, motivated, and excited to tackle the day. Of course, it’s hard to say whether this newfound focus was from VNS or me just having a good week—but I do think carving out a few minutes for myself every morning to use the device helped me prep for the week in a calmer, more grounded way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, this was a fun experiment and I was surprised at the positive changes I saw in my mind and body. I didn’t really expect to see any dramatic differences, and of course, it’s difficult to say whether these positive changes were due to the VNS device or the placebo effect. But after tracking my workouts, mood, and seeing my sleep stats, I’m pretty optimistic that the vagus nerve deserves more hype. &lt;strong data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-experts-think-about-vagus-nerve-stimulation-devices" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;What Experts Think About Vagus Nerve Stimulation Devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Are VNS devices legit? As for the FDA-approved ones—which are implanted in your chest by a surgeon—yes, says Dr. Hankenson. This type of treatment has been approved for treating seizures and refractory depression (also known as “treatment-resistant” depression—that’s when at least two antidepressants aren’t enough to manage the condition, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24991-treatment-resistant-depression" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24991-treatment-resistant-depression" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="30.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="30.1.0"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It may also be an emerging treatment for post-stroke patients who have experienced some loss of upper extremity function, Dr. Hankenson says.&lt;br data-node-id="30.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The tricky part is figuring out whether or not non-implantable devices have the same impact as implantable ones—which will require a lot more research, says Dr. Hankenson. “We have to wait and have these devices tested by a third party, or gather multiple studies to see if they all hold the same strength and value. That’s something we haven't yet seen for some of these non-invasive home devices,” Dr. Hankenson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Dasgupta agrees. “Early studies hint VNS could be helpful for things like &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/18582_vagus-nerve-stimulation-patients-alzheimers-disease.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/18582_vagus-nerve-stimulation-patients-alzheimers-disease.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7613925/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7613925/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Parkinson’s" data-node-id="33.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but most of that potential is still being explored in research, so it’s too soon to call it a sure thing,” he says. &lt;br data-node-id="33.5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Even if VNS does have real benefits, it’s not a cure for these conditions, he says, and it should be used alongside standard medical care. “These devices aren’t magic fixes, and we still need more independent research to fully understand their long-term effects,” Dr. Dasgupta says.&lt;br data-node-id="34.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So while VNS probably shouldn’t be your first line of defense for any serious mental or physical health issues, it might be worth considering if you’re otherwise healthy and cleared by your doctor to try a device.&lt;strong data-node-id="35.1"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="35.2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-an-at-home-vagal-nerve-stimulation-device" data-node-id="36" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;How To Use An At-Home Vagal Nerve Stimulation Device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There’s no perfectly-defined method here, and it hasn’t been well-documented how often, or how intensely, you should be stimulating your vagus nerve with at-home devices, says Dr. Hankenson. “If you're just starting out, it's appropriate to use once a day at the lower settings and see how you do,” she says. If you’re not seeing any adverse effects and you’re feeling good overall, you can increase it to two times a day. Then, try it consistently for two to three weeks. &lt;br data-node-id="37.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re experiencing mild symptoms (like low energy or bad sleep), it’s likely safe to keep using the device after those two to three weeks. Over time, you may find that you don’t need to use it as regularly, or you only use it when you notice symptoms returning, Dr. Hankenson says. But because there’s no gold standard for how long you should use an at-home device, it’s best to check with your healthcare provider and get their input on the ideal frequency and length of use for you, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are some potential risks to be aware of, though. Anyone who has heart irregularities, arrhythmias (abnormal rhythms), and/or a pacemaker should probably steer clear since VNS devices can interfere with your heart rate, says Dr. Hankenson. Anyone with blockages in the arteries should also exercise caution. “Anything that can disrupt plaque in that area could increase the risk of a stroke or a neurologic event,” she says.&lt;br data-node-id="40.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Even if you’re perfectly healthy, using a VNS may be off-putting and cause mild side effects—like muscle twitching, headache, and/or mild dizziness—but this usually only happens while you’re using the device and disappears shortly after the session, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576255&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truvaga.com%2Ffaq%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooOKZekI1fPFEnpCOH7B-8pT4XijNOKvry32q6BaDV-nVUPm2bM" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.truvaga.com/faq/?srsltid=AfmBOooOKZekI1fPFEnpCOH7B-8pT4XijNOKvry32q6BaDV-nVUPm2bM" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="per Truvaga" data-vars-ga-product-id="b32d6e96-4822-4427-9342-14957ae6195c" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="41.1" data-href="https://www.truvaga.com/faq/?srsltid=AfmBOooOKZekI1fPFEnpCOH7B-8pT4XijNOKvry32q6BaDV-nVUPm2bM" data-product-url="https://www.truvaga.com/faq/?srsltid=AfmBOooOKZekI1fPFEnpCOH7B-8pT4XijNOKvry32q6BaDV-nVUPm2bM" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576255&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truvaga.com%2Ffaq%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooOKZekI1fPFEnpCOH7B-8pT4XijNOKvry32q6BaDV-nVUPm2bM" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","metadata":null,"network":{"name":"Skimlinks"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/uYFb/truvaga-truvaga-s-frequently-asked-questions"}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="dce14c87-ea98-4688-a71a-4167a7dd00f6" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="41.1.0"&gt;per Truvaga&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “While side effects are usually mild, like tingling or lightheadedness, it’s still a medical device, so using it with care makes sense,” Dr. Dasgupta says.&lt;br data-node-id="41.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-should-try---an-at-home-vagal-nerve-stimulation-device" data-node-id="42" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;Who Should Try &lt;strong data-node-id="42.1"&gt;An At-Home Vagal Nerve Stimulation Device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There’s no black-and-white answer for who “qualifies” as a good candidate for an at-home VNS device, but it could be beneficial if you struggle with stress, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64743371/probiotics-anxiety-energy-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64743371/probiotics-anxiety-energy-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anxiety" data-node-id="43.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, digestive issues, and/or difficulty sleeping, says Dr. Hankenson. &lt;br data-node-id="43.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="44" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you have any of the above challenges, it’s always best to try to treat them without a VNS device first (especially given the high price tag of many at-home devices).

What began as a handful of cases in Texas in January has now has surpassed 800 across several states, with many more cases probably going unreported. It is the worst outbreak in 30 years and has already killed three people. Other smaller outbreaks bring the total number of cases recorded in 2025 so far to over 1,000. But above all, public-health experts worry that the situation now is a sign of worse to come.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tace001o3b76yshdr4kj@published"&gt;My boyfriend “Kevin” and I have been together for a year and a half, and he’s everything I could want in a life partner. His sister spilled the beans to me that he’s been looking at engagement rings, so I expect him to propose soon. However, there’s one thing that gives me reservations.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tadr001p3b76h0d9438c@published"&gt;When Kevin was in college, he … got around quite a bit. He had more than 300 encounters. The fact that he was with all these other women before he and I met doesn’t bother me. It’s the (what I think could be very real) possibility that we will get married only to have some woman show up demanding child support, or down the line, having to deal with a previously unknown son or daughter tracking him down. Given Kevin’s history, are my concerns valid, and should they give me pause when it comes to accepting a proposal from him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2taiy001s3b76ytsbl06p@published"&gt;Hypothetically, surprise children are always a risk with any man who hasn’t been celibate until marriage. The fact that Kevin engaged in hundreds of sexual encounters during college absolutely does heighten your awareness of that possibility. One really useful, yet missing, crucial piece of information would be whether he consistently used condoms (and other forms of birth control) during these encounters. Sure, they aren’t 100 percent effective, but they do drastically reduce pregnancy. It’s also worth taking into account whether he checked in with partners after any encounter where the condom may have broken or slipped. Basically, if he was having sex with half of his female classmates with no birth control in place, that’s one thing. But if he was taking precautions, it’s less likely that he has a child somewhere that he doesn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2takg001t3b76izepe4ry@published"&gt;That said, a decision to marry someone should take into account your feelings—all of them, including your worries. This concern &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; already giving you pause, and it’s worth doing some introspection around where that’s coming from. What’s behind your aversion to this possibility? Is whatever you find off-putting or worrisome about it also showing up in more subtle ways in your relationship? For instance, do you get the sense that Kevin was irresponsible during his college years, which is maybe reduced but still apparent now? Or do you have pretty rigid ideas about what structures families should have, and, if so, are you prepared for other unforeseen outcomes such as divorce, or untimely death? Are you strongly against having children in your life at all? And, in the event someone comes looking for Kevin later, would you be open to him having a relationship with them while you stay out of it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tam1001u3b76209obse8@published"&gt;I think it’s also really important to consider whether you can share this concern with him and discuss how you might navigate such a situation. If your immediate reaction is, “No, I can’t open up to him about this,” &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; the reason to reject the proposal. But if, when presented with an appropriate opening, the two of you can talk through your worries, you might find yourself more comfortable with proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2m3eg005ff0kxdn8o2q90@published"&gt;I am a recently divorced woman with two daughters. I have been working hard to have a fit body, so I was eager to try out my cute new bikini when I took my daughters to the pool. The problem (at least for some people) is that I am blessed with what is apparently called a “happy trail”: a thin line of dark hair going from my belly button to my bikini line. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/08/happy-trail-grooming-advice.html"&gt;In the past, I have shaved it, but this time I figured I should hold onto this minor vestige of bodily autonomy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But consuming extra amounts could make blood cancer more aggressive, the team of experts hailing from the University of Rochester warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks... our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the [risks and] benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,' the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also said while the research is still early, they are &lt;span&gt;'very excited' because targeting taurine production from leukemia cells 'may be a possible avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an experiment on mice and human leukemia cells, the researchers found stopping taurine from entering cells could slow the progression of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, comes as additional research works to understand &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13493163/red-bull-colon-cancer-crisis-young-people.html"&gt;if taurine could fuel other forms of cancer&lt;/a&gt; like colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York found taurine, an ingredient in energy drinks, could fuel the growth of leukemia cells (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is an non-essential amino acid found naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles. It's also found in meat and fish and is used in certain beverages to energize cells and boost mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to help regulate the amount of calcium in nerve cells and control inflammation, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study looked at mice with a SLC6A6 gene, which transports taurine from different areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also took samples of human leukemia cells and transplanted them into the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered taurine is produced by a subset of healthy cells in bone marrow, where leukemia grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The SLC6A6 gene then transports taurine from the bone marrow to leukemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe this is the first time taurine has been found in bone marrow, worsening leukemia - a blood cancer that strikes 67,000 Americans and 10,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 23,000 Americans and 5,000 Brits are expected to die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, as leukemia cells feed on taurine, they go through glycolysis, a process in which cells break down the sugar glucose to produce energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycolysis gives cancer cells the energy to divide and multiply, making leukemia more aggressive, causing more cancer cells to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jeevisha Bajaj, lead researcher from the Wilmot Cancer Institute at the University of Rochester, said in a press release that further studies should investigate levels of taurine in leukemia patients and look at how to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially crucial because taurine supplements are often recommended to cancer patients, as it may lower inflammation and reduce side effects from chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells,' Dr. Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is considered safe in small amounts, but higher levels have been shown to cause vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still unclear the exact role taurine plays in other forms of cancer, though researchers have suspected it could be linked to the alarming rise of colon cancer in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) shows rates of leukemia have remained steady, though deaths are decreasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a phase two trial, a team at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c02e1e20-30bf-11f0-b1d2-353395a3f03f"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting adults ages 18 to 40 who have not been diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the group is meant to consume at least one Red Bull or Celsius drink every day, and researchers will compare their gut bacteria to a control group who didn't consume the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal of the study, which is still recruiting participants, is to see if taurine fuels hydrogen sulfide (HS2) metabolizing bacteria, which are 'overrepresented' in colon cancer cases and have been shown to cause inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 16:19:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPR2lyR1dicWp3ZV9JSG55cnhSNE0wU2U5ZE1sUDNycS1DRXRzeFh0QUhuMFFrSlZCdW1BUDU0ZU1fSVc1RlNPUm5Yek9GajBfek5EOGJXd0lmNEw4UzhWZGVDTE1ZZUVya1g4WFZSRkpKdXpUS3ExQUFMMDdkSE9lekNzRDhTbTBQbzJmNHJBOS1zcUdoQmsyRUxISndoaEFBd1Y1eU9weV9WQ1lMQVZELQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养学家的说法，睡前不应该吃的食物- glamour.com | Foods You Should Never Eat Before Bed, According to a Nutritionist - glamour.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBpejhWc0VUd3lBMlE1eUpTeDRUMjZVeWlDZHN2azk0U3F6NkFRakZyOUlzVV9IYVRVNGd0LXRhaERBbGJfZU12T0NZZnFLUVF4X2Z2NzJCTG1KWGFjU0JTNmZGUEYzMXFSU1BkRWF0allNUko3aHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing quite as satisfying as an indulgent &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/the-healthiest-late-night-snac" target="_blank"&gt;midnight snack,&lt;/a&gt; is there? A little somethin’ somethin’ right before (and maybe even in) bed. Maybe you enjoy snacking on a few pieces of chocolate before you hit the hay. Or perhaps you creep to the fridge at 11 p.m., pull out that leftover takeout, and tuck in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, we have some disappointing news—apparently, eating right before bed can cause havoc on the digestive system as you nod off. “Of course there are career or relationship considerations that could get in the way here, but ideally you should aim to have two to four hours between finishing eating and going to bed,” says Kyle Crowley, nutritionist and chief product officer at supplement retailer &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.theproteinworks.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.theproteinworks.com/"}' href="https://www.theproteinworks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Protein Works&lt;/a&gt;. “This will give you the best chance at reducing physical discomfort from digesting the food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse? There are certain foods you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; eat before bed if you can help it. Read on for what the experts say about which foods are messing with your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spicy food before bed can sometimes lead to heartburn, which isn’t exactly a recipe for a restful night,” Crowley says. “Plus, chili peppers can raise your body temperature, something that might make it harder for your body to ease into deep sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016787609290048G" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that consuming &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/spicy-foods-chilli-peppers-live-longer" target="_blank"&gt;spicy food&lt;/a&gt; can disrupt sleep and lead to more time awake throughout the night. In fact, people who eat spicy food every day have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131218/" target="_blank"&gt;4.73 times greater odds of insomnia&lt;/a&gt; than those who never eat spicy food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramen is another spicy dish that it might be best avoid before bed—no matter how tempting that takeout box in the fridge may be. Not only is ramen often spicy, it’s also made with processed noodles that can be &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles"}' href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to digest&lt;/a&gt;, often taking &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/"}' href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;longer than two hours&lt;/a&gt; to work its way through your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oranges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acidic foods like citrus fruits can increase your chances of heartburn,” says Crowley. “It might help to enjoy these earlier in the day rather than as a late-night treat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fried chicken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there—it’s 2 a.m., you’ve had a little too much to drink, and the allure of some chicken nuggets call out to you. However, as delicious as it can be (especially late at night) fried foods probably aren’t the best food for your late-night meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research shows that fatty foods can reduce sleep quality and lead to more restless nights,” Crowley says. “So avoid heavy, greasy meals like fried chicken close to bedtime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheese&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you’ve got in the fridge is a tantalizing block of cheddar. However, it might lead to a weird night’s sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229376/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that dairy products can lead to lighter sleep. In fact, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2"}' href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many people find&lt;/a&gt; that consuming cheese right before bed can lead to vivid dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this probably comes as bad news to late-night snackers. But while it is better to avoid food altogether at night, there are some foods you should never eat before bed—and there are some foods that will probably sit a little better. Try reaching for a handful of nuts (which contain melatonin), a glass of milk (which may support better sleep), or some &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/the-sleepy-girl-mocktail" target="_blank"&gt;cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; (which helps regulate sleep hormones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was previously published in &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/foods-never-eat-before-bed" target="_blank"&gt;Glamour UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>glamour.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:53:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBpejhWc0VUd3lBMlE1eUpTeDRUMjZVeWlDZHN2azk0U3F6NkFRakZyOUlzVV9IYVRVNGd0LXRhaERBbGJfZU12T0NZZnFLUVF4X2Z2NzJCTG1KWGFjU0JTNmZGUEYzMXFSU1BkRWF0allNUko3aHc</guid></item><item><title>专家刚刚发现，阿尔茨海默氏症的症状可以在20多岁和30多岁时出现。以下是需要注意的事项-雅虎 | Experts Just Discovered That Alzheimer's Symptoms Can Surface In Your 20s And 30s.

Ultimately, 1,112 study participants who did in-home interviews were given cognitive tasks like immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span. They also provided a sample for genetic testing. The researchers then tied those scores to Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) scores in 529 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers discovered that certain risk factors and biomarkers linked to Alzheimer’s disease may influence a person’s cognitive function starting in their mid-20s and continuing onwards. “Key risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease are linked to cognitive function as early as ages 24–44, highlighting the need for early prevention in the US,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of biomarkers did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study focused on a few different factors, including the CAIDE score. The list included things like a person’s age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading), body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4), a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers also discovered that ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers linked to Alzheimer’s disease may be present and related to cognition in people in their 40s and younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a test to see if I’m at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sort of. “When I see younger patients concerned with getting dementia when they are elderly, I ‘risk stratify’ and do the same tests I would do in an octogenerian concerned they have dementia,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Clifford Segil&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That means doing blood tests to look for reversible causes of memory loss—including thyroid tests and checking vitamin levels like B12. “I would also obtain a structural picture of their brain to see if they have had silent strokes or atrophy,” Dr. Segil says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The only actual available "test" for Alzheimer’s disease in younger people would be to check someone's APOE 4 levels, which is considered the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strongest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;strongest&lt;/a&gt; genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Segil says. “But this [test] being positive in a young patient would be challenging to say has any clinical significance,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to protect my brain health before 30?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few things you can do right now to make sure you have the healthiest brain as you get holder. Aside from eating a healthy diet, staying active, avoiding tobacco, and limiting your alcohol consumption, it’s a good idea to “vigorously” use your brain, says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Amit Sachdev&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is best achieved through self-investment in education but also through socialization and human interaction,” he says. “Working on finding and cultivating new friends and interests in youth helps to develop those old friendships that are so important later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Segil also recommends keeping your body and mind busy to maintain your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, if you’re concerned about your dementia risk or if you have a family history of the disease, check in with your primary care physician, who should be able to offer some personalized guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQZUp0QWI1aThuQzhWUlJVR08zX2FGZElVY1ZOY3B0bGJ5OW5YSFlsVFl5VFF4cFRmUi1oS2swcmp0QnhqSk9wRUszVXMxYnJvcEtWdEtxak1xQWV0V2ZITGlLNW5BMlBpQjdTenhkdlIydTh4NFZIUUVNa1VaN3BEWEZ5QVpEdlpXSVZHcjBlNVZzWGRX</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，阿尔茨海默氏症的症状可能比想象的要早几十年出现。以下是须知事项- womenshealthmag.com | Alzheimer's Symptoms Can Appear Decades Earlier Than Thought, New Study Finds.

The researchers then tied those scores to Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) scores in 529 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers discovered that certain risk factors and biomarkers linked to Alzheimer’s disease may influence a person’s cognitive function starting in their mid-20s and continuing onwards. “Key risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease are linked to cognitive function as early as ages 24–44, highlighting the need for early prevention in the US,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-11" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More On Alzheimer's And Dementia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-biomarkers-did-the-study-find" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;What kinds of biomarkers did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The study focused on a few different factors, including the CAIDE score. The list included things like a person’s age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading), body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4), a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers also discovered that ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers linked to Alzheimer’s disease may be present and related to cognition in people in their 40s and younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-there-a-test-to-see-if-im-at-risk" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Is there a test to see if I’m at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sort of. “When I see younger patients concerned with getting dementia when they are elderly, I ‘risk stratify’ and do the same tests I would do in an octogenerian concerned they have dementia,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil," data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil&lt;strong data-node-id="16.1.1"&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That means doing blood tests to look for reversible causes of memory loss—including thyroid tests and checking vitamin levels like B12. “I would also obtain a structural picture of their brain to see if they have had silent strokes or atrophy,” Dr. Segil says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The only actual available "test" for Alzheimer’s disease in younger people would be to check someone's APOE 4 levels, which is considered the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5839141/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="strongest" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;strongest&lt;/a&gt; genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Segil says. “But this [test] being positive in a young patient would be challenging to say has any clinical significance,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-protect-my-brain-health-before-30" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;What can I do to protect my brain health before 30?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few things you can do right now to make sure you have the healthiest brain as you get holder. Aside from eating a healthy diet, staying active, avoiding tobacco, and limiting your alcohol consumption, it’s a good idea to “vigorously” use your brain, says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amit Sachdev," data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Amit Sachdev&lt;strong data-node-id="21.1.1"&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“This is best achieved through self-investment in education but also through socialization and human interaction,” he says. “Working on finding and cultivating new friends and interests in youth helps to develop those old friendships that are so important later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Segil also recommends keeping your body and mind busy to maintain your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, if you’re concerned about your dementia risk or if you have a family history of the disease, check in with your primary care physician, who should be able to offer some personalized guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

However, as a humble nutrient, fiber is often overlooked. But what if this is the missing ingredient to weight loss success? Can fiber supplements replace whole foods? In this podcast, a nutritionist answers readers’ questions about fiber and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the internet is awash with articles, charts, and recipes centered around eating more protein — anything from a 30-gram-protein breakfast to high-protein drinks and more — to naturally lose weight. And although the key to achieving good weight loss results is indeed a higher protein intake, there is a nutrient that is often overlooked: fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, statistics show that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007499?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;less than 5%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans realistically meet their recommended daily fiber intake, which is on average up to &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;34 grams (g)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for adult men and about 28 g for adult women. So, how can we eat more fiber?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/in-conversation-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;In Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we’ll be tackling burning questions such as: What is fiber, and why is it important for our bodies? How can we tell whether we are eating enough fiber? Is it right to call fiber nature’s Ozempic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll differentiate between soluble and insoluble fiber while discussing the ideal daily intake for different people. We’ll also touch on how fiber supplements like psyllium husk compare with whole foods, weighing their benefits for our well-being. We will also look at how fiber plays a crucial role in fighting insulin resistance and its potential role in supporting weight management goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To discuss this and more, we’re joined by registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/authors/lisa-valente" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Lisa Valente&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD. Lisa holds a Master of Science in nutrition communications from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, and she completed her dietetic internship at Massachusetts General Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the podcast recording, for the readers of &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, we also asked Lisa what her top favorite high fiber foods were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will say frozen berries, fresh too, but frozen berries tend to be a little bit higher in fiber for a fruit. And when you buy them frozen, they’re just more affordable and easier to have on hand. [T]hey don’t go bad on you in a day — so, you can add those to smoothies or mix them into oatmeal or yogurt,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa said her second choice would be whole wheat pasta and shared a fun fact about fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brown rice only has one gram more of fiber than white rice, but whole wheat pasta has significantly more than white pasta. [It creates] like this nice fiber-rich carbohydrate base to your dinner to add some vegetables or protein to,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her third choice was chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I sprinkle them on oatmeal, but you can also make chia seed pudding where you soak them with some milk or non-dairy milk and add a little bit of fruit. They’re very filling and they not only have fiber, but they also have omega-3 and a little bit of protein. So I feel like they’re sort of this tiny but mighty little seed where you can check off a lot of nutrition boxes at once. So if I had to pick three, that’s a good starting place for me,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please listen to our podcast episode in full below or on your preferred streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our podcast has also been shortlisted in two categories — Best Health, Wellbeing &amp;amp; Food Podcast and the Best Science &amp;amp; Medical Podcast — at this year’s &lt;a href="https://publisherpodcasts.com/2025/en/page/shortlist2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Publisher Podcast Summit and Awards&lt;/a&gt;.
