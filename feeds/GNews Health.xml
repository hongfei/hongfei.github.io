Our team found COVID-19 booster shots available at many locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, multiple pharmacy employees said the vaccines could only be administered with a prescription to people who are either 65 or older or have underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those rules could change after the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy (ACIP) meets later this month to discuss recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has been reevaluating decades of U.S. vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP recommendations on COVID-19 boosters could impact the price and availability of the vaccine in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could be a lot easier, or a lot more difficult, to get this vaccine than it is today," said Will Humble, executive director of the AZ Public Health Association, "and it could also change whether your health insurance plan is going to pay for it or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several governors are not waiting for the CDC committee to act. They are making their own state recommendations to ensure the immunizations will be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, was still weighing her options this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm certainly concerned about new guidance coming out around protections for COVID," Hobbs told reporters on Wednesday. "We're going to look at the options we have to keep Arizonans safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can reach ABC15 Senior Investigator Melissa Blasius by email at &lt;u&gt;melissa.blasius@abc15.com&lt;/u&gt; or call 602-803-2506.

      &lt;p&gt;Pneumonia struck first. Then tonsillitis spiraled into sepsis. Malaria battered him next, and after treatment, the other illnesses flared back up again. This unvaccinated 2-year-old boy is trapped in a relentless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very sad. I knew these things could be prevented by vaccines," his mother Alzhraa Fadul says through an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I feel guilty that I can't do anything to help my son," the 26-year-old adds. "I'm worried about my son every day. I should've gotten vaccines for my son."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there was nowhere for Fadul to get them. Her family lives in an abandoned classroom with 10 strangers in Kosti, Sudan, where vaccination campaigns were once &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/ar/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-launches-yellow-fever-vaccination-campaign-among-ethiopian-refugees-and-host-communities.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hailed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a "remarkable achievement" and &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-kicks-off-november-subnational-polio-immunization-campaign-to-vaccinate-45-million-children.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the country a coveted polio-free status one decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That all changed in April 2023 when civil war &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/27/1172123699/sudan-conflict-explained" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;broke out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sudan rapidly rose to the top of the list of countries with the highest proportions of unvaccinated newborns — claiming an unwanted leading position last year, with more than half of its babies missing all immunizations. Fadul's son is &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the 14 million kids&lt;/a&gt; worldwide who don't receive any vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're really in the eye of the storm here," &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/sudan/unicef-representative-sudan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sheldon Yett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says. Yett, who is UNICEF's representative in the country, adds that &lt;a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/no-end-sight-sudans-two-years-war" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 70%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the country's health facilities in conflict-affected areas are in "ruins." "Children who would have otherwise been able to brave the many things that Sudan throws at children are far more vulnerable. Life is pretty grim."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea and Yemen join Sudan among the hardest-hit countries with immunization programs in dire straits. Two of those countries — Sudan and Yemen — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/11/26/247297862/violence-increases-in-central-african-republic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2024/whats-happening-in-the-central-african-republic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;active&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2023/06/21/1183192685/yemeni-civil-war-frontline-photos" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;war zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In all, &lt;a href="https://prezly.msf.org.uk/a-shot-at-life-how-to-reach-more-children-in-humanitarian-settings-with-lifesaving-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 55%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated kids live in conflict-affected areas. "Being a child growing up in those contexts, you've got the odds stacked up against you," says &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/events/detail/2025/06/03/south-east-asia-events/webinar-on-immunization-and-vaccine-research-area-prioritization-for-the-who-south-east-asia-region" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Naor Bar-Zeev&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vaccine experts note that vaccine hesitancy &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/1/6" target="_blank"&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt; in these regions, they say that's not the main reason that children &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09169-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;miss vaccinations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In most cases, it's either lack of awareness among caregivers or lack of access to health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It wasn't my choice not to vaccinate my child. It was war that prevented me," Fadul explains. "I would sell everything I have to get a vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The leading causes of infection among unvaccinated kids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The things we actually worry about are the horses rather than the zebras," &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/staff/conway-james/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. James Conway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says. Conway, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, uses this metaphor to explain that while rare complications — zebras — can occur, it's important for physicians to first focus on preventing the most common causes of serious illness — the horses. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," Conway adds, noting this cliché is truer than ever in countries like Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210065" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Two of those&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "horses" are pneumococcal disease and rotavirus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal disease often causes pneumonia, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204247" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide for all children under 5, with an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;annual toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of about 700,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rotavirus is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciad060" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most common culprit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for diarrhea in that same under age 5 group in lower resource countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Conway says both are especially dangerous for kids living in crowded environments because those infections are more likely to spread and become dangerous once a child is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Overcrowding enhances the transmission of respiratory infections like pneumococcal pneumonia because tight living conditions increase the frequency of person-to-person interactions. Densely populated areas often also have limited access to clean water and sanitation, which facilitates the spread of diarrheal diseases through contaminated water, food and surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's sort of like a bucket of gasoline just waiting for somebody to throw a match in," Conway explains. "All it takes is the introduction of one of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccines have been available for decades to prevent both pneumococcal disease and rotavirus. In many parts of the Global South, vaccination campaigns target both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in low-resource settings, "access to even basic medical care can be really compromised" because of conflict and other factors, Conway notes. And that would have an impact on vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other factors that worsen outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The millions of children who don't get vaccines may face other formidable challenges if they fall ill. Malnutrition &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-062122-014910" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the production of cells used by the immune system to fight off infections, increasing the risk of disease. Various micronutrient deficiencies can also worsen outcomes. For instance, vitamin A deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of severe complications and death from measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As that battle rages, malnourished kids don't develop an appropriate immune response," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once infected, the body demands even more energy to fend off infection, leading to a vicious cycle. "These infections can progress rather quickly, especially in small babies," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonia kills nearly three-quarters of a million kids a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cough and difficulty breathing are usually the &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.9039" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first signs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once the microbe hijacks the body, it damages the lung tissue, making breathing more difficult. It's almost like trying to breathe through a sponge soaked with water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the lungs lose their ability to exchange gases, organs receive less oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Eventually, you succumb to the inability to breathe properly and oxygenate your blood," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the infection &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccc.2017.08.005" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;overwhelms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the body, severe drops in blood pressure further starve vital organs of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2308.151550" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that some children die of pneumonia in as few as two days. "These things can progress rather, rather quickly," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The danger doesn't end with pneumonia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Looming over unvaccinated children is yet another deadly threat: diarrhea. It comes from many sources, but many kids get immunized against rotavirus — the leading cause of diarrhea in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In high-income countries, diarrhea is fairly common but rarely life-threatening because of widespread access to clean water and sanitation, rehydration therapy and adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The data look starker for children in the Global South. That's because patients with diarrhea are treated with oral rehydration. Conway says, "Oral rehydration is something that we take for granted, but it's really not readily available in a lot of these settings."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As with other infections, malnutrition worsens outcomes for kids with diarrhea. A large study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001256" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that children with malnutrition and diarrhea were four times more likely to die compared with those with diarrhea and sufficient nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30230-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unreliable access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to life-saving treatment and poor rotavirus vaccine coverage create a deadly combination. Diarrhea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30114-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;accounts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for about one in 10 deaths among children under 5 in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ongoing diarrhea and vomiting can rapidly lead to dehydration. "We've all been dehydrated out hiking or doing something on a hot day, and you get a headache. Gradually, that transitions to being just more and more lethargic, where these kids just don't have the energy to move and do anything," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If dehydration isn't treated, circulating blood volume and blood pressure plummet. As in pneumonia, the blood pressure drop deprives vital organs of oxygen. The body's balance of salts, acids and blood sugar is also disrupted, causing damage to organs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once multiple organs cease to function, death is imminent. Depending on the child's health before the illness, death can occur "within a few days" or take a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While the body will do everything possible to maintain blood flow and perfusion of the brain, that's the last thing that starts to suffer," Conway says. "This lethargy then goes into being unresponsive and can progress gradually to coma and then death."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingering long-term side effects even after survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When resources like antibiotics and oral rehydration are available, some children will recover from vaccine-preventable diseases. But that doesn't mean a child will survive unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As these viruses run throughout the body, any organ can suffer," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles, mumps and other vaccine-preventable diseases can cause debilitating and permanent damage. Conway says it's not the organism itself causing the damage, but rather the immune response to the microbe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is one of the most devastating consequences of measles and mumps, causing deafness in &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 to 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of cases. The complication is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200233" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rarer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with mumps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are quite a few nerves in the body that are quite fine fibers and very susceptible to damage," Conway explains. "Oftentimes, the most vulnerable nerves are the ones that take a hit, and the nerves that impact hearing are really, really vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other complications &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; infertility and blindness. Conway added that intellectual disability is another risk because these infections attack the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nerves are one of the parts of the body that don't recover quickly," Conway says. "You can rebuild lung tissue over time if you survive one of these infections, but nerve tissue just doesn't regrow and replace itself, so many kids do end up with neurologic deficits."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some kids get vaccine-preventable diseases even before they're born&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Newborns can also suffer if their mother isn't immunized against diseases like measles, mumps and rubella. Ideally, pregnant people should receive all recommended vaccines — but there may not be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.039" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for adult immunization. "This idea of immunizing adolescents and adults is just not as common in the Global South," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if the pregnant person does not have immunity to a virus like &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2019/01/prepregnancy-counseling.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they're at risk of getting infected. That can lead to miscarriage, fetal death or stillbirth&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another harmful pathogen is rubella — an infection that has some symptoms in common with measles but is generally less severe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the fetus survives an early rubella infection, some babies are born with a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome, which can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12264" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deafness, cataracts, congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The birthing process also poses dangers. Pregnant people &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2017/09/update-on-immunization-and-pregnancy-tetanus-diphtheria-and-pertussis-vaccination.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;should receive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a dose of the tetanus vaccine during each pregnancy. But if the person giving birth doesn't have immunity to tetanus, non-sterile delivery practices can result in neonatal tetanus. From 2000 to 2020, cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7111a2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decreased&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 88% worldwide, with 2,229 being reported in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Neonatal tetanus is heartbreaking," Conway notes. "These babies are incapable of doing anything on their own. They're incapable of breathing on their own because all the muscles in their body are contracted."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emotional toll of missing vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A shadow of guilt follows Fadul, the mother from Sudan. Despite the ongoing war making vaccines scarce, she blames herself for not being able to protect her son.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was sad because I knew we would never get a vaccine," she recounts. "There was no light at the end of the tunnel."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the stress &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228435" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experienced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by parents comes from seeing the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases in their communities, and sometimes in their own children, as with Fadul.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There is this sense of complacency in the U.S.," Conway says. "Once the system is sort of humming along and working well, a lot of these diseases do fade into the background. When you go into lower-resourced areas, there's still familiarity with these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is still an appreciation of vaccines. People not only welcome them, but they demand that their kids get immunized," Conway explains. "Parents, especially mothers, are very wired toward being protective. There's a natural, expected stress that happens when you can't provide whatever it is that your kid needs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Conway thinks that sense of maternal stress is valid. The first 1,000 days of a child's life — a term &lt;a href="https://thousanddays.org/about/our-story/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;popularized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the early 2010s to describe the importance of the first two years of life — are some of the most vulnerable periods for growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first 1,000 days are really, in many ways, going to determine sort of who and what you are," Conway says. "That's part of the reason that I think the support of aid agencies is so critical in these disrupted situations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cuts in U.S. funds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for programs like Gavi, the Vaccine alliance, paint an unclear picture of how Sudan and other countries will handle the many obstacles being thrown their way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fadul's son is now weakened by infection and hunger, though still alive, but she fears he can slip over the edge at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents in America have never seen what I have. I've seen kids die in front of me," Fadul says tearfully. "I don't want another child right now. This would mean two unvaccinated kids. I want to have another child when I know they'll be safe. But life is not stopping in Sudan. Every hour, women are still giving birth. These children will face the same problem my son faced. I hope that one day these children will no longer suffer."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

About 2,500 students attend the school in grades nine through 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials in Wake County, the county in which the school is located, said the person, who was not publicly identified, was present at the school sometime last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Division of Public Health said it is working with Wake County Schools to identify and notify anyone who may have had close contact with the person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-ec98b1f0-8cb3-11f0-91c6-31447f8d929e" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers tuberculosis to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14540025/Woman-contracts-deadliest-virus-wrong-vaccine.html"&gt;deadliest disease in the world&lt;/a&gt; because it kills the most people of any disease, claiming about 1.25million lives every year, mostly in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Announcement of the North Carolina comes just a few days after &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-ec99ea70-8cb3-11f0-91c6-31447f8d929e"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; officials reported three people in the state tested positive for TB. There was no connection between the patients, suggesting each was infected by a different source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were located in the Greater Portland area, officials said, and work is now underway to identify and isolate their close contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There has been a recent uptick in TB cases in the US, with America reporting 10,347 infections in 2024, the most recent year available, up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011 when there were 10,471 cases recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An active case of tuberculosis was reported in someone at Leesville High School in Raleigh, North Carolina (pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The names and ages of the patients have not been revealed. The above shows a chest X-ray of a person with tuberculosis (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say the risk to the public is low, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's CBS17 reported that parents of students in the high school received a notice from the Wake County Health Department’s Communicable Disease division informing them of 'a situation affecting our school.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice did not reveal the 'situation' was a case of TB, but said anyone exposed would be contacted by county officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB was confirmed on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A county spokesperson said in an email to CBS 17: 'We have been notified that an individual with active tuberculosis was present at Leesville [Road] High School last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are working with Wake County Public School System to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with this person. Those individuals will be contacted directly with instructions for tuberculosis testing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, there were 215 TB cases in the state in 2023, the latest confirmed data available. This was an increase from 164 cases in 2022 and the highest in nearly a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preliminary CDC data recorded 250 TB cases in North Carolina last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far in 2025, there have been 128 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB has a high fatality rate, killing up to half of patients if left untreated or unvaccinated. That's far above the fatality rate for Covid, below one percent, measles, 10 percent for untreated patients, and Legionnaire's disease, also around 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis was effectively a death sentence in the 18th and 19th centuries when there was no cure, although it can now be prevented by vaccines and treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis killed more than 16,000 people in the US every year in the 1950s, but deaths have now dropped 28-fold to around 550 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tuberculosis infections are on the rise in the US, and nationwide have now reached their highest tally since 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most tuberculosis cases in the US are imported or due to migration into the country, the CDC says, with most patients coming from outside America's borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further details on the North Carolina and Maine cases, including names, ages and exact locations were not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, warned that tuberculosis could only be passed on if someone was in 'close, prolonged contact' with an infectious person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Portland Press Herald: 'The vast majority of people do not need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not spread through casual contact like shaking hands or sharing a towel. It's much less contagious than influenza or Covid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can take days for the disease to infect a healthy person who lives in the same home as a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine has already reported 28 cases of tuberculosis so far this year, figures show, just 11 cases below the 39 recorded in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older adults and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms of the disease include a persistent and unexplained cough and sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties, extensive lung damage and the infection may spread to other organs like the liver or back, causing pain in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients die from the disease due to respiratory failure, or when damage to the lungs means they can no longer get enough oxygen into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors can treat the disease with antibiotics and can vaccinate against the disease using a shot called the BCG vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not routinely offered in the US, because the disease is not common, but can be requested for children, and leaves a small circular scar on the arm, a normal response and sign that the vaccine was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also be given to adults, but it is less effective in this group and may lead to someone falsely testing positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In developing countries, the vaccine is administered to children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She has struggled with frequent illness ever since first contracting Covid in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Ever since then, I just catch everything,” she said. Though she expressed her frustrations with a weakened immune system, she had her doubts that she would qualify for vaccine coverage under the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her immediate worry is simple: not being bedridden on the day she says “I do”. “Weddings are expensive, and I don’t want to be sick that day if I can prevent it, and so I just want to get the vaccine,” she said. “I’ve gotten my booster every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the new rules have complicated what was once routine. Instead of stopping by CVS, as she has in past years, Heckle found herself on the phone with her insurer, navigating coverage questions and learning she’d need to go to a different pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I just am really hoping that I don’t have to risk being sick on my wedding day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Though she was relieved to find out her vaccine would still be covered in some capacity, she’s still worried that her wedding – attended by people of all age groups – will likely host a significant number of guests who won’t be vaccinated. She doesn’t want anyone to get sick because they were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know how many of the people who will be at my wedding are trying to get vaccinated, or how many qualify,” she said. “It just feels like it’s so much more complicated than it’s ever been before to get a vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For 18-year-old student Zeke Fraser-Plant, the new guidelines heightened concerns he already carries daily. His parents and a close friend continue to live with long-term effects from contracting Covid: “My father has a lot of problems with brain fog. My mother loses her sense of smell completely. It comes back off and on.” His friend, who caught Covid as a teenager, struggles with memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fraser-Plant’s his biggest fear has just been made stronger. “I’m absolutely terrified that I might kill somebody I know by bringing it home to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unlike Heckle, Fraser-Plant does not automatically qualify for coverage. He and his family are prepared to pay out of pocket, even considering travel abroad. “It’s also a possibility that we might go out of the country to get the vaccine, if that becomes necessary,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But cost is only part of the concern. As he prepares to enter community college after a year of service with the Washington Conservation Corps, he worries about being surrounded by classmates who are now less likely to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With community college, I mean, it’s a total crapshoot,” he said. “I don’t think most people are going to take it well, if you just walk up and ask them about their vaccination status or how seriously they take Covid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His unease is understandable: his grandmother recently survived cancer, leaving her immune system fragile. He takes every precaution he can – masking, boosters, vigilance – but fears that there’s only so much he can do with an increasingly unvaccinated public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With the way vaccination rates are going, it’s just terrifying,” he said. “I just don’t know why more people don’t take these kinds of things seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Haley, a 40-year-old hairstylist from Portland, Oregon, is anxious about her job as someone who interacts with several people each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am a person in a public job that would prefer to be vaccinated to protect myself and others, and I don’t know if I’ll qualify now,” she said, adding that she feels that the current administration’s views on vaccines are “very, very dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Roger, an emergency room physician from Alaska, said that healthcare decisions “should be based on scientific evidence, and not based on pseudoscientific ideology”. He says that he still witnesses many people die or become permanently disabled from Covid, and he’s afraid that those numbers are about to soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I fear that as an emergency physician, I will see more unfortunate children and adults becoming ill and dying due to the lies propagated by this administration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Elena, who is retired and living in Los Angeles, currently has stage 4 cancer and is on chemotherapy. Though she still qualifies for the vaccine, her 59-year-old husband apparently will not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Would my vaccination protect me if the person I live with gets sick? Possibly not,” she said. “And my chemo is incompatible with the only available treatment for Covid. It seems obvious that household members of immune-suppressed patients should also be eligible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Tammy Hansen, a 61-year-old librarian from Illinois, shares similar concerns of infecting a vulnerable loved one with the virus. She is about to become the caretaker for her 85-year-old mother following a major cancer surgery and ongoing chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I want the vaccine so I can double protect her from getting Covid,” Hansen said. “My husband is 79 and I also worry about transmitting Covid to him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “I swear if I get Covid and give it to my mom and she dies, I’ll be taking some kind of action.

Still, it has sidelined many who came down with COVID-19 and has some health officials concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five things to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-we-are-not-out-of-the-woods-yet" class="subhead"&gt;1) We are not out of the woods yet.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data released Friday, there are now 14 states with “very high” levels of coronavirus detected in their wastewater — California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Connecticut, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID-19 lab tests are confirming infection also continues to rise statewide and in the Los Angeles area. For the week that ended Aug. 30, California’s COVID test positivity rate was 12.83%, up from 7.05% for the week that ended Aug. 2. In L.A. County, the positive test rate was 14.83%, up from 9.33%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in the sewage of Northern California’s most populous county, Santa Clara, were still considered “high” as of Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-but-there-may-be-signs-were-reaching-the-peak" class="subhead"&gt;2) But there may be signs we’re reaching the peak.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, the COVID-19 positive test rate was 13.1%. That’s below the prior week’s rate of 18% but still higher than the rate for the week that ended Aug. 2, which was 10.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, the test positivity rate was 8.1% for the week that ended Aug. 30. That’s down from the prior week’s figure of 8.7% but higher than the 5.8% reported for the week that ended Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, wastewater data in L.A. County show that coronavirus levels declined slightly from the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-overall-the-summer-spike-has-been-generally-mild" class="subhead"&gt;3) Overall, the summer spike has been generally mild.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a new variant, there hasn’t been much severe disease from COVID-19 this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID hospital admissions in California have been increasing — with the latest rate of 3.93 admissions per 100,000 residents for the week ending Aug. 30, up from 2.38, from the week ending Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they remain relatively low statewide and in L.A. County. The number of L.A. County residents seeking care for COVID-related illness, or who have been hospitalized, “is quite a bit lower than during summer surges in 2023 and 2024,” the county’s Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this summer hasn’t seen COVID activity to the extent of a year ago, when the state experienced its worst summer wave since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-but-the-fall-and-winter-are-an-open-question" class="subhead"&gt;4) But the fall and winter are an open question.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mild summer wave could create conditions for problems later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/covid-rising-in-california-how-bad-will-this-summer-be"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the state Department of Public Health said that scientists anticipated California would see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-there-is-still-massive-confusion-over-the-future-of-covid-vaccines" class="subhead"&gt;5) There is still massive confusion over the future of COVID vaccines.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vaccine skeptic — federal agencies have in effect made it more difficult to get vaccinated against COVID-19 this year. The Food and Drug Administration has “approved” COVID-19 vaccines only for those 65 and older, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means, across the country, people younger than 65 interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine must now either consult with a healthcare provider or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;health condition&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a potential hurdle that can make getting the vaccine more difficult and, some health experts worry, prompt even more Americans to eschew getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Hawaii joined California, Washington and Oregon in launching the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/04/hawaii-to-join-west-coast-health-alliance-with-california-oregon-and-washington/" target="_blank"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;: an interstate compact meant to provide science-based immunization guidance as an alternative to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear, however, whether the formation of the West Coast Health Alliance would make it easier for people to get COVID-19 vaccines at the nation’s largest pharmacy retailers, where many people get their shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical groups, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, are offering their own recommendations to advise individuals and families on what vaccines they should get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQMjVJaTVDek9JUDVXN2Y5LXY5dzFhQXFoemN1OUFrT0RydW91OE4zVDhEcnJrNVJXQkx2LXhldVpDY0hvemYzX18zWGdXLUw3LWxfd2pveFpOTldSZzMtRWNFS0lPRUZ0dHBGZUpMU21YcTVHYjY1X2NZNzVpd2VjZnRXZnVITGpxQlFfZWtZQ09aakVqREtNY2RXbUFfcmV3dFVyb2lINVllYjd2NW5SM0dtb2VFbWdr</guid></item><item><title>“真正的逆转” ：科学家发现导致大脑衰老的蛋白质，并学习如何阻止它- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/truly-a-reversal-scientists-find-protein-that-causes-brain-aging-and-learn-how-to-stop-it-80715</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;A protein that’s central to brain aging has been discovered by scientists, who’ve gone the extra mile by also finding out how it can be stopped. FTL1, as it’s called, is a key mediator of aging in the hippocampus – a part of the brain that’s particularly badly affected as the years roll by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as people have tried – and boy, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/that-millionaire-who-is-trying-to-de-age-himself-is-now-starting-penis-rejuvenation-therapy-70538" target="_blank"&gt;have they tried&lt;/a&gt; – there is as yet no way to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/putin-and-xi-want-to-achieve-immortality-with-organ-transplants-could-they-80670" target="_blank"&gt;halt&lt;/a&gt; the inexorable march of time and its effects on the human body. In order to tackle aging, scientists first have to understand exactly how it works – what proteins and genes are involved, and how they impact different organs and systems in the body. This new study helps answer some of those long-standing questions as they apply to the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/artificial-sweeteners-like-aspartame-linked-to-16-years-of-extra-brain-aging-in-8-year-study-80669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging,” said senior author Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the Bakar Aging Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s study compared old and young male mice. In mouse terms, “old” means 18-22 months of age, and “young”, 2-3 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing in on the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/neurogenesis-confirmed-adult-brains-really-do-make-new-hippocampal-neurons-79875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; – the seahorse-shaped (if you squint) structure at the heart of the brain’s limbic system with vital roles in learning and memory – the team looked for any proteins that differed between the old and young mice. Helpfully, there was just one: FTL1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferritin light chain 1, to give it its full name, is involved in the long-term storage of iron, a vital nutrient. The team saw that its levels were increased in the aged brains, which they suggest in their paper is “likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that extra FTL1 could also negatively affect the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/mitochondria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, each cell’s own mini power station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their observations, they artificially increased levels of FTL1 in the brains of the young mice. Sure enough, their brains &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-is-the-age-when-your-brain-starts-aging-faster-and-it-starts-a-critical-window-78620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;began to appear older&lt;/a&gt;, and they exhibited behavioral signs consistent with advancing age on tests such as navigating a maze and recognizing objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did the same with mouse neuronal cells grown in Petri dishes. Those that had been engineered to produce lots of FTL1 had many fewer branches, or neurites, coming off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, the opposite was also true. When the FTL1 was artificially decreased in the brains of the older mice, their nerves began making lots of connections again, and they performed better on the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments,” said Villeda. “It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge, the team hopes to set the stage for new, targeted &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/anti-aging-breakthrough-as-scientists-reverse-aging-with-simple-drug-cocktail-69812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;anti-aging drugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age,” said Villeda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as helping stave off the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/more-evidence-that-a-daily-multivitamin-could-help-slow-cognitive-decline-in-old-age-72597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cognitive impacts&lt;/a&gt; of aging, they believe there could be more far-reaching consequences. Rare mutations in the &lt;em&gt;Ftl1 &lt;/em&gt;gene in humans cause a disease called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/neuroferritinopathy" target="_blank"&gt;neuroferritinopathy&lt;/a&gt;, where iron buildup in the brain causes progressive difficulties with movement, swallowing, and speaking. There’s also some evidence that iron metabolism is altered in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/alzheimer-s-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team concludes, “[O]ur data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 09:58:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNd09uaE4xU1FGTVF0OTlMTTV0RFJ5T25hMFA0THl2aExuWkhhUnRQOUphY0hSLXBJalI1aDFwenUyTXBHSUtUYUIyRHdDYjdiQ19vbkdCZW5sRlpIbDZhY25UWG9fUUVRNTZTVXQxbU5IMEhVSmFBTUpTRDBfcnZrNktZY3JXUVlsRHRZNm9jNzhtM2VfSW1aaHg5aUNyQlFwU2RuZGo4ZmR2cmQwVF9GWHlabHEzdXRCc3lmMFN2NA</guid></item><item><title>什么样的乳制品对身体有益？科学正在更新答案：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5528747/what-kind-of-dairy-does-a-body-good-science-is-updating-the-answer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When new dietary guidelines are unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/31/nx-s1-5519288/the-federal-government-will-issue-new-dietary-guidelines-heres-what-to-expect" target="_blank"&gt;later this month&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration is expected to upend long-held advice on whole milk and its full-fat friends in the dairy aisle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For decades, the American public has been advised to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy options, largely out of concern for limiting the intake of saturated fat in these foods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the public doesn't necessarily follow this advice — cheese is the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724000423?via%3Dihub#sec0007" target="_blank"&gt;leading source&lt;/a&gt; of saturated fat in our diet — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-makes-major-announcement-with-fda-and-international-dairy-foods-association" target="_blank"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to end the "attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt" and give these foods new prominence in the forthcoming guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, what's the case for ditching skim milk and other low-fat alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory?id=bruno.27" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human nutrition at the Ohio State University, says the field of nutrition has wrestled over this question for many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of controversy," says Bruno, who has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38669850/" target="_blank"&gt;authored&lt;/a&gt; numerous studies on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Views have evolved in recent years as researchers have started to learn "the saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that saturated fat is linked to heart disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because dairy is such a broad category — and fat content varies widely between foods like milk, yogurt and cheese — it's challenging to make sweeping statements. Yet, Bruno and others in the field say once you dig into the data, the rationale for an across-the-board recommendation to favor skim milk and low-fat dairy quickly falls away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we are saying that low fat is better than high fat, we should have studies demonstrating that, black and white, because guidelines should be evidence-based," says &lt;a href="https://iid.ulaval.ca/en/members/benoit-lamarche/" target="_blank"&gt;Benoît Lamarche&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec and is a professor at Université Laval.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's why Lamarche &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525001376?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;pulled together&lt;/a&gt; leaders in the field of nutrition last year, including several who had worked on dietary guidelines, to pour over the evidence on dairy fat and its link to cardiometabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The evidence is showing that they have the same effect and the evidence is of low quality and there's just a few studies that have looked at that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lamarche says the argument against full-fat dairy is largely "circumstantial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier research showed people who were at a higher risk of heart disease tended to have a dietary pattern that included more full-fat dairy, but there were other factors — and foods in their diet— that could explain this finding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't have the strict and rigorous evidence opposing the two types of dairy and their effect on health," he says. "We need to stop distracting people with this recommendation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some recent studies have even signaled that consuming higher-fat dairy is not only neutral, but, in some cases, &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; also carry benefits beyond low-fat options, at least when part of a healthy eating pattern.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523121368?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;small trial&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who followed the "&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" target="_blank"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt;" diet — developed by scientists at the National Institutes of Health to lower hypertension — and substituted high-fat dairy had comparable improvements in blood pressure as those who ate low-fat dairy and better blood lipid levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another study that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-017-0042-5" target="_blank"&gt;followed 18 adults&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for three weeks found drinking whole milk actually outperformed skim milk when it comes to raising HDL, or "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bruno says the hypothesis is that certain bioactive components in the milk fat membrane like phospholipids "alleviate any putative risks that would be associated with that higher intake of saturated fat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key, he says, seems to be how the dairy fat is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22030228/" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; butter — also derived from dairy but primarily composed of fat and water — has the predicted negative consequences on cholesterol; however, that's not true when people consume the same amount of saturated fat in the form of cheese, which comes with calcium, protein, minerals and other components.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Lamarche notes there's &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11704150/" target="_blank"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; from observational studies that cheese is associated with a lower risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is this real or confounded by something else?" he says. "We don't know, but the data is quite consistent on this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Likewise, there's a well-documented link between yogurt and the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, which led the Food and Drug Administration to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-announces-qualified-health-claim-yogurt-and-reduced-risk-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;issue a health claim&lt;/a&gt; on those products (though, of course, the universe of yogurt encompasses everything from whole milk Greek yogurt to sugar-loaded nonfat varieties).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724000423?via%3Dihub#sec0011" target="_blank"&gt;some recent trials&lt;/a&gt; examining higher-fat dairy products show promise, Bruno believes it's "premature to have a one-size-fits-all recommendation that consumers should favor full fat versus nonfat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even when it comes to milk, the evidence is slim in either direction, and Lamarche argues that guidance in the U.S. and Canada should be agnostic on the question for now, until there's better data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its reports, the scientific advisory committee that provides guidance for the federal government on the 2025 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Part%2520A_ExecutiveSummary_FINAL_508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;decided not to change the existing recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in support of low-fat milk because it "could not draw a conclusion about the relationship between consumption of milk with different fat content" — advice that Kennedy may very well ignore given his public comments disparaging the scientific report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/frank-b-hu/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Hu&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees there still aren't clear answers, meaning there's no reason to start promoting full-fat dairy as superior, especially since a glass of whole milk and cheese comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his mind though, the much bigger problem is that Americans are mostly consuming dairy products in the form of pizza, burgers, sandwiches and other foods that are "loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In that context, it probably doesn't make much difference if the cheese you are eating is low fat or high fat. On the other hand, it's relatively easy to "incorporate a moderate amount of dairy into your overall diet whether it's full fat or low fat," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're replacing your carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates and sugar, with dairy products, even some full-fat dairy products, that's probably a good thing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The rising number of people affected by this condition leads to multiple false beliefs about it which create confusion and potentially dangerous misunderstandings. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, recently took to his IG handle to bust 3 major myths about the condition. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: Fatty liver is caused by eating fat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People frequently believe that fatty liver disease develops because of consuming excessive fat in their diet. This is not true. Dr Sethi says that the main risk factors for developing fatty liver disease stem from consuming excessive amounts of sugary foods containing high fructose content, and unhealthy oils instead of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research together with expert doctors demonstrate that the liver benefits from fats, which come from sources like extra virgin olive oil, avocados and nuts. The main reason liver fat accumulation occurs, is because of consuming excessive amounts of processed sugars together with unhealthy oils instead of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention of sugar-rich foods and unhealthy oils takes precedence over fat avoidance in your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet that includes healthy fats serves as a method to support liver operation and maintain overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver is harmless&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief that fatty liver disease presents no risk to health and does not need medical attention is completely incorrect. This is false. According to Dr Sethi, the progression of fatty liver disease remains hidden until it causes severe damage to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive liver fat accumulation above 5% of liver weight, results in inflammation and scarring that can progress to liver failure when left untreated. The progression of NAFLD through NASH to fibrosis and cirrhosis, represents three dangerous stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of symptoms in people with fatty liver disease makes it difficult to detect the condition at an early stage. Research demonstrates that untreated fatty liver disease raises the chances of developing liver cancer and fatal liver disease stages. The detection of fatty liver disease at an early stage, requires immediate attention to diet and exercise for proper management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: Supplements serve as essential treatment for fatty liver&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi says that many people think supplements play a vital role in treating fatty liver disease, but this belief holds some inaccuracies. The primary treatment for fatty liver disease consists of diet and exercise, although some supplements including milk thistle, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine, show potential benefits for liver &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://liver.org.au/your-liver/liver-diseases/fatty-liver-disease/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that eating unprocessed foods and cutting back on sugary foods and unhealthy oils, leads to substantial liver health improvements. Physical exercise combined with weight reduction, helps patients eliminate liver fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements function best when used as part of a complete treatment plan, but they do not function as standalone solutions for fatty liver disease. Medical supervision becomes necessary when using supplements, because they can produce adverse effects and interact with prescribed medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention of fatty liver disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People

data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Healthy eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet that includes

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing a significant amount of weight can often seem like an overwhelming challenge, especially for busy professionals juggling demanding careers and personal commitments. Dr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sudhir-kumar" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sudhir Kumar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a neurologist from Hyderabad, experienced this struggle firsthand when his weight reached 100 kilograms. However, through steady, practical lifestyle changes, he managed to shed 30 kilograms over two years — a transformation that not only changed his physical appearance but also his overall health and confidence. Dr. Kumar’s journey, shared openly on social media, offers valuable insights and inspiration for anyone hoping to make lasting changes without resorting to extreme diets or grueling exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="4470428" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-journey" source="Orion"&gt;fitness journey&lt;/keyword&gt;: Overcoming &lt;keyword id="28749874" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-struggles" source="Orion"&gt;weight struggles&lt;/keyword&gt; amid a busy schedule revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting his fitness journey in late 2020, Dr. Kumar found himself trapped in a cycle that many people struggling with weight can relate to. His work as a neurologist demanded 16 to 17-hour days, leaving very little time for self-care. The long hours meant he often slept just 4 to 5 hours a night, which severely impacted his energy levels and metabolism. On top of this, his diet was far from ideal — frequent overeating, regular consumption of junk food, sugary snacks, and soft drinks added fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physically, the consequences were evident. Walking even five kilometers was a major challenge for him, and he experienced difficulty with stamina and endurance. It was clear that drastic changes were needed, but they had to fit into the reality of a busy medical professional’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How limiting work hours enabled Dr. Kumar to focus on &lt;keyword id="865258" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-and-nutrition" source="Orion"&gt;fitness and nutrition&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important changes Dr. Kumar made was to significantly reduce his working hours. By limiting his workday to 8-9 hours, he was able to reclaim precious time to focus on his health and well-being. This shift was crucial because it not only reduced stress but also allowed him to prioritize exercise and proper meal preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people underestimate the impact of work-life balance on health. Dr. Kumar’s example highlights how setting boundaries around work can directly contribute to better physical and mental wellness, making it easier to adopt and maintain healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How better sleep helped Dr. Kumar regulate appetite and boost metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of Dr. Kumar’s transformation was improving his sleep quality. Increasing his nightly sleep to 7-8 hours was a game changer. Sleep plays a vital role in regulating the hormones that control hunger and fullness. Without adequate rest, the body tends to produce more ghrelin (which increases appetite) and less leptin (which signals fullness), making it harder to avoid overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sleep supports metabolic health, aids muscle recovery, and boosts mental clarity — all of which are essential for maintaining an active lifestyle and making good dietary choices. By prioritizing sleep, Dr. Kumar laid a solid foundation for sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How cutting refined carbs and increasing protein aids lasting weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to nutrition, Dr. Kumar took a balanced and realistic approach. He stopped drinking soft drinks altogether and cut down drastically on junk food and sugary treats, which are often major contributors to unwanted weight gain. Instead of following a fad diet, he focused on reducing his carbohydrate intake — especially refined carbs — while increasing the amount of protein he consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is known to help keep you feeling full longer and helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. This thoughtful adjustment in his diet allowed Dr. Kumar to shed pounds without feeling deprived or hungry, making the changes sustainable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How consistent running helped him lose weight and improve his health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar didn’t rush into intense exercise. He started slow, walking five kilometers even though it was difficult at first. Over the course of several weeks, he gradually increased his distance to 10 kilometers, building endurance at a comfortable pace. Eventually, he transitioned into slow jogging and then running, focusing more on how long he stayed active rather than how fast he went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach helped him avoid injury and burnout. Later, in December 2022, he added strength training sessions three times a week, which helped build muscle, improve metabolism, and further enhance his body composition. The combination of aerobic activity and resistance training proved to be a winning formula for his sustained weight loss. Over time, Dr. Kumar’s dedication to running became apparent through the impressive distances he covered. In 2021, he averaged 15 kilometers per day, completed 339 runs of 10 kilometers or more, ran 69 half marathons, and even completed a full marathon. The following year, while slightly reducing his daily average to 12.6 kilometers, he still managed 304 runs of 10 kilometers or more, along with 43 half marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical transformation was impressive, but Dr. Kumar experienced benefits far beyond the number on the scale. Losing 30 kilograms brought a remarkable increase in energy and stamina. He reported feeling more focused and productive in both his professional and personal life.

His resting heart rate dropped from 72 to an impressively low 40-42 beats per minute, indicating better cardiovascular fitness.

But until scientists can deliver its gene-editing machinery safely and efficiently into relevant cells and tissues, that promise will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Northwestern University chemists have unveiled a new type of nanostructure that dramatically improves CRISPR delivery and potentially extends its scope of utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called lipid nanoparticle spherical nucleic acids (LNP-SNAs), these tiny structures carry the full set of CRISPR editing tools -- Cas9 enzymes, guide RNA and a DNA repair template -- wrapped in a dense, protective shell of DNA. Not only does this DNA coating shield its cargo, but it also dictates which organs and tissues the LNP-SNAs travel to and makes it easier for them to enter cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lab tests across various human and animal cell types, the LNP-SNAs entered cells up to three times more effectively than the standard lipid particle delivery systems used for COVID-19 vaccines, caused far less toxicity and boosted gene-editing efficiency threefold. The new nanostructures also improved the success rate of precise DNA repairs by more than 60% compared to current methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published on Sept. 5 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study paves the way for safer, more reliable genetic medicines and underscores the importance of how a nanomaterial's structure -- rather than its ingredients alone -- can determine its potency. This principle underlies structural nanomedicine, an emerging field pioneered by Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin and his colleagues and pursued by hundreds of researchers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CRISPR is an incredibly powerful tool that could correct defects in genes to decrease susceptibility to disease and even eliminate disease itself," said Mirkin, who led the new study. "But it's difficult to get CRISPR into the cells and tissues that matter. Reaching and entering the right cells -- and the right places within those cells -- requires a minor miracle. By using SNAs to deliver the machinery required for gene editing, we aimed to maximize CRISPR's efficiency and expand the number of cell and tissue types that we can deliver it to."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nanotechnology and nanomedicine pioneer, Mirkin is the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; professor of chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering; professor of medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine; executive director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology; and a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR needs a ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CRISPR machinery reaches its target inside a cell, it can disable genes, fix mutations, add new functions and more. But CRISPR machinery cannot enter cells by itself. It always needs a delivery vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, scientists typically use viral vectors and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to perform this function. Naturally good at sneaking into cells, viruses are efficient, but they can cause the human body to mount an immune response, leading to painful or even dangerous side effects. LNPs, on the other hand, are safer but inefficient. They tend to get stuck in endosomes, or compartments within the cell, where they cannot release their cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Only a fraction of the CRISPR machinery actually makes it into the cell and even a smaller fraction makes it all the way into the nucleus," Mirkin said. "Another strategy is to remove cells from the body, inject the CRISPR components and then put the cells back in. As you can imagine, that's extremely inefficient and impractical."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DNA-wrapped taxi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this barrier, Mirkin's team turned to SNAs, which are globular -- rather than linear -- forms of DNA and RNA previously invented in Mirkin's lab at Northwestern. The spherical genetic material surrounds a nanoparticle core, which can be packed with cargo. Roughly 50 nanometers in diameter, the tiny structures possess a proven ability to enter cells for targeted delivery. Seven SNA-based therapies are already in human clinical trials, including a Phase 2 clinical trial for Merkel cell carcinoma being developed by Flashpoint Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Mirkin's team started with an LNP core carrying the CRISPR machinery inside. Then, they decorated the particle's surface with a dense layer of short strands of DNA. Because the DNA can interact with a cell's surface receptors, cells easily absorb SNAs. The DNA also can be engineered with sequences that target specific cell types, making delivery more selective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simple changes to the particle's structure can dramatically change how well a cell takes it up," Mirkin said. "The SNA architecture is recognized by almost all cell types, so cells actively take up the SNAs and rapidly internalize them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosted performance across the board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully synthesizing LNP-SNAs with CRISPR cargo, Mirkin and his team added them to cellular cultures, which included skin cells, white blood cells, human bone marrow stem cells and human kidney cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the team observed and measured several key factors: how efficiently the cells internalized the particles, whether the particles were toxic to cells and if the particles successfully delivered a gene. They also analyzed the cells' DNA to determine if CRISPR had made the desired gene edits. In every category, the system demonstrated its ability to successfully deliver CRISPR machinery and enable complex genetic modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Mirkin plans to further validate the system in multiple in vivo disease models. Because the platform is modular, researchers can adapt it for a wide range of systems and therapeutic applications. Northwestern biotechnology spin-out Flashpoint Therapeutics is commercializing the technology with the goal of rapidly moving it toward clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CRISPR could change the whole field of medicine," Mirkin said. "But how we design the delivery vehicle is just as important as the genetic tools themselves. By marrying two powerful biotechnologies -- CRISPR and SNAs -- we have created a strategy that could unlock CRISPR's full therapeutic potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "A general genome editing strategy using CRISPR lipid nanoparticle spherical nucleic acids," was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (award number FA9550-22-1-0300), the National Science Foundation (award number DMR-2428112) and Edgar H. Bachrach through the Bachrach Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to happy tunes helped study participants with motion sickness get over their predisposition and recover better, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motion sickness is a common condition that happens when you’re moving while sitting still, such as riding in a car. It occurs when our eyes, inner ear and body send conflicting messages to the brain, resulting in nausea, headaches, or breaking out in a cold sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Chinese scientists studying ways for improving the condition have &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1636109/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published a study in&lt;/a&gt; the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience showing that playing different types of music may help people recover more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a specially calibrated driving simulator, they induced car sickness in participants and then played different types of music while they tried to recover. Soft and joyful music produced the best recovery effects, while sad tunes were even less effective than doing nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said study author&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Qizong Yue of Southwest University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers explained that feeling tense in anticipation of possible car sickness can trigger a physical reaction, bringing sickness on more quickly. Because music can be used to alleviate tension, Dr Yue and his team wondered if it could help people who get carsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team began by developing a model to induce motion sickness. They recruited 40 participants to screen routes on a driving simulator and chose the most effective route for making people feel carsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 people who reported moderate levels of previous carsickness then wore electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, to try to identify quantifiable signals of carsickness in the brain’s activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Just 1-Minute Daily Exposure to Specific Sound Frequency Can Alleviate Motion Sickness: New Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/just-1-minute-daily-exposure-to-specific-sound-frequency-can-alleviate-motion-sickness/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Just 1-Minute Daily Exposure to Specific Sound Frequency Can Alleviate Motion Sickness: New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were divided into six groups – four that received a music intervention, one that received no music, and one whose simulators were stopped when they started to report that they might feel slightly carsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last group acted as a comparative sample for the EEG data. They had received the same stimuli as the other 25 participants, but weren’t allowed to become nauseous, so the difference between their brain activity and the other participants’ would help identify signals characteristic of carsickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the participants sat still in the simulator for a few minutes to capture EEG signals from their brains. Then they performed a driving task and reported their level of carsickness to the research team. Once they stopped driving, the participants in the music groups were played tunes for 60 seconds, and then asked to report how sick they felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joyful music alleviated carsickness by 57%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that joyful music alleviated carsickness the most, reducing it by 57.3%—followed very closely by soft music, at 56.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passionate music reduced motion sickness by 48.3%, while playing sad music turned out to be slightly worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group reported a reduction of carsickness symptoms by 43.3% after their rest, while those who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLISTIC SOLUTION TO MOTION SICKNESS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Woman Makes Drug-free Patches That Treat Nausea, Cramps, Vertigo, Hangovers – And Even Car Sick Pets" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/gopatch-drug-free-patches-for-nausea-and-cramps/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Woman Makes Drug-free Patches That Treat Nausea, Cramps, Vertigo, Hangovers – And Even Car Sick Pets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EEG data showed that participants’ brain activity in the occipital lobe changed when they reported carsickness, measureing less complex activity in this brain region when participants said they felt quite sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better the said they felt as they recovered, the more the activity measured by the EEG returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joyful or soft music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe it’s possible that soft music relaxes people, relieving the tension that exacerbates carsickness, while joyful music might distract people by activating brain reward systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sad music could have the opposite effect, by amplifying negative emotions and increasing overall discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KINDNESS IN THE END&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Caring Ambulance Workers Take Detour to Grant Dying Man’s Simple Ice Cream Wish" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/aussie-ambulance-workers-grant-dying-mans-ice-cream-wish/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Caring Ambulance Workers Take Detour to Grant Dying Man’s Simple Ice Cream Wish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say further work with a larger sample size is needed to confirm the results. They plan to follow up the experiments with investigations of different forms of travel-sickness and the role played by personal musical taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” said Dr. Yue, who believes the findings of this study would “likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel,” as well.&lt;/p&gt;

And managing those family bonds required more brainpower, which may have led to greater intelligence and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some other animals couple up in similar ways to humans, most don’t, so love may be one of the missing links that helped us evolve from apes to us. But in order to persuade our less-evolved ancestors to share responsibilities (and food) with another person, love had to have some pretty huge benefits — like the nine listed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If two people are truly in love, they'll unlock these pretty awesome health perks:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

Today, about 57 million people live with dementia worldwide, and Alzheimer’s disease causes most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors rely on interviews, brief cognitive checks, and brain scans when available. A clinically available blood test now offers another option that is simple, fast, and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-flagging-alzheimer-s-in-blood"&gt;Flagging Alzheimer’s in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team was led by Sebastian Palmqvist at &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden. Their goal was clear: make an accurate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-blood-test-can-track-the-progression-of-alzheimers/"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; that a regular clinic can use to flag Alzheimer’s biology in people with memory concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a prospective study of 1,213 patients seen in both family practices and specialty memory clinics, a serum panel correctly identified Alzheimer’s pathology about 88 to 92 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That performance was on par with the accuracy seen when samples were analyzed in batches or as they arrived, which matches how clinics actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test looks for a specific biomarker in plasma called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10066514/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphorylated tau 217&lt;/a&gt;, often shortened to p-tau217. It also reads the ratio of amyloid beta 42 to amyloid beta 40, two forms of a protein linked to plaques in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements rise or fall in characteristic ways when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-simple-nighttime-sleep-habit-could-delay-or-prevent-alzheimers-in-all-adults/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology is present. By combining them, the test gives a single probability score that tracks the biology behind memory loss, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-help-for-primary-care-doctors"&gt;Help for primary care doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary care doctors’ accuracy in identifying Alzheimer’s disease was 61 per cent, while specialist physicians were correct 73 per cent of the time,” added &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/sebastian-palmqvist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sebastian Palmqvist&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor of Neurology at Lund University and consultant at &lt;a href="https://vard.skane.se/psykiatri-skane/mottagningar-och-avdelningar/akutmottagning-barn--och-ungdomspsykiatri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Skåne&lt;/a&gt; University Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the test’s performance with doctors’ best clinical judgment before any biomarker results were known and those numbers show why an easy lab test can help the first clinicians who see most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier and more accurate classification steers people to the right next step. It also reduces unnecessary referrals for expensive imaging when the blood test rules out Alzheimer’s biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-aps2-score"&gt;Inside the APS2 score&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab algorithm, sometimes called APS2, blends the p-tau217 percentage with the amyloid ratio to estimate the chance of amyloid positivity in the brain. Ratios help account for unrelated medical factors that can nudge a single marker up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02869-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that percent p-tau217 in blood closely matches the clinical performance of Food and Drug Administration (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;) cleared cerebrospinal fluid tests for detecting Alzheimer’s pathology. Accuracy climbs even higher when labs use two cutoff values, one to rule in and one to rule out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians will still need other information in some cases. A subgroup will land in an intermediate zone, which is a cue to order a PET scan or repeat testing rather than guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-current-treatments"&gt;How this fits with current treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments that target amyloid require proof of amyloid biology before they start. The FDA granted traditional approval for &lt;em&gt;lecanemab&lt;/em&gt;, marketed as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-converts-novel-alzheimers-disease-treatment-traditional-approval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leqembi&lt;/a&gt;, for early symptomatic Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also approved &lt;em&gt;donanemab&lt;/em&gt;, now sold as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kisunla&lt;/a&gt;, for adults with early symptoms and confirmed amyloid pathology. As access to these drugs grows, fast triage in regular clinics becomes more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test is already available in the USA and is likely to become available in many other countries soon. Initially, it will mainly be used in specialist memory clinics, and it may take approximately one to two years to implement guidelines and training in primary care,” concluded &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/oskar-hansson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oskar Hansson&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Neurology at Lund University and senior consultant at Skåne University Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood draw in a familiar clinic setting lowers the barrier for people who cannot travel far or wait long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-blood-and-healthcare"&gt;Alzheimer’s, blood, and healthcare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine blood test is less invasive than a cerebrospinal fluid tap and easier to schedule than advanced imaging. Results can arrive quickly, which helps families move from uncertainty to a clear plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accurate negative result can spare people from months of worry and unnecessary tests. A positive result, combined with a clinical assessment, helps providers arrange the right counseling, safety steps, and referrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test does not replace a full evaluation. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brains-quiet-moments-may-shape-memory-and-fight-alzheimers/"&gt;Memory&lt;/a&gt; changes can come from depression, sleep problems, medications, or other neurological diseases, so clinicians still need to take a careful history and examine the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No test is perfect. A small fraction of results will fall between the lower and upper cutoffs, and that gray zone is best handled with follow up testing or specialty referral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local policies will shape how primary clinics use the assay alongside cognitive exams and imaging. Training and clear workflows will help teams decide when to test, how to interpret results, and when to refer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will keep studying how comorbid conditions, age, and disease stage affect performance. Automated platforms and standardized reporting should make it easier for labs to deliver consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:16:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNUzhac0pPbDc1X28tMXRJQndSd3RHaE9hS0lQQ05LWDBRN1hMOHhLLTFiU3loTHMyMGxwOENzTDA1SVRoVVR6dGJJMnJfN0xtWXBtNGtEbjhFQTM5RDR3Y2d0T1ZCeHdGRmNxQTNJWXdpZWpkNkxaMGFub1J2NGhiOG9qdkgwSlR4aHF4anlyQlVONXpPdjVLZ0NhMUZlNVdEdEZkY0U0Um9tcWdIRlRyZUNPTQ</guid></item><item><title>100%有效的癌症疫苗？俄罗斯的Enteromix在试验中取得成功；以下是完整的报告-《经济时报》</title><link>https://m.economictimes.com/news/new-updates/a-100-effective-cancer-vaccine-russias-enteromix-achieves-success-in-trials-heres-the-full-report-you-need-to-read/articleshow/123749832.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-brcount="21" class="artText"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine that could change the way we fight cancer is making headlines. Russia’s Enteromix has reportedly achieved 100% efficacy in preclinical trials, showing both safety and strong tumour-fighting abilities, according to a report by Tass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veronika Skvortsova, head of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency (FMBA), revealed the results at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_123749832" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-123749832"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research spanned several years, with the last three dedicated to mandatory preclinical studies. The vaccine is now ready for use; we are awaiting official approval,” Tass quoted her as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skvortsova stressed that repeated administration of the vaccine remained safe, while also showing impressive results. Tumour growth slowed by 60–80%, survival rates improved, and significant reductions in tumour size were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First target: colorectal cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine’s initial focus will be on colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. But the research does not stop there. Scientists are also developing versions for glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumour, and specific types of melanoma, including ocular melanoma, all of which are at advanced stages of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_123749832" id="div-vdoai-mid-123749832"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate vaccines with childhood diseases such as measles or chickenpox. These train the immune system to recognise dangerous germs. Cancer vaccines work on a similar principle, but instead of viruses, they help the body spot and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-123749832" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, some cancer vaccines already exist for bladder and prostate cancers, while the HPV vaccine prevents several types of cancer before they begin. Enteromix, however, belongs to a growing line of therapeutic vaccines designed to treat cancer directly, making the body’s natural defences more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123749832" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123749832" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-123749832" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global stage for a breakthrough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came during the 10th Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok (3–6 September), where over 8,400 delegates from 75 countries gathered under the theme “The Far East: Cooperation for Peace and Prosperity.” More than 100 thematic sessions were held, but it was Enteromix that stole the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If approved, this Russian vaccine could be a milestone in the fight against one of the world’s deadliest diseases, potentially reshaping cancer treatment as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inputs from ANI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:07:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>4种比一杯酸奶含有更多钙的健康零食- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/healthy-snacks-that-have-more-calcium-than-a-cup-of-yogurt-11803455</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium supports bone, heart, muscle, and nerve health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recommended amount of calcium for adults is 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say chia seed pudding, green smoothies, canned sardines with cheese and calcium-fortified cereal with milk provide even more calcium than a cup of yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you open the fridge to look for a snack, what’s the first thing you are reaching for? For many, the answer is yogurt! There’s plenty to love about yogurt—it’s a creamy and satisfying snack option that also offers a variety of health benefits, from improved digestion to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention all of the essential nutrients—like calcium—that it provides. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;up their calcium intake&lt;/a&gt; (a lot of us aren’t getting enough), it makes sense that yogurt is often a top pick. The recommended daily amount of calcium for adults is 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams, and just 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt provides 488 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beyond calcium’s well-known role in bone health, your heart, muscles and nerves also need this essential mineral to function properly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But if you’re tired of your daily yogurt bowl, it isn’t the only high-calcium snack option out there. Here are some other dietitian-recommended healthy snacks that have more calcium than a cup of yogurt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-healthy-snacks-that-have-more-calcium-than-a-cup-of-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4 Healthy Snacks That Have More Calcium Than a Cup of Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Sardines with Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tuna isn’t the only snackable seafood—sardines are another tasty fish that deserves a spot in your lineup. Not only are they a great &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, sardines are especially rich in calcium too. “Most of the calcium in our bodies—more than 99%—is stored in our bones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And that’s true for fish as well. Sardine bones are soft and edible, so when you enjoy sardines, you’re loading up on the calcium stored in their skeleton,” says &lt;a href="https://www.alyssanorthrop.com/about-alyssa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Alyssa Northrop, M.P.H., RD, LMT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A can of sardines provides as much as 351 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While that’s just shy of the total calcium you’ll score from a cup of yogurt, you can easily boost it by adding some cheese. One ounce of Cheddar cheese provides 199 mg calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A tasty way to enjoy sardines is to make sardine crackers by layering a cracker, sharp Cheddar cheese and sardines,” suggests &lt;a href="https://delightfullyfueled.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Alsing, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Chia Seed Pudding &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds don’t just help you poop, they are also surprisingly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7944380/easy-high-calcium-dinner-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in calcium&lt;/a&gt;. Just 1 ounce of chia seeds—about 2 tablespoons—provides 179 mg calcium or 14% of your daily needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soaking the chia seeds in milk to create the pudding adds even more calcium to the tally. Of course, any mix-ins you include to add more protein or flavor may also tack on more calcium. For example, this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-blueberry-peanut-butter-chia-pudding-11713745" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein blueberry and peanut butter chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; provides an impressive 729 mg of calcium for a breakfast-size portion, but even pared down a little for snacking it still has an edge over plain yogurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Cereal and Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Good news for cereal lovers—this convenient breakfast option also makes a great calcium-rich snack, especially when you add a splash of milk. Here’s the rundown. A serving of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/153679/how-to-pick-the-healthiest-breakfast-cereal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-fortified toasted oats cereal&lt;/a&gt; offers around 100 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But once you add 1 cup of low-fat milk, the calcium total for this snack goes up to an impressive 414 mg calcium or 32% of the daily recommendation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, dairy milk isn’t the only milk that can boost the calcium in your bowl. Nondairy alternatives like soy, almond and even oat milk are often fortified with calcium to help you score enough in your diet. For example, a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/almond-milk-health-benefits-8387408" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-fortified almond milk&lt;/a&gt; will provide a whopping 422 mg per cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Per &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, “This is also a great choice for those requiring a dairy-free option.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Green Smoothie &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dark leafy greens are a rich source of calcium, but munching on a handful of greens for a snack isn’t very appealing. One simple way to make them more palatable is to toss a handful into a smoothie. And if you include other calcium-rich ingredients in the mix, like chia seeds and calcium-fortified almond milk, it can really add up! If you need some inspiration, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/green-smoothie-11778323" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green smoothie recipe&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a whopping 676 mg of calcium per serving—that’s more than half the recommended calcium for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-notable-mentions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Notable Mentions &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If none of those calcium-rich snacks suit your taste buds, our dietitians had a few other notable snack mentions that are worth entertaining:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortified orange juice&lt;/strong&gt;: “I recommend fortified orange juice—many brands provide 300 mg of calcium in an 8-ounce glass, and it’s an easy, familiar choice for kids and adults,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that you can even freeze it into popsicle molds for a frozen treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mozzarella cheese snack plate: &lt;/strong&gt;Create a simple snack plate that’s packed with calcium by combining one stick of mozzarella string cheese, 1 ounce of unsalted almonds, and 1 cup of blackberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This easy-to-assemble combo racks up the calcium, providing about 325 mg or about 25% of your daily needs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canned salmon:&lt;/strong&gt; Sardines aren’t the only canned fish that’s packed with calcium. “Canned salmon is a convenient, high-calcium, high-protein and omega-3-rich snack that can be enjoyed as a sandwich, salmon patties or straight out of the can,” says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. One can of pink salmon and bones provides up to 302 mg of calcium, about 23% of the recommended daily intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tofu chocolate pudding:&lt;/strong&gt; Tofu can be an unexpectedly good source of calcium, since many brands use calcium sulfate to help solidify the soy milk to make tofu. For example, 1 cup of firm tofu provides as much as 506 mg calcium, or almost 40% of your daily needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Per &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, M.A.N., RD&lt;/a&gt;, one way to use tofu in a snack is to blend it into a pudding with calcium-fortified plant-based milk, cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla and a dash of salt. Snacking on a half-cup of this pudding provides over 200 mg of calcium. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is likely one of the first snack foods that comes to mind when you need to increase your calcium intake. But if you’re feeling bored with your daily yogurt snack, there are plenty of other options that provide just as much (if not more!) calcium. Dietitians suggest adding chia pudding, green smoothies, canned sardines with cheese and calcium-fortified cereal with milk to your snack rotation. You’ll be adding plenty of variety to banish boredom and hit the mark on the recommended daily intake of this essential nutrient.&lt;br&gt;
