							&lt;div class="intro"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something fascinating about watching someone in their seventies navigate a smartphone with more ease than their middle-aged children. Or the grandfather who picks up conversational Spanish just because.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These signs of something deeper—a kind of mental resilience that has less to do with luck and more to do with how you approach everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Learning new things for no practical reason&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neighbor is 73 and just started learning to play piano. Not because she needs to, not because anyone's watching. She heard something that made her curious and went for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When older adults take on genuinely new skills—woodworking, astronomy, a language—their brains show increased activity in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8151174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;memory networks&lt;/a&gt; that usually quiet down with age. The trick is that it has to be *new*. Doing the same crossword format you've done for twenty years doesn't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Actually wanting to hear what younger people think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some septuagenarians talk to their kids and grandkids out of obligation. Others are genuinely curious what a 25-year-old thinks about dating apps or the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That curiosity across generations keeps something important flexible in the brain. Research shows that older adults with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/bonds-that-transcend-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;age-diverse friendships&lt;/a&gt; do better on tests of mental agility. You're literally exercising your ability to see from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Figuring out tech without having a meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, nobody loves it when their bank changes the app interface again. The difference is in how you respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp 70-somethings treat confusing technology like a puzzle rather than a personal insult. They poke around, ask questions, maybe get frustrated but keep going. That willingness to experiment matters. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266703212300001X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Technology use&lt;/a&gt; in older adults tracks with better executive function—your ability to plan, focus, and juggle tasks. The tech itself is less important than the mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Being willing to be wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who spent decades convinced butter was terrible for you, then read new research and just... changed her mind. No drama, no doubling down. Just "huh, I guess I was wrong about that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people get more rigid in their thinking as they age. But being able to update your beliefs when you learn something new? That's a sign your brain is still operating at a high level. The willingness to be wrong keeps your mind loose in ways that matter for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Getting randomly curious about weird topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're at dinner and someone mentions how octopuses think, and instead of politely nodding you actually want to know more. Or you hear about some historical event and find yourself Googling it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That instinct to follow curiosity—even when it's impractical—predicts how well your brain ages. The 70-year-olds who are still wondering "why" and "how" about random things are keeping neural pathways active. Curiosity isn't just nice to have; it's doing actual work in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Doing things that feel a little awkward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people's comfort zones shrink over time. Fewer new restaurants, fewer unfamiliar places, fewer situations where you might look foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitively sharp ones lean the other way. Travel somewhere you don't speak the language. Try a cuisine that seems bizarre. Go to a lecture on something you know nothing about. These novel experiences create what's called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;—your brain forming new connections. Mild discomfort is actually good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Reading or watching things that make you think hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's entertainment that washes over you, and there's stuff that makes your brain work. Long articles about evolution or economics. Documentaries where you can't check your phone. Books that require real attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you regularly engage with complex ideas, you're building something called crystallized intelligence. Unlike other cognitive abilities that fade, this one can actually get stronger if you keep challenging it. The catch is you have to actually challenge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Still giving a damn about what happens next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one's subtle. It's not about forced optimism. It's about maintaining real interest in the future—what your grandkids will do with their lives, how technology might change things, plans you want to make for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When older adults keep that forward-looking mindset, they perform better on cognitive tests. It's like your brain needs something to reach toward. The moment someone decides the interesting part is over, things start to slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this guarantees anything—genetics matter, and brains are complicated. But these habits definitely stack the deck in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most is how simple these things are. Not expensive supplements or complicated programs. Just staying curious, staying open, refusing to let your world get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 70-year-olds with unusually sharp minds aren't doing anything mysterious. They're just still interested. Still learning. Still reaching for what they don't understand yet. That reaching might be the whole game.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="editor-note__prefix"&gt;EDITOR’S NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;  The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;a href="https://swap.fm/l/cldw101425" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsjybhb001w27nn22wic507@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;Nobody ever wants to hear they have cancer, but when it strikes a young person, the news is perhaps even more devastating because everything about the future they were imagining and working toward is thrown into question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00023b6nzwrrpv0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, early-onset cancer —  disease   in people younger than 50 years old — is being &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/early-onset-cancer-increase"&gt;diagnosed more frequently&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12082829/" target="_blank"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;. And among early-onset cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/health/colorectal-cancer-statistics-2023-report/index.html"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; hovers near the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9177054/" target="_blank"&gt;top of the list&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00033b6ngkk7j59e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was shocking to see that a young person — perfectly fit and healthy, no risk factors, no family history — could be diagnosed with Stage 4 disease. And then it just became more and more common, which is also distressing,” Dr. Kimmie Ng told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00043b6n5fd9epcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ng, a gastrointestinal oncologist and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has been treating patients for two decades at Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she is the founding director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center, one of the nation’s first centers that treat younger adults with the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00053b6n08193x21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The incidence of both colon and rectal cancer has been increasing by about 2% per year in younger people since the mid-1990s, Ng said, noting that it’s happening to both men and women, not just across the United States but globally, too.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgskb62a000t3b6nje3v4pkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s difficult to receive a cancer diagnosis no matter what age you are, but younger people face really different challenges,” Ng said. “Eighty percent have children under the age of 18. They’re also caring for elderly parents. They’re in the midst of their careers. Some people are still getting education. Some people are still planning to expand their families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsldczr00083b6n83to3p0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmgsleds8000c3b6nyfqbzhlu@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsl8im600003b6nijt494s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early-onset colorectal cancer is already the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in men &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21820" target="_blank"&gt;younger than age 50&lt;/a&gt;, and if the trend continues, Ng said, it will become the leading cause of cancer death in women under 50 by 2030. (After breast cancer, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause in younger women now.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslfz5u000i3b6nmwz8l2f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She points out, however, that in absolute numbers, these cancer cases in younger people are “still quite small,” noting “it is still relatively rare to develop any of these cancers at a really young age.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslfz5u000j3b6nl4glc8b1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across all ages, colorectal cancer cases and related deaths in the US have been declining for decades, Ng said, attributing that success to improvements in treatment and public health efforts to promote screening. “But that benefit has not been seen in people under the age of 50,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgskfvcs000w3b6nvhwrbjt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;US Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt;, an independent board of medical experts, lowered the recommended age to start screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic people of average risk from 50 years old to 45.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000m3b6n3rbftqrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Ng doubts the panel will lower the age again soon, noting not only the relatively small absolute numbers but also other factors that go into implementing a successful screening program, such as cost and the risks associated with screening, including bleeding, sedation complications and false positives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000n3b6n1ceizw7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, Ng believes the focus should be on figuring out why this surge in early-onset colorectal cancer is happening. “What are the risk factors?” she said. “Who is at risk, and can we tailor that high-risk 30-year-old for earlier screening?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000o3b6njtzj3tsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also important: More people need to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-trend"&gt;get screened. &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000p3b6n10fitjoy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There was this effort to get 80% of the population screened in the United States, but we haven’t yet reached that goal,” Ng said. “And so it is really important that we continue public health efforts to really advocate that screening can be lifesaving and it really needs to be done.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsljzg600163b6nsiagyw7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What do you need to know about early-onset colorectal cancer? Ng shares five things that matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000s3b6nh47huqrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many types of cancer are rising among young people around the world, Ng told CNN via email, but cancers of the digestive system are rising most rapidly. That includes colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and biliary tract cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000t3b6nvycd9rku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early detection is critical. And knowing the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/signs-and-symptoms-of-colon-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;red-flag symptoms&lt;/a&gt; associated with colorectal cancer is essential, Ng said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslv5yj00283b6nxjjgldfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For young people … the most predominant presenting symptom is seeing blood in the stool. For example, if you see blood that’s actually mixed into the stool rather than sitting on top of it or in the toilet bowl or just on the toilet paper. If it’s mixed in the stool, that’s perhaps a little bit more concerning and a little bit more characteristic of a malignant cause.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000u3b6nq49ed9g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unintentional weight loss is another red-flag symptom, Ng added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000v3b6nha2rywh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common symptoms include prolonged changes in bowel habits, such as new diarrhea or new constipation, thinner stools and abdominal pain. In addition, fatigue could indicate anemia or low red blood cell counts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000w3b6ni18asc8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter how uncomfortable these conversations might be, Ng said it is crucial to discuss any changes in bowel habits with your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p00193b6n656r92az@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With each generation, the risk has gone up, Ng observed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001a3b6n5tdrfuio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The increase in young-onset cancers is generational, with every generation after 1950 experiencing rising incidence,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001b3b6nruu4qs8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For example, someone born in 1990 now has &amp;gt;4x (greater than four times) the risk of developing rectal cancer and &amp;gt;2x (greater than two times) the risk of developing colon cancer compared to a similarly-aged person who was born in 1950.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001c3b6nuw0f32nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we see these … effects, what it usually suggests is that there’s some environmental exposure or exposures that have happened recently that are contributing to that rise,” Ng told Gupta on the podcast. “So, the big question now is what are these things that are actually leading to this increasing incidence in young people?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001d3b6nfnity0i6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have been trying to pinpoint the drivers of   this unsettling trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001e3b6n1hqqeiza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The cause of the rising rates of young-onset cancers is thought to be due to environmental factors,” Ng said, noting that our genes could not have changed so much in 30 years to be the culprit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001f3b6np01m5oe4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Environmental factors might include obesity, sedentary behavior, and diets that are high in red meat, processed foods, added sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001g3b6n3wd5wn8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The leading hypothesis has been obesity,” Ng told Gupta, adding that the obesity rates   in the US, which “have been skyrocketing in recent decades,” seem to parallel the rise in young-onset gastrointestinal    cancers, which include colorectal cancer. Obesity increases body-wide &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/health/colon-cancer-omega-6-ultraprocessed-food-wellness"&gt;inflammation, which can set the stage&lt;/a&gt; for precancerous changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Nevertheless, Ng said, most younger colorectal cancer patients she and her colleagues are seeing are not obese. “Many are marathon runners, they’re triathletes, they’re eating really healthy, they eat organic — and yet they’re still being diagnosed with young-onset   colorectal cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001i3b6nau8ln0ni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The influence of other environmental factors are still being studied, Ng said, citing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; as one example. Exposure to toxins and diet in the first decade of life can also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40691977/" target="_blank"&gt;affect the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, allowing certain cancer-promoting microbes to take hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001j3b6nm0lfi7py@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are still in our infancy in understanding whether those are true risk factors, whether there is a link and actually how do they actually lead to cancer, in terms of these biological mechanisms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001l3b6n613u45f7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most cases of early-onset cancer are not explained by a heritable factor, but Ng said those diagnosed with any cancer at a young age have a higher chance of being diagnosed with a hereditary syndrome, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank"&gt;Lynch syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/familial-adenomatous-polyposis" target="_blank"&gt;familial adenomatous polyposis&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001m3b6n6aeyqr3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All young patients diagnosed with cancer should undergo familial genetic testing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001n3b6n4zsqbe94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also important to know your family history of cancer, Ng said. “If there is a family history, then an individual may be eligible for cancer screening, or eligible to start cancer screening at a younger age, and this could be life-saving,” she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001p3b6n56h02ekz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have been diagnosed with any cancer, being young has its advantages, Ng said. Younger patients tend to be healthier, for one. They are more likely to withstand higher doses and more cycles of chemotherapy compared with older patients, and they can undergo surgery and radiation more often as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001q3b6nzp913lcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nevertheless, Ng, said, “their survival   is not necessarily better than that of an older patient with cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001r3b6nad16lo7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She noted that for colorectal cancer, “the very youngest patients” — those younger than age 35 — “seem to have shorter survival.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001t3b6n2huyrhl8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ng  reiterated the importance of screening at the appropriate age for your level of risk: 45 if you are of average risk, and earlier if you have a family history.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001u3b6nyv3lag3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She also stressed how crucial it is to put embarrassment and stigma aside and to reach out to your doctor, and even a family member, if you are having unusual symptoms, like those mentioned above.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001v3b6ngk18h03k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s so important that we try to normalize these conversations,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001w3b6n33gdl0xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She added she also would like to see physicians routinely and systematically ask their patients two questions: “‘Are you having blood in the stool? Are you having a change in your bowel habits?’ so that these symptoms can come to light.” Especially because many people are reluctant to bring them up themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/span&gt;n January 2020, just weeks before the NBA shut down and Costco shelves emptied and Tom Hanks got sick, Joy Corbitt’s only brother died in his mid-forties with symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/covid/" id="auto-tag_covid" data-tag="covid"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;. Which meant, from the pandemic’s earliest days, Joy was taking no chances. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	She’d heard that Black and brown people like her seemed to be getting sick and dying at higher rates than other Americans. And that kids were either not getting sick, or getting less sick, or getting sick in ways we didn’t really understand. So, when it came to protecting her then-14-year-old daughter Lia, the North Carolina mother was vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I was consumed with the news — consumed with the numbers,” Joy says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As one week of lockdown slogged into the next, Lia, a straight-A student, struggled through that chaotic, ever unmuted, camera-off Zoom version of school. Which is to say, she didn’t learn much. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	With Joy’s husband James, a long-haul trucker, frequently on the road, the mother and daughter did their best to fill the time. They got a crazy Shih Tzu puppy named Zane. They spent long hours playing foosball and air hockey. They watched Netflix and cooking shows and &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; together (yes, even the sex scenes). 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	By the time fall 2020 poked its head onto the horizon, Lia’s high school was set to resume in-person classes. Joy kept her daughter home. She was anxious; it was too soon for students to return. But Lia, a budding theater kid, was eager to get back to her friends, to her life, to try her luck onstage. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	A couple months into the school year, after Lia scored a role in a production of &lt;em&gt;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&lt;/em&gt;, Joy relented. Lia “just lit up” about theater, her mom recalls. Joy figured, we had to let kids be kids. She took some consolation in the rules mandating universal masking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The masking, of course, didn’t last long. Kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On an otherwise unremarkable day in January 2021, Lia came home with what she described as a “very minor sore throat.” She isolated, per school policy, counting down the 10 days until she could return. On Lia’s first day back, though, her throat was sore all morning. She threw up at lunch. Joy took her home early.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I was very confused,” Lia says. “I thought, ‘Am I still sick?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I thought it would go away,” she adds, “quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Over the next three years, Lia would develop a perplexing, debilitating, and persistent set of symptoms. Extreme fatigue that turned mornings into catatonic nightmares. Brain fog that made memories slippery. Incessant vomiting. It all kept her out of class, stuck in the nurse’s office — or out of school entirely. The straight-A’s evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Lia’s story is one I’ve heard from dozens of families over two years investigating the impact of long Covid on kids. It’s a slow-moving spiral: first their health, then their grades, then their future. And as the country throttles past the pandemic’s fifth anniversary, those for whom Covid looms very present are feeling increasingly forgotten, subject to pervasive skepticism and a kind of cultural fatigue when it comes to their illness.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The Make America Healthy Again movement has recently gestured at embracing the long Covid community. In September, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened two roundtables with the stated purpose of bringing long Covid “out of the shadows,” including by launching a “public awareness and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/education/" id="auto-tag_education" data-tag="education"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; campaign.” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall — a physician with a loved one suffering from long Covid and who co-led the convenings — says those conversations were the first step to “take this invisible illness seriously.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But since the earliest days of the second Trump administration, the dollars that could help those suffering from the illness have quietly faded away. In March, cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) disappeared the nearly $2 billion invested in the &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;RECOVER (Researching Covid to Enhance Recovery) initiative&lt;/a&gt;, hamstringing research that might have yielded diagnostic tests or better treatments. The same week, the administration shuttered the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Long Covid Research and Practice. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gutted the NIH’s Vaccine Research Center — the entity whose work laid the foundation for the Moderna Covid shot. In May, health officials installed by Trump overrode career scientists at the Food and Drug Administration to limit approvals of new Covid vaccines. Around the same time, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disavowed the vaccine for healthy kids and pregnant women. (“We’re now one step closer to realizing President Trump’s promise to make America healthy again,” Kennedy said in a video announcing the policy.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the weeks that followed, the secretary also removed every member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with a merry band of loyalists and skeptics. That committee has since walked back recommendations for the Covid shot. And since the committee’s suggestions only move forward with the approval of the CDC director, RFK Jr. fired Susan Monarez, whom he’d appointed to that role 29 days earlier, for her refusal to “commit in advance to approving every [committee] recommendation regardless of the scientific evidence,” as Monarez later testified at a Senate hearing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Then there was Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill, expected to boot tens of millions of Americans, including potentially one in five kids, off Medicaid. Where health insurance goes, vaccine access follows: Uninsured or partially insured children are less likely to get the shot, studies show. And unvaccinated children are up to 20 times more likely to develop long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment on how the measures taken since March could impact young people with long Covid. But in the leadup to this school year, these developments led experts to warn that Covid cases may start ramping up again. That could have devastating effects in an education system beset by plummeting achievement levels and an epidemic of absenteeism (more than 10 million kids, or nearly one-third of all school-aged children, regularly missed school last year). And for families already affected by long Covid, absence after absence is prompting threats of investigations for truancy that have led to children being removed from school altogether, either by choice or upon the advice of the district. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Millions of Americans are impacted by long Covid, and they deserve a federal government that will have their back,” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said in response to inquiries from &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. “The Trump administration is not only failing to achieve those goals, but actively taking us in the wrong direction.” 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It all suggests a brewing public health crisis for a generation of Americans — including people like Lia Corbitt, who, since 2022, has been largely in virtual education. That’s left doting parents like Joy disheartened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“When you have a disability people can’t see, you don’t get the same level of empathy,” Joy says. “It feels like the world has moved on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	THE CDC DEFINES LONG COVID as a wide array of chronic symptoms — including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, memory changes, and sleep disturbances — that began after an infection with the virus and last more than three months. The most recent data from HHS estimated that, as of December 2024, around 22 million American adults had the illness at some point. More than nine million were still sick with it by the end of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Data is harder to come by for children, who since the earliest days of the pandemic were noted to experience a wider-ranging and less predictable set of symptoms than adults. In February 2024, a paper published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; (AAP) estimated that up to six million children in the United States had suffered from long Covid at some point. A year later, CDC researchers put the figure at closer to one million, with 300,000 actively suffering from the disease; it also noted the numbers, based on national survey data, may significantly undercount the illness’ true toll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Whichever figure you use, the numbers are enormous, rivaling conditions like ADHD and autism as one of the most common chronic diseases in American youth today. And for the children and teens I’ve spoken with, long Covid has done serious physical and emotional damage. It’s also hindered their ability to participate in school — something that becomes an all-encompassing source of frustration for children and parents alike. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	All of the students interviewed for this story were diagnosed with long Covid. And they all met the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/department-of-education/" id="auto-tag_department-of-education" data-tag="department-of-education"&gt;Department of Education&lt;/a&gt;’s (DOE) eligibility criteria for specialized school accommodations because of their illness. It’s a group that’s ballooned in size: The number of children receiving specialized accommodations increased by 500,000 after the pandemic relative to before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There’s Alexander, in eighth grade when the pandemic hit, the adventurer extraordinaire from Massachusetts whose Covid-related exhaustion meant tardy after tardy — but who was denied accommodations because his grades were too good. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There’s Eliza, a kindergartner in Washington state whose severe stomach pain constantly kept her out of school, but who was denied accommodations because the principal said that “we have great teachers here.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There’s ninth-grader William, a Mets fanatic from suburban New York, who was denied accommodations because school officials told him that “Covid is over.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Those struggles are despite a July 2021 joint statement from HHS and the Department of Justice clarifying that long Covid is a protected condition under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But early actions under the second Trump administration stand to further jeopardize their ability to access special education. An Inauguration Day executive order targeting DEI withdrew federal support through the DOE for learning loss caused by the pandemic, including from long Covid. (The rollbacks specifically targeted special education for Hispanic, Black, and Tribal communities, whose children who faced higher rates of severe illness due to Covid, and who use special education at higher rates.) The Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts likewise stand to dry up billions more in special education dollars. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	And should the Trump White House fulfill its campaign promises to axe the DOE entirely, billions of federal dollars upon which schools rely to support millions of children who need special education may vanish overnight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, the legitimacy of long Covid has been a wellspring of controversy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	What the wide-ranging long Covid symptoms have in common is that they’re a challenging combination of persistent yet intermittent, incapacitating yet invisible. Too often, especially for young people, that means adults — even doctors — “don’t believe there’s anything wrong with the child,” says Alexandra Yonts, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who is also the director of the post-Covid program at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. “They think they’re being a teenager.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="pullquote larva // a-blockquote-type-pullquote lrv-u-color-black u-border-tb-2 lrv-u-margin-lr-00 lrv-u-text-align-center u-padding-lr-150@tablet lrv-u-padding-tb-150@mobile-max lrv-u-padding-tb-2 u-margin-tb-250@tablet lrv-u-margin-tb-2@mobile-max u-font-weight-900 u-font-family-theme-primary lrv-u-font-size-38@tablet lrv-u-font-size-32 u-line-height-30 u-line-height-36@tablet   "&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I’m battling with the school because they don’t believe anything is wrong with Dakota. They don’t believe he has long Covid. They don’t believe long Covid exists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Michelle Hooker, Dakota Presnell’s mother&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	At various points, skeptical doctors have attributed the symptoms to a kind of neurosis: patient as hypochondriac, equipped with a fancy new diagnosis. “It is hard to know if this kind of long-tail phenomenon is more pronounced or more common [with Covid],” Adam Lauring, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Michigan, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/11/coronavirus-chronic/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; in June of 2020, “or we are just seeing things that come to our attention because there is a heightened awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Other doctors have chalked up the symptoms to a kind of societal malaise: patient as emotional sponge in a chaotic world, sickness quite literally all in their heads. “Whether long Covid can be considered just a consequence of a viral infection or should be attributed to the implications of ‘the pandemic era’ we are now living in is still a matter of debate,” Achille Marino and Rolando Cimaz, pediatric rheumatologists at the University of Milan, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2022/01000/long_coronavirus_disease_in_pediatric_rheumatology.30.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 in the journal of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Some in the medical community have even called for dumping the diagnosis altogether. “It is time to stop using terms like ‘Long Covid,’” John Gerrard, former chief health officer of Queensland, Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1037611" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a press release for a March 2024 study comparing symptoms of Covid patients to those with the flu. “This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Another piece of the long Covid puzzle is a practical issue: getting diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to Elizabeth Pray, former president of Washington state’s chapter of the National Association of School Nurses, who herself has cared for numerous kids with symptoms of long Covid, there are two major steps in the diagnostic odyssey. First, the child needs a documented Covid infection. Second, they need to find a doctor able — and willing — to make the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But many kids may not have tested at the time of their infection, Pray says. Months into the pandemic, the U.S. faced severe shortages in Covid tests for everyone. Well into the winter of 2022, major retailers like CVS and Walgreens were still rationing tests to favor adults, who were at greater risk of severe illness and death. At various points, tests were restricted for kids under 16 years of age, and then under 12. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Even in kids who did test, studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00115-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;up to 90 percent of cases can go missed&lt;/a&gt; due to differences in how kids’ immune systems handle the virus. “If you have families that didn’t test,” Pray says, “how would you tie it back to know how big the problem is?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the situation where a child does have a confirmed case, finding a doctor to ink the long Covid diagnosis can still be a challenge. According to the patient advocacy group Long Covid Alliance, there are fewer than a dozen long-Covid pediatric clinics across the country, compared with 400 adult clinics. That means many kids who live far from major medical centers — like Pray’s students in Moses Lake, a town of 25,000 that’s 200 miles from Seattle — won’t ever be seen at such a clinic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Dakota Presnell was one of those kids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Before the blackouts, the vertigo, the sniffle and the cough, Dakota’s childhood in the seaside North Carolina vacation town of Manteo was idyllic. 

	&lt;/p&gt;

He used to spend the summers roller skating and playing in the ocean, his mom says, before his long-Covid symptoms hit.&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	He’d spend summers leaping off story-high footbridges and docks and jetties, and slipping down slides into the rollicking Atlantic surrounding Roanoke Island. In the off-season, he’d roller skate down deserted streets and frequent the laser tag arena or the bowling alley, playing one or the other until they closed up shop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Dakota was “a happy-go-lucky kid,” his mother, Michelle Hooker, says. “It was hard to keep him home… He was always on the go, always doing something.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Then, sixth grade. Winter, 2021. Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Dakota had gone back to school in-person and — like many who contracted Covid’s most infectious variant — he was quickly bedridden, Michelle says. Of all his symptoms, the dizziness and fatigue were the worst. At one point, a friend told Michelle that she should “look into” long Covid; she’d bring it up time and time again with Dakota’s pediatrician, to little avail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the summer of 2022, the blackouts started. Out of nowhere, like a limp marionette, Dakota would drop to the ground. Michelle “became his legs,” she says, as she’d carry her son from room to room. By the fall his fatigue and fainting spells were a “complete and utter nightmare.” By January 2024, Dakota’s symptoms also included memory loss and severe pain in his arms and legs that he couldn’t shake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Michelle says that, during this time, they went to loads of doctors — pediatricians, neurologists, the works — and racked up several hospitalizations where they were seen by still more clinical teams. They accrued loads of diagnoses: non-epileptic seizures, amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome, functional neurologic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That last diagnosis, in particular, irked Michelle. “That’s a fancy way of saying it’s all in your head,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Long Covid, she adds, never made the list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Yonts, at Children’s National, experiences like Dakota’s are no longer surprising. She’s heard story after story of undiagnosed patients who, by the time they make it to her clinic, have been seen by doctors who “think there’s something else going on, [something] not physical.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	At the same time, Yonts knows specialized long Covid clinics, including hers, can’t see the vast majority of patients who request a visit: Their capacity is “woefully inadequate,” she says. “We’ve had really lengthy waitlists for most of our existence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	FOR KIDS LIKE DAKOTA suffering from long Covid, navigating school is a mess, too. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Under &lt;a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/504faq.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;federal law&lt;/a&gt;, any student with a “physical or mental impairment” impacting their ability to participate in school is entitled to accommodations under a so-called 504 or an Individualized Education (IEP) plan. The DOE’s language is deliberately inclusive: Such entitlements stand whether students are diagnosed with — or are “regarded to have” — any such impairment, William Koski, director of the Youth and Education Law Project at Stanford University, says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="post-content-image //  "&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The accommodations provided under the plans can run a broad spectrum. They include everything from rest breaks to extra time to provision of quiet spaces for testing. They can also be more tailored: For example, for children with conditions that put them at risk of passing out — in which staying hydrated is critical — accommodations can include things like keeping pretzels or a water bottle at their desk. More intensive plans can include tutors or &lt;a href="https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/student-engagement/tools-tips/differences-between-504-plan-and-individualized-education-program-iep" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;“changes to the curricular expectations”&lt;/a&gt; altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Since the onset of the pandemic, the number of school-aged students with IEPs has jumped. In the 2018-2019 school year, 6.3 million children received special education services. In 2022-2023, 6.8 million did. Still, some long-Covid families say they’ve been in the dark when it comes to accommodations. In some cases, they’ve faced pushback for seeking special education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That’s true for people like Lia, who had a pre-existing special education plan for ADHD, and who had, by then, a long Covid diagnosis. But Lia struggled to convince her school to provide additional accommodations for her fatigue, nausea, and frequent absences. After much back and forth, the school offered a compromise: She could have two extra days to hand in her homework. Oh, and she could go to the bathroom when she needed to. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“That was really the only change that they gave us,” Lia says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“If there had been other options,” Joy adds, “they weren’t discussed or offered.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The obstacles to accommodations have been especially stark for people like Michelle and Dakota, who hadn’t previously navigated special education, and who lacked a formal diagnosis of long Covid. It took more than three years before Michelle realized they could even seek help. “[The school] didn’t give us any information,” Dakota says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	When they finally did hear through Facebook about the possibility of a 504 — and started pinging the school to advocate — things quickly became contentious.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I’m battling the school,” Michelle says, “[because] they don’t believe anything is wrong with Dakota.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	(Dare County Schools, Dakota’s district, did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Laura Malone, pediatrician and director of the Post-Covid-19 Rehabilitation Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, part of the trouble around accommodations traces back to lack of knowledge around the illness. “Long Covid is a newer diagnosis…[that] schools, education systems aren’t as aware of,” Malone says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Michelle puts it more bluntly. “They don’t believe he has long Covid,” she says of the school. “They don’t believe long Covid exists.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	AFTER MONTHS OF BATTLING, by the beginning of eighth grade in fall 2023, Dakota successfully got a 504 plan. Theoretically, that entitled him to extra time on tests and deadlines, as well as breaks throughout the school day. On paper, it was a version of school that retained a sense of normalcy while being feasible given his fatigue and brain fog. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Unfortunately, the text on paper didn’t translate to real life, Michelle says. The plan “didn’t do much — he was still expected to [take] all these classes, carry all of this homework, do the daily assignments,” she says. “It was kind of a B.S., fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type answer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In this way, Dakota and Michelle’s experience reflects a different issue with learning accommodations: the difficulty implementing and enforcing them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	One of the biggest pieces of the implementation issue is that of dogma, Kathy Riley, nurse at the Plymouth school district in Massachusetts and co-lead for the National Association of School Nurses’ long Covid efforts, says. There are cases where teachers, much like some school officials, simply disagree with the notion that long Covid is real, or that kids with it need help. “The teachers have to buy into the accommodations…or it’s not going to work,” Riley says. “If a teacher doesn’t really agree with it, then the kid doesn’t get it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That gets into the problem of enforcement, which typically falls upon the districts themselves. The DOE’s Office of Civil Rights “generally will not evaluate the content” of 504s or IEPs, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/civil-rights-laws/disability-discrimination/frequently-asked-questions-section-504-fape" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; on its website. Nor does it “review the result of individual placement or other educational decisions.” Instead, “any disagreement can be resolved through a due process hearing.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But a &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; from the Government Accountability Office found that the ability and willingness of families to pursue such hearings varies widely due to language barriers, ability to find an attorney, legal costs, and fears of retaliation, among other factors. Such barriers were particularly marked in low-income school districts, which on average have more children of color, and which tend to have higher numbers of children with disabilities. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="pullquote larva // a-blockquote-type-pullquote lrv-u-color-black u-border-tb-2 lrv-u-margin-lr-00 lrv-u-text-align-center u-padding-lr-150@tablet lrv-u-padding-tb-150@mobile-max lrv-u-padding-tb-2 u-margin-tb-250@tablet lrv-u-margin-tb-2@mobile-max u-font-weight-900 u-font-family-theme-primary lrv-u-font-size-38@tablet lrv-u-font-size-32 u-line-height-30 u-line-height-36@tablet   "&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;At various points, skeptical doctors have attributed the symptoms to a kind of neurosis: patient as hypochondriac, equipped with a fancy new diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Many parents feel they are at a disadvantage in a conflict with the school district due to an imbalance of power and so may be reluctant to engage in dispute resolution,” the report concluded. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; about the inability of students with long Covid to receive 504s or IEPs, or lack of enforcement of 504s or IEPs in cases where they are granted. )&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Recent reporting suggests that kids’ access to special education may worsen further following widespread cuts to the DOE. In March, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-education-department-civil-rights.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;hollowed out&lt;/a&gt; the department’s Office of Civil Rights — including entire investigative teams in the majority of regions — leaving thousands of pending cases in limbo, according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. And in May, &lt;em&gt;ProPu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;blica&lt;/em&gt; found that, in the period following the cuts, hundreds fewer ongoing cases &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-civil-rights-donald-trump-discrimination" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;were investigated&lt;/a&gt;, and new cases were dismissed outright at rates 30 percent higher than previously. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In late September, Maryland Sen. Angela Alsobrooks introduced a bill to exempt funding for special education from any future DOE cuts. “Any attempt to slash programs and protections for our students with disabilities is beyond callous,” Alsobrooks said in a press release. Still, by October — amid the government shutdown — mass layoffs were &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-education-staff-decimated-after-trump-administration-shutdown/story?id=126432474" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;imperiling the DOE’s ability&lt;/a&gt; to administer special education, department sources told &lt;em&gt;ABC News&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Dakota, politics shouldn’t play a role in whether kids with long Covid get the support they need. That’s true for teachers not following certain special education plans rather than others. It’s also true for government-wide initiatives that pull out the rug from under children like him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“People are inclined to their opinion,” Dakota says, “but at the same time, in some situations, like [with] long Covid…opinions get in the way.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	THE TUG-OF-WAR AROUND accommodations comes at a time when fewer American students are attending school than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In January 2024, a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; found that chronic absenteeism — defined as the number of students missing at least one out of every 10 school days — &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312249121" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;nearly doubled&lt;/a&gt; following the Covid pandemic. Every state saw increases in chronic absenteeism, the study found: In total, nearly 30 percent — some 13 million children — regularly missed school.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The alarm bells around the absenteeism crisis partly relate to learning loss. In January 2025, an annual Congressional analysis known as the “nation’s report card” found that American students’ achievement levels were declining to some of the &lt;a href="https://www.nagb.gov/news-and-events/news-releases/2025/nations-report-card-decline-in-reading-progress-in-math.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;worst in recent history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The alarm is also related to money. Attendance is one of the key factors that determines school funding in most states. That incentivizes schools to do what they can to make sure students show up, since absences can only hurt their bottom line. As a result, some districts are taking a punitive approach to chronic absenteeism. On one extreme is Missouri, where, following an August 2023 decision from the state’s Supreme Court, parents of children with poor attendance records &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-school-absences-tardy-attendance-fa2372189ee7cb55e59aa35165d9691c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;are now liable&lt;/a&gt; for jail time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	A more common mechanism involves truancy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	States like Indiana are &lt;a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/03/08/i-cant-teach-a-kid-thats-not-there-indiana-lawmakers-give-final-approval-to-absenteeism-bill/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;already moving to toughen truancy laws&lt;/a&gt; by introducing bills to tighten attendance requirements and immediately refer families for investigation in ways that can lead to prosecution of children, parents, or both. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Truancy hinges on defining an absence as unexcused. But that’s a definition “really dependent on the school itself,” Christy McGill, deputy superintendent for educator effectiveness and family engagement for the Nevada Department of Education, says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For example, some schools may require doctors’ notes for every missed day, McGill says, while others do not. Studies have found that children of color were &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23328584211003132" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;up to four times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have their absences marked unexcused than those who were white.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; contacted every state’s education department for this article, the majority of which did not respond to requests for comment. Most of those that did — Colorado, Kentucky, Oregon, and Utah among them — lack visibility into the reasons for excused versus unexcused absences. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Such variability worries Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a national nonprofit organization focused on chronic absenteeism. “Unfortunately, across the United States, absences are too often deemed ‘unexcused’ for arbitrary reasons,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The lack of clarity around excused versus unexcused absences includes those potentially related to medical conditions such as long Covid. Even as large-scale reviews of children with long Covid find &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9476461/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;absenteeism to be a consistent issue&lt;/a&gt;, schools have little insight into whether poor attendance in their district may derive, in part, from kids struggling with the condition. “There’s no question there could be long Covid symptoms out there we don’t know about,” Eric Mackey, Alabama’s state superintendent of education, says, “[but] I don’t have any information on that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	(The DOE did not respond to inquiries from &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; about policies for determining unexcused absences or the initiation of truancy investigations. The agency also did not respond to inquiries about how schools should incorporate protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act into their policies around absences or truancy.)

	&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been beat up and chewed up, and it’s not fair, because Dakota’s falling through the cracks. His light is getting dimmer and dimmer — because he’s losing hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Michelle Hooker&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Many of the families I spoke to, at one point or another, found themselves staring down threats of truancy. For some, those threats came via robocall after robocall. For Dakota and Michelle, they came in meetings with school officials. And for Lia and Joy, they came more insidiously. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I always wondered what my teachers thought,” Lia says. “They knew I was sick — but did they believe me, [or] did they think I was making it up?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	So, when Lia’s medical waiver fell off seemingly overnight in the fall of 2022, Joy was concerned. If Lia missed 10 days of a given course, she’d automatically fail — if not worse, when it came to the specter of truancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	(Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Lia’s district, did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“I tried to communicate from the beginning that…there is no way, at this point, she is not going to miss more,” Joy says. “[But] it didn’t matter. It felt like she was being punished for being ill.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	AFTER MONTHS OF FRUITLESS morning wake-ups and early afternoon pickups, tardies and absences and missed assignments, months of blackouts and vomiting and forgetfulness and dozing off, Dakota and Lia were left with only one option: hybrid education. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Education outside the schoolyard has long been considered the option of last resort, Koski, at Stanford, says: Keeping kids with their peers “is one of the bedrock principles of …the disability rights movement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Based on how their accommodations were implemented, though, the families I interviewed say they felt trapped. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In Lia’s case, even as her 504 entitled her to two extra days to submit homework, she kept racking up absences for not bringing it to class on the original due date. And even as she and Joy heard through the grapevine that other students across the country struggling with long Covid were offered additional services, such IEPs that included hybrid school with teachers coming to their homes for in-person tutoring, she was never offered such a plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Given how the school was handling [accommodations], and their procedures, and their rules, I really had no choice but to switch to virtual school,” Lia says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That switch came with its own costs. She was always missing out: parties, prom, homecomings. She kept finding herself on the outside of inside jokes. She lost close friends, who accused her of being flaky, or avoiding them entirely. “It’s still affecting me to this day,” Lia says.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Dakota found himself in a similar spot when, this past summer — after Michelle finally had an opportunity to advocate for his special education plan — officials rendered a decision: Dakota would be enrolled at Dare Learning Academy, the district’s “alternative” educational option. It was the worst of both worlds: simultaneously denying Dakota additional accommodations and punting him further to the margins. It also felt like confirmation of what his family had dreaded: that school officials saw him as undisciplined or unmotivated rather than sick. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Michelle and Dakota, the decision felt premeditated: People “sometimes have their minds made up before we even see them,” Dakota says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s hard to know whether the experiences of kids like Lia and Dakota are becoming more common. The most recent data available from the DOE shows that the number of students in homebound or hospital-bound, residential facility, or separate school-based programs has stayed roughly stable since the pandemic. But that data doesn’t account for the kind of hybrid education that became mainstream during the pandemic. (The DOE did not comment on inquiries from &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/em&gt;about how students in hybrid school settings are counted.)  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The longer-term consequences on a generation of struggling children taught without adequate support — or via hybrid education — are also not yet clear, says Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. But, based on what she’s seen, she’s afraid that “every community is going to pay the price in the long run.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“We absolutely know the best place for a kid is in school,” Kressly says. In virtual education, she adds, “are we just putting them out of sight?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Some parents — like Michelle — are already observing changes in their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“We’ve been beat up and chewed up, no one’s taken account for what they’ve done, and it’s not fair, because he’s falling through the cracks,” she says of Dakota. “As long as this goes on,” she adds, “his light is getting dimmer and dimmer — because he’s losing hope.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Dakota, for his part, still has big dreams. He wants to live in a big city (Norfolk, Virginia), and work a demanding job (general surgeon). Dakota thinks he’ll be good, too: “I know how to listen and take other people’s opinions and worries into account,” he says.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But Dakota also knows he faces long odds. And he knows how much his illness plays a role in that. “Long Covid has taken my life and turned it around,” Dakota says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Lia is also trying to concentrate on the future. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	After she got into a pediatric long Covid clinic and began implementing a variety of different treatments — salt tabs day and night, electrolyte powder infused in every drink, this and that medication prescribed off-label — slowly but surely, she has been feeling better. So, she’s got her eyes on the prize. A high school diploma. A college welcome weekend. Most recently, a beauty pageant title. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Even still, life looks different now. In particular, there’s a void where her friends and classmates used to be. “I’m back,” Lia says, “and at the same time, so much has changed, because I’ve missed out on so much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	This fall, she was excited to make a fresh start at college. New place, new people, new her. A her that feels like the real her. Not the long Covid version. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	College “is a place where no one really knows me,” Lia says. “I can start over — and kind of, maybe, separate myself from the illness a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;

Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia. Dr Stephen Cabral, a Neuropathy expert and host of The Cabral Concept podcast, shared one particular sign that could suggest dementia. He also highlighted another symptom to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;The video was titled: "The earliest sign of Alzheimer's and Dementia is getting lost more easily...

The research suggests that these shape changes are closely tied to age-related cognitive decline and may offer a new way to detect dementia risk before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research on brain aging has emphasized the loss of volume in specific regions, like the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. These studies have revealed that certain brain areas are more vulnerable to aging than others, showing pronounced shrinkage as people get older. However, the brain is not made up of isolated parts. Its regions are connected and interact in complex ways. The new study focused on these broader patterns, aiming to understand how aging affects the geometry of the entire brain rather than just the size of individual pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was motivated by growing evidence that the brain’s shape affects how it functions. Studies have shown that the brain’s physical structure can place constraints on how different regions communicate. Subtle shifts in position, shape, or spacing between regions might disrupt the brain’s internal coordination. Despite this possibility, previous methods typically did not examine the geometry of the brain’s spatial layout. This study set out to fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s well known that the brain changes as we age, but most research has focused on individual regions, like the hippocampus, that are known to shrink over time,” said study author &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nielsjanssen/" target="_blank"&gt;Niels Janssen&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychology at Universidad de La Laguna in Spain. “In our study, we looked instead at how aging affects the shape of the whole brain. We found that the brain doesn’t just get smaller—it sags, almost as if it’s slowly settling under its own weight. The lower parts of the hemispheres spread outward, while the upper parts draw together, producing a gentle downward slouch in the brain’s overall shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed more than 2,600 brain scans from adults between the ages of 30 and 97. The research team analyzed 2,603 brain scans from adults between the ages of 30 and 97. These scans came from two large and independent datasets: the primary analysis used 2,039 scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies, and the findings were then confirmed in a separate set of 564 scans from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience. All participants had undergone high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, allowing the researchers to observe fine-grained structural features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure changes in the brain’s shape, the team used a method that calculates the distance between points on the brain’s surface and across matching regions in the left and right hemispheres. For example, they assessed how far apart the left and right hippocampus were, and whether that distance changed with age. This approach allowed the researchers to identify patterns of “expansion,” where regions appeared to move farther apart, and “compression,” where they shifted closer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a consistent pattern across the samples. As people aged, the lower front parts of the brain tended to move outward, creating a subtle bulging effect. At the same time, the upper back parts of the brain drew inward. This produced a sloping or sagging effect, almost like the brain was slowly settling downward. These patterns became more pronounced with increasing age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at overall shape, the study examined how the distances between paired brain regions across hemispheres changed over time. Many of these distances, especially between temporal and subcortical areas, increased with age. These shifts were not merely byproducts of brain shrinkage. Even after accounting for changes in volume, the spatial shifts remained significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also linked these shape changes to cognitive performance. Participants who performed worse on memory and executive function tests tended to show more extreme patterns of expansion and compression. For example, individuals with poorer memory showed greater separation between parts of the temporal lobe and more compression in parietal regions. These associations were found even after accounting for age, suggesting that shape changes might track with cognitive function more closely than age alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how the brain ages is a complex challenge that requires looking at it from many angles,” Janssen told PsyPost. “Most studies focus on the microscopic level—on molecules and cells—but our findings show that the shape of the brain itself also changes in meaningful ways. Viewing the brain at this larger scale may provide new insights into the mechanisms of healthy aging and the changes that occur in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are consistent and supported by two independent datasets, there are several limitations. One is that most of the data came from cross-sectional samples, meaning different people were compared at different ages. This makes it difficult to track how an individual’s brain changes over time. The study did include a smaller group of participants scanned more than once, and their results supported the larger trends. Still, more long-term studies are needed to confirm these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the method used in the study measures distances between points in space, but not the biological mechanisms driving these changes. For example, it remains unclear whether the observed expansion and compression are due to changes in tissue composition, fluid balance, or other factors such as gravity and head positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may investigate whether mechanical stress, such as gradual downward shifting of the brain, contributes to age-related damage. This could open new pathways for understanding how structural changes lead to functional decline. It may also be possible to develop early warning systems based on the shape of the brain, identifying those most at risk for cognitive impairment before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study presents a new way of thinking about brain aging. It suggests that how the brain is shaped may matter just as much as how much brain tissue is lost. Subtle shifts in geometry may affect how different parts of the brain communicate and how efficiently they work together. Some regions, like the entorhinal cortex, sit close to hard structures like the base of the skull and might be particularly vulnerable to pressure from surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could help explain why the entorhinal cortex is ground zero of Alzheimer’s pathology,” said study co-author Michael Yassa, the director of the University of California, Irvine’s Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and James L. McGaugh Endowed Chair. “If the aging brain is gradually shifting in a way that squeezes this fragile region against a rigid boundary, it may create the perfect storm for damage to take root. Understanding that process gives us a whole new way to think about the mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease and the possibility of early detection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re just beginning to unlock how brain geometry shapes disease. But this research shows that the answers may be hiding in plain sight – in the shape of the brain itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63628-3" target="_blank"&gt;Age-related constraints on the spatial geometry of the brain&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yuritza Y.

Speaking through his YouTube channel, Dr. Kumar explained that two types of medicines — metformin and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) — can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb vitamin B12, potentially leading to deficiency over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metformin and Its Impact on B12 Absorption&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar highlighted that metformin, a widely used drug for managing diabetes and also prescribed in cases of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and metabolic disorders, is one of the key culprits. He explained that metformin can reduce vitamin B12 absorption in the small intestine. This interference, if prolonged, can result in a gradual decrease in B12 levels in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124531947" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124531947"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advised that individuals who are on long-term metformin therapy should remain aware of possible signs of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/vitamin-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin deficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. These may include fatigue, numbness, tingling sensations, or even cognitive changes such as forgetfulness and mood disturbances. Regular testing of B12 levels is recommended at least once every one to two years, especially for those taking the drug for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PPIs and the Role of Stomach Acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second class of drugs Dr. Kumar referred to are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), commonly prescribed for acidity and peptic ulcers. Medications such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole are widely used for gastric conditions. Dr. Kumar explained that while PPIs are effective in reducing stomach acid, this decrease in gastric acid secretion affects how vitamin B12 is released from food, resulting in lower absorption levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that individuals who depend on these medications for chronic acidity or digestive issues could unknowingly become deficient in B12. This is because the stomach acid required to extract B12 from dietary sources becomes significantly reduced during long-term use of PPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-grx-impression="Article Recommendations - Edit#articleshow_inline_impression#magazines/panache/apollo-doctor-warns-two-common-medicines-that-affect-vitamin-b12-absorption-in-the-body | " class="ar_wrp arwd_ld_chk font_mon clr hide custom_ad"&gt;&lt;div class="ar_survey hide"&gt;&lt;p class="ar_back_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="arb_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="ar_lt_arr"&gt;«&lt;/span&gt; Back to recommendation stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124531947" id="div-vdoai-mid-124531947"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar emphasised that those taking metformin or PPIs should not stop their medication without consulting a doctor. Instead, he recommended regular monitoring of B12 levels and prompt testing if symptoms of deficiency appear. Early detection, he added, allows for easy correction through supplementation or dietary adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;p class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 09:30:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“死亡折叠”蛋白质可以使细胞自我毁灭。科学家想要控制它们：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/16/nx-s1-5575582/death-fold-proteins-apoptosis-alzheimers-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's, brain cells die too soon. In cancer, dangerous cells don't die soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because both diseases alter the way cells decide when to end their lives, a process called programmed cell death.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Cell death sounds morbid, but it's essential for our health," says &lt;a href="https://www.stjude.org/people/g/douglas-green.html" target="_blank"&gt;Douglas Green&lt;/a&gt;, who has spent decades studying the process at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, coaxing nerve cells to live longer could help people with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), he says, while getting tumor cells to die sooner could help people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So researchers have been searching for disease treatments that "modify or modulate the tendency of a cell to die," Green says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of these researchers is &lt;a href="https://www.stowers.org/people/randal-halfmann" target="_blank"&gt;Randal Halfmann&lt;/a&gt; at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He has been studying immune cells that self-destruct when they come into contact with molecules that present a threat to the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They have to somehow recognize that [threat] in this vast array of other complex molecules," he says, "and then within minutes, kill themselves."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They do this much the way a soldier might dive on a grenade to save others' lives.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Halfmann's team has been focusing on special proteins inside cells that can trigger this process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When these proteins recognize molecules associated with a virus or some other pathogen, he says, "they implode."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The proteins crumple and begin linking up with other crumpled proteins to form a structure called a "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPiuq7zqCyI" target="_blank"&gt;death fold&lt;/a&gt;" polymer. That starts a chain reaction of polymerization that ultimately kills the cell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Halfmann's team knew this process takes a burst of energy. But they couldn't locate the source.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Then they thought about a &lt;a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/question290.htm" target="_blank"&gt;process found in reusable hand warmers&lt;/a&gt; — which produce heat by changing from a liquid to a crystallized solid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Users start the chain reaction by flexing a metal disk inside the warmer. The mechanical disturbance causes the formation of a few tiny crystals, which quickly grow into much larger crystals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That releases all this energy," Halfmann says. "That's exactly what we envisioned was happening for these proteins."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His team provides &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/107962" target="_blank"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; supporting this explanation in the journal &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Halfmann found it a bit unsettling to think that so many cells carry these self-destruct buttons just waiting to be pushed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It just seemed like a really terrible way to live," he says, "every moment of a cell's life, to be at risk of spontaneously dying."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, death is what you want for a cancerous cell or one that's infected with a virus. But Halfmann suspects this hair-trigger system is needlessly killing brain cells in diseases like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that one hallmark of Alzheimer's is a misfolded protein called amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That amyloid, for reasons we don't really understand, ends up killing the neurons," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That could be because misfolded amyloid proteins, much like death fold proteins, seem to replicate and form crystal-like structures.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Halfmann has begun looking for ways to keep brain cells alive by making it harder for those crystals to form. He's hoping to use an approach that's a bit like adding antifreeze to water to keep it from freezing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Biotech firms are also trying to halt the process, but at a different point — by interrupting various communication pathways involved in cell death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several companies are "working furiously" to block one pathway in particular, Green says. It's a pathway that involves some of the same death fold proteins Halfmann's lab has been studying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pathway leads to inflammation as well as the death of neurons in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biotech companies are betting on products known as antisense drugs, which can prevent a cell from making specific proteins, including death fold proteins, Green says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If they're right, he says, these efforts are "going to cure a lot of diseases that we associate with aging and inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They'll do this, in part, by changing how cells make life-or-death decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The CDC data was analyzed by the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The group’s analysis follows a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/how-common-is-obesity-us-5663c0388b19009eae3834d695710bc4"&gt;CDC report last year&lt;/a&gt; that found that the overall rate of obesity in the U.S. is high but holding steady, affecting about 40% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While the decline is positive, “it's too soon to call it a trend,” said Dr. J. Nadine Gracia, president and chief executive for TFAH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And with recent federal funding cuts, staff layoffs and eliminated programs, “this potential progress is also at risk,” Gracia said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman said in an email that the administration is “encouraged by the new data showing progress in the fight against obesity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We are restructuring public health programs to eliminate waste, reduce bureaucracy, and redirect resources toward real prevention,” said spokesman Andrew Nixon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The latest report analyzed data from the CDC's 2024 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which uses annual telephone surveys to collect data on health behaviors and chronic conditions in U.S. states and territories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It showed that 19 states had obesity rates among adults of 35% or higher, 22 states had rates between 30% and 35% and nine states had obesity rates of below 30%. The rates varied from a low of 25% in Colorado to a high of more than 40% in West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Between 2023 and 2024, no state had statistically significant increases or decreases in their obesity rates, after 18 states saw significant increases in the previous five years, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Before 2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%, By 2019, a dozen states had rates that high — and the number continued to climb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In adults, obesity is defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher. Body mass index is a calculation based on height and weight. Obesity is a chronic disease linked to a host of serious health problems including diabetes, stroke, cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's not clear exactly what may be driving the apparent improvements in obesity. Wider use of drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound — which target appetite and slow digestion — could be starting to show up in reported data, said Aviva Musicus, a science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. Increased support for nutrition assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic might also be a factor, she suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also details a broad range of federal, state and local efforts that focus on improving nutrition and boosting physical activity, said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health expert who specializes in obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I think the report would argue that some of these interventions may actually be successful,” said Cunningham, who was not involved with the research. “That would suggest that there are possibly ways in which we could prevent obesity at the population level, which would be a really, really big deal.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Warmer temperatures throughout the year mean that ticks  — particularly black-legged (or deer) ticks —  are active for a longer period. This makes it more likely that a person will contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With warmer temperatures, ticks can also survive winters farther north and at higher elevations. They can expand into regions that were once too cold for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rising temperatures and destructive deforestation impact the habitats of tick-carrying animals, like deer and mice, pushing them closer to humans. Together, these changes create more opportunities for ticks to spread — and for people to come into contact with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about this rise in Lyme cases?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ohio County officials told &lt;a href="https://wtov9.com/news/local/ohio-county-faces-endemic-levels-of-lyme-disease-with-nearly-300-cases-reported-lyme-disease-ohio-county-tick-borne-illnesses-endemic-levels-health-department-howard-gamble-cases-reported-environmental-conditions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WTOV 9;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;WTOV 9&lt;/a&gt; that early detection and treatment remain critical in the treatment of Lyme. Delays can lead to severe complications affecting the heart and nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To prevent contracting Lyme, it's important to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid tick bites;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid tick bites&lt;/a&gt;.

Pull the insect upward to remove — but don't twist! This can break the mouthparts off and leave them embedded, which is ripe for infection. After fully removing the tick, clean the site with rubbing alcohol, iodine, or soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the days following, watch for a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs-symptoms/lyme-disease-rashes.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bull's-eye rash;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;bull's-eye rash&lt;/a&gt; and flu-like symptoms.

			&lt;p&gt;After a decade of work, researchers are closer than ever to a key breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-test-predicts-whether-organ-transplants-will-be-rejected"&gt;kidney organ transplants&lt;/a&gt;: being able to transfer kidneys from donors with different blood types than the recipients, which could significantly speed up waiting times and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from institutions across Canada and China has managed to create a 'universal' kidney, which can, in theory, be accepted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"&gt;by any patient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their test organ survived and functioned for several days in the body of a brain-dead recipient, whose family consented to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've seen this play out in a human model," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/10/universal-organ-transplant/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Stephen Withers, from the University of British Columbia in Canada. "It gives us invaluable insight into how to improve long-term outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surgeons-resuscitate-dead-heart-in-life-saving-organ-transplant-to-baby"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgeons Resuscitate 'Dead' Heart in Life-Saving Organ Transplant to Baby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it stands today, people with type O blood who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/medical-breakthrough-enables-organ-transplants-without-immunosuppression-drugs"&gt;need a kidney&lt;/a&gt; usually have to wait for a type O kidney to become available from a donor. That accounts for more than half the people on waitlists, but because type O kidneys can function in people with other blood types, they're in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177480" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Blood Type Details" class="size-full wp-image-177480" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177480" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="176890" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in our blood plasma detect when a foreign antigen marker is present (&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/ABO_blood_type.svg"&gt;InvictaHOG/Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is currently possible to transplant kidneys of different &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"&gt;blood types&lt;/a&gt;, by training the recipient's body not to reject the organ, the existing process is far from perfect and not particularly practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's time-consuming, expensive, and risky, and it also requires living donors to work, as the recipient needs time to be prepped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the researchers effectively converted a type A kidney into a type O kidney, using special, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-019-0469-7"&gt;previously identified&lt;/a&gt; enzymes that strip away the sugar molecules (antigens) acting as markers of type A blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176893" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176893" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TransplantIllustration.jpg" alt="Kidney transplant illustration" class="wp-image-176893 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TransplantIllustration.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/TransplantIllustration-600x241.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176893" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers produced an enzyme-converted type-O (ECO) kidney ready for transplant. (Zeng et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Biomed.

"Once that's done, the immune system no longer sees the organ as foreign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There remain plenty of challenges ahead before trials in living humans can be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transplanted kidney did start to show signs of type A blood again by the third day, which led to an immune response – but the response was less severe than would usually be expected, and there were signs that the body was trying to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-era-in-surgery-has-patients-stay-awake-during-kidney-transplants"&gt;tolerate the kidney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177073" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The statistics surrounding this issue are pretty stark: at the moment, 11 people die waiting for a kidney transplant each day, &lt;a href="https://unos.org/news/90000-people-are-waiting-for-a-kidney-heres-one-way-to-get-them-a-kidney-faster/"&gt;in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of those are waiting for type O kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a problem that scientists are tackling from multiple angles, including making use of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-pig-kidney-transplant-was-a-huge-breakthrough-but-is-it-the-future"&gt;pig kidneys&lt;/a&gt; and developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-experimental-antibody-could-prevent-organ-rejection"&gt;new antibodies&lt;/a&gt;. Broadening the number of compatible kidneys these people can have promises to make a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is what it looks like when years of basic science finally connect to patient care," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/10/universal-organ-transplant/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Withers. "Seeing our discoveries edge closer to real-world impact is what keeps us pushing forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01513-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The tableware was still arranged in tidy stacks as though waiting to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depth, age, and condition of the cargo together suggest a Late Hellenistic to Early Roman date and a rare chance to study daily life through ordinary objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excavation team noted that many of the ceramics have kept their original colors and surface textures, which is unusual for long submersion in seawater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservation labs are documenting the pieces in detail to capture manufacturing marks, slips, and painted motifs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-tableware-stacks-reveal"&gt;What the tableware stacks reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hakan Öniz of &lt;a href="https://www.akdeniz.edu.tr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akdeniz University&lt;/a&gt; led the scientific work at the site; he coordinated divers, surveyed, and handled the artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His group is experienced in underwater archaeology, which explores and preserves human history found beneath lakes and seas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ceramic cargo aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.ub.edu/gracpe/eastern-pottery-in-the-western-mediterranean-the-challenge-of-red-tableware-in-a-black-gloss-ware-world-c-2nd-1st-b-c-e-eastwestpots-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fine, red-slipped tableware widely traded in the eastern Mediterranean during the first century BCE and the first century CE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists use this ware to track production hubs near Antioch and to date shipwrecks tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/1400-year-old-byzantine-treasure-coins-discovered-with-a-metal-detector/"&gt;coastal trade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mapped entry for the Adrasan Plate Wreck records that the cargo consists almost entirely of Eastern &lt;a href="https://www.levantineceramics.org/wares/171-eastern-sigillata-a-esa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sigillata A&lt;/a&gt; forms, mainly plates, cups, and bowls, with little else besides the stacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site’s description places the wreck near 45 meters, or about 148 feet, and dates the material to the first century BCE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniform cargo tells a story about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/discovery-300-year-old-sunken-pirate-shipwreck-left-archaeologists-speechless/"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt;, not ceremony. Merchants moved standardized tableware in bulk because buyers wanted familiar shapes, sizes, and finishes that fit the dining habits of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shipwreck-ceramics-and-map-preserved"&gt;Shipwreck ceramics and map preserved&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team members report a thin coat of raw clay applied to the exterior of many vessels before loading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That simple step acted as a sacrificial layer that blunted abrasion during transport and, later, slowed marine wear on exposed surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once on the seafloor, stacks cushioned by clay and sand created small pockets with less water flow and fewer organisms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those calmer microenvironments helped preserve slips, gloss, and tool marks that usually vanish after centuries underwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceramic specialists read trade like a ledger. When a cargo is dominated by a single ware, they can tie the batch to known workshops, estimate shipping routes, and compare rim and base variants to dated sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Eastern Sigillata A production began in the Antioch region, links between Adrasan and that coast make sense for short-hop voyages along the south Anatolian shore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standardized forms also make it easier to see how tastes spread, since shape catalogs changed over time in ways that archaeologists can measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-shipwreck-to-museum"&gt;From shipwreck to museum&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finds will eventually join displays with other shipwreck collections, including galleries at the &lt;a href="https://www.bodrum-museum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This institution is housed in the medieval castle and focused on submerged cultural heritage. Exhibition designers often present cargo groups intact so visitors can see how goods were packed and protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans are underway for a new Mediterranean Underwater Archaeology Museum in the Kemer Idyros region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be designed to display the Adrasan shipwreck artifacts alongside other discoveries from Turkey’s southern coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative follows reports of more than 400 shipwrecks identified between Patara and Mersin. Such a density emphasizes the considerable maritime &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-antikythera-shipwreck-cosmos-mechanism-reveals-more-secrets/"&gt;heritage&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project also includes year-round conservation efforts and the development of new exhibition spaces in Antalya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks a coordinated effort to link archaeological research with public engagement and cultural tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deciphering-everyday-tableware"&gt;Deciphering everyday tableware&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cargo full of plates and bowls might sound plain, but tableware carries fine-grained clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rim angles, foot rings, slip thickness, and turning lines record workshop habits that changed with fashion and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a shipwreck is dominated by one ware family, those small details become powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can pin down dates to decades rather than centuries, which is why this kind of cargo is prized for building regional timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nested stacks show how shippers maximized space and kept loads from shifting in a swell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw clay coating suggests crew took extra steps to prevent chipping in transit and scuffing during loading through surf or against a quay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the ship went down, the very features meant to protect the cargo in transit became a shield on the bottom. Sand infill and clay crusts sealed motifs and slips that now read like fresh impressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-adrasan-plate-shipwreck-matters"&gt;Why the Adrasan Plate shipwreck matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a high school lab, these dishes are a direct line to questions about production, standards, and markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students can compare forms and think about how a shop keeps quality consistent when making thousands of near-identical plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visitors, seeing the tableware stacks in a museum offers a clear look at daily life two millennia ago. These are not royal gifts or ritual vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they are household goods that fed families, and that human connection lands with unusual clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/103416674/Adrasan_Eastern_Sigillata_A_Plate_Shipwreck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the Adrasan Plate Wreck details the forms and dates within the Eastern Sigillata A family, tying this coast to larger eastern Mediterranean trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study underscores how standardized tableware can anchor chronologies across multiple ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As conservation proceeds, researchers will sample clays and slips to pinpoint production recipes and, by extension, workshop locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those lab results will refine the route map and give teachers and curators fresh material for lessons and labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information from a Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism &lt;a href="https://basin.ktb.gov.tr/TR-398906/bakan-ersoy-sualtindaki-kazi-calismalarini-yerinde-inceledi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 21:12:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPSG9sT3JsNWxFellUbDhQcldOMmdPWDZzNVVHbk5hLVpjRlZFNi1ySkJIUVNUMm9KOGJOdjJVZllCQlBjWU1ud2pZYzFNSDV3RDJsZnd4Xy12RWpzdkpfeElSbmt6N1FxbE1NUHQyUjk0a2xvU2JQNGtONXlJcnk4T1MydkxjYW5YTlZTZEUxYnd5WkpzQ0k3aUYxVk1BRG50OW1CaDR1YmNudw</guid></item><item><title>暴露于任何细菌都可能杀死她。11年后，由于接受了基因治疗，她过上了正常的生活。- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/exposure-germs-ve-killed-11-years-later-s-living-normal-life-thanks-ge-rcna237621</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b2ad9" class="body-graf"&gt;Two months after she was born, Eliana Nachem got a cough that wouldn’t go away. Three weeks later, she also started having runny stool, prompting a visit to her pediatrician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a6b0c" class="body-graf"&gt;Eliana didn’t have allergies or a gastrointestinal condition; instead, tests pointed to a problem with her immune system. At 4 months old, Eliana received her diagnosis: &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/bubble-boy-disease-cured-using-hiv-gene-therapy-st-jude-n995631" target="_blank"&gt;severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a75d42" class="body-graf"&gt;Babies born with the extremely rare disease do not develop the cells required for a functioning &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term-rcna195918" target="_blank"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. Every germ becomes a potentially fatal threat and to stay healthy, children with the condition must live in a completely sterile environment. Without treatment, kids usually do not live past their second birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-250e1d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I expected the worst, then I immediately went into research mode,” Eliana’s father, Jeff Nachem, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbc112" class="body-graf"&gt;The Nachems also got to work turning their home into a germ-free fortress, rehoming their pets, never opening the windows and opening the doors to outside as sparingly as possible. Eliana was kept inside, and on the rare instance when visitors came by, the family had disposable gowns, gloves and masks for them to wear. (SCID is sometimes referred to as “bubble boy disease.”) Eliana also started on a temporary therapy that replaced a missing enzyme in her body, called adenosine deaminase (ADA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c86347" class="body-graf"&gt;In the midst of the strict protocol, they learned about a clinical trial in Los Angeles — 2,600 miles from their home in Fredericksburg, Virginia — that could help their daughter live a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-9211bf"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Jeff-Caroline-Eliana-Dr-Kohn-gene-therapy-ADA-SCID-ew-313p-c2d320.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Jeff-Caroline-Eliana-Dr-Kohn-gene-therapy-ADA-SCID-ew-313p-c2d320.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Jeff-Caroline-Eliana-Dr-Kohn-gene-therapy-ADA-SCID-ew-313p-c2d320.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Jeff-Caroline-Eliana-Dr-Kohn-gene-therapy-ADA-SCID-ew-313p-c2d320.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Jeff-Caroline-Eliana-Dr-Kohn-gene-therapy-ADA-SCID-ew-313p-c2d320.jpg" alt="Jeff, Caroline and Eliana with Dr. Kohn before she underwent gene therapy for ADA-SCID."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Jeff, Caroline and Eliana Nachem with Dr. Donald Kohn before Eliana's gene therapy for ADA-SCID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Caroline Nachem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b0783" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have identified about 20 gene variants that cause SCID. Eliana’s form of the disease, ADA-SCID, is diagnosed in fewer than 10 children born in the U.S. each year. (Under 100 babies are diagnosed with any form of SCID in a given year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-436cd6" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2014, when she was just 10 months old, Eliana was one of 62 children enrolled in a clinical trial for a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pennsylvania-baby-first-receive-personalized-gene-therapy-rcna207100" target="_blank"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; for ADA-SCID. In a study published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502754" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers followed up on the results of that &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027675" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 2 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;. The update reported that all 62 kids, who received the treatment from 2012 to 2019, are alive today. In 59 of them, including Eliana, the gene therapy completely restored immune function, without requiring any additional treatment — a success rate of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-153e3c" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is one of the most successful gene therapy trials for an ultra-rare genetic disease that we have,” said Dr. Talal Mousallem, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Duke University School of Medicine. He was not involved with the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-500bc6" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correcting stem cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa060b" class="body-graf"&gt;The treatment begins with doctors &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/will-really-work-young-sickle-cell-patient-first-start-new-gene-therap-rcna187841" target="_blank"&gt;harvesting stem cells from the patient's own bone marrow&lt;/a&gt;. These stem cells are purified in a lab, and then modified using an inactivated form of the virus that causes HIV. Instead of carrying the human immunodeficiency virus, this version carries the ADA gene that people with ADA-SCID are missing, reinserting the gene into the stem cell DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a8fb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Before the customized treatment is reinfused back into the patient, they must undergo chemotherapy to get rid of the body’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/using-stem-cells-doctors-restore-vision-people-blinded-one-eye-rcna100408" target="_blank"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and make room for the new ones.  Once back in the body, the cells — which no longer carry the virus, just the gene it left behind — get to work building an immune system over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7315b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a one-time delivery vehicle that takes the gene into the DNA of the stem cell, so every time it divides to make other cells, those cells carry that ADA gene,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a pediatric bone marrow transplant physician at UCLA’s Broad Stem Cell Research Center, who led the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-520daf" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A less risky option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-61f0a6" class="body-graf"&gt;Gene therapy clinical trials are underway for four subtypes of SCID, but the standard of care is still a bone marrow transplant, which builds an immune system using stem cells from a donor. The treatment can be risky and side effects further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-628f0d" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s ideal for bone marrow transplants to occur between siblings — who share about half of the same DNA — but two siblings only have about a 25% chance of being a match. In most cases, the donor is not a sibling, which introduces the risk that the donor’s immune cells will attack the recipient’s body, a phenomenon called graft-versus-host disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6de35b" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk of graft-versus-host means kids who receive functioning stem cells from another person have to be on immunosuppressant drugs following the transplant, which keep the foreign cells from attacking their immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d720cb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Which slows down the progress, because you are suppressing the immune system while also trying to build an immune system,” Kohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-247931" class="body-graf"&gt;People also have to undergo much higher doses of chemotherapy before receiving a donor bone marrow transplant than they do before undergoing gene therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3246c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“There can be effects [later in life] from being treated with chemotherapy, including growth, endocrine or fertility effects,” said Dr. Whitney Reid, an attending physician in the division of allergy and immunology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who was not involved in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1840ac" class="body-graf"&gt;With gene therapy, “you can give those patients much lower doses of chemotherapy and there is a much lower chance of rejection,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6fe376"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Eliana-Nachem-ew-312p-2aa2db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Eliana-Nachem-ew-312p-2aa2db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Eliana-Nachem-ew-312p-2aa2db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Eliana-Nachem-ew-312p-2aa2db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-Eliana-Nachem-ew-312p-2aa2db.jpg" alt="Eliana Nachem."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Eliana "was able to go from living in isolation to being able to go to preschool and go swimming in a public pool and play on a playground and do all the things that every other kid gets to do," her father said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Caroline Nachem &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c17f58" class="body-graf"&gt;Having another therapy for ADA-SCID is particularly important, Reid added. Changes in the ADA gene cause toxins to build up in clumps of white blood cells called lymphocytes. This can cause hearing loss and learning difficulties as kids get older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7e091" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike other types of SCID, “it doesn’t only affect the immune system,” Reid said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbf347" class="body-graf"&gt;Mousallem, of Duke University, said he hopes the success of this trial will open the door to gene therapies for other rare diseases that often go untreated, as well as SCID caused by other gene variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de94d8" class="body-graf"&gt;“The data is great for ADA-SCID, and it is our hope that one day this becomes the standard of care,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5bb317" class="body-graf"&gt;Eliana turns 12 years old next week and loves going to dance classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96a27f" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s amazing that she was able to go from living in isolation to being able to go to preschool and go swimming in a public pool and play on a playground and do all the things that every other kid gets to do,” her father said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05d28b" class="body-graf"&gt;Eliana still undergoes testing twice a year to make sure her immune system hasn’t weakened. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a7dcd" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We think it’s a lifelong therapy,” Kohn said. “Some of these kids are now 15 years old and are living normal lives.

&lt;p&gt;The number of AIDS-related deaths has steadily decreased over the years, thanks to awareness campaigns, education and prevention, but people are still dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c43449" data-lang-code="en" data-id="74359583" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More than 800 antibodies tested against HIV&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Florian Klein, Director of the Institute of Virology in Cologne, examined blood samples from 32 people. They were all infected with HIV, but had developed a particularly strong and broadly effective antibody response against the virus, on their own — without any medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested more than 800 different antibodies from these blood samples for their ability to neutralize HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them, named 04_A06, stood out. The antibody blocks a site where the virus binds to cells when it infects a person. It therefore prevents HIV from entering the body's cells. When the virus enters a cell, it reprograms the cell to reproduce the virus, and that weakens the immune system in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibodies in &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/immune-system/t-66950642"&gt;the human immune system&lt;/a&gt; are produced by B lymphocytes, or B cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When B cells detect pathogens, they become plasma cells that release antibodies, such as the 04_A06 antibody discovered by the Cologne researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers decoded this process, or "blueprint," for the 04_A06 antibody in the hope that they could reproduced it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You use the genetic blueprint of the antibody, transfer it to a cell line in the laboratory and use another cell and tell it: Please produce this antibody," Klein told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="69157342" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/69157342_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Person doing an HIV self-test at home; no face visible, just hands, arms, legs and a table with the self-test equipment on it"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Home testing kits: It's been possible for a while now to test your blood for HIV&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: ALICE/BSIP/IMAGO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Antibody 04_A06: HIV treatment and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In experiments with mice that had been infected with HIV, the 04_A06 antibody was seen to neutralize most HIV infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the researchers ran experiments with almost 340 variants of HIV, including those that were resistant to other antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"HIV has a high genetic diversity, the viruses are all quite different," said Klein. "That's what makes HIV so difficult to treat."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the 04_A06 antibody neutralized 98% of the HIV variants they tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the 04_A06 antibody may be able to help people who are already infected with HIV — because it blocks the virus' access to cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It attaches itself to the envelope protein of the virus, so the virus can no longer infect the target cell," said Klein. In addition, viruses blocked by 04_A06 were better recognized and actively eliminated by the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that 04_A06 could also prevent HIV infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The antibody intercepts viruses before they can infect cells and multiply in the body," said Klein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the newly discovered antibody could act as a passive immunization. An active immunization would be a vaccine that enables the body to produce antibodies itself. But there is no HIV vaccine as yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The state of HIV vaccine development and medication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies into an HIV &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/vaccines-and-vaccination/t-73605776"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; based on mRNA technology are ongoing. Researchers aim to stimulate an immune response with a protein taken from the HIV envelope. That is the virus' outer coat, which, like the one of the virus that causes &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/covid-19/t-62123668"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, has protein spikes embedded in it that enable the virus to attach itself to cells and infect them. However, this method has so far only been tested for one HIV variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klein said it will be a challenge to induce the body's own production of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies with an active vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="70324847" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/70324847_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Hands holding a vial of lenacapavir "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;HIV prevention with "depot" function: Lenacapavir is now also approved in the EU&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Nardus Engelbrecht/AP/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various medicines are offered as pills or injections as a prophylactic measure against HIV infection. And they are very successful. However, the tablets usually have to be taken daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are long-acting, injectable prophylaxis drugs, such as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/miracle-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-approved-amid-drastic-us-health-budget-cuts/a-73023089"&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt; or cabotegravir, that create a "depot" function in the body. The depot allows the body to release the active ingredient slowly. And that means you only need two injections per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klein said the idea behind antibody prophylaxis with 04_A06 was, "that you [could] do without tablets, because you would have a more than 90% chance of preventing an infection." An antibody prophylaxis using 04_A06 would have to be taken approximately every six months, much like lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to the 04_A06 antibody&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found other broadly &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-cure-research-progress-2025/a-71445979"&gt;neutralizing antibodies against HIV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Alexandra Trkola, Director of the Institute of Medical Virology at the University of Zurich said, "04_A06 is definitely an extraordinarily potent representative of this group."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antibody's potency determines how many — or how few — of the antibodies are needed to create a strong effect. This is important if the Cologne discovery is to become a drug that is administered by injection, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potency also determines how often you would need an injection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Theoretically, 04_A06 alone achieves an efficacy that is otherwise only achieved in antibody combinations," said Trkola, who was not part of the research in Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it will probably be a while before 04_A06 becomes a drug, said Christoph Spinner, Head of Infectiology at the &lt;em&gt;Klinikum rechts der Isar&lt;/em&gt; at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cologne study has so far only involved laboratory data, said Spinner, who was also not involved in the research. "So, the effectiveness cannot be directly transferred to real life."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further studies on the dosage, people's tolerance to it and its efficacy would need to follow, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trkola agreed it was not yet possible to predict whether the antibody would prove its efficacy in clinical use but added that the signs were "definitely promising."&lt;/p&gt;

To test how these sleep stages impact our memories, the researchers asked 32 healthy young adults to learn 96 word-picture pairs — such as an action word linked to an image of an animal or plant — while their brain activity was recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG), which monitors brain waves that wash over the surface of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="431ce66b-f5c9-4e2d-8056-5c170de07a8a"&gt;The volunteers were then monitored with EEG as they slept overnight and had their recall tested the next morning.

These data enabled the scientists to focus both on detailed memories tied to specific images — like a photo of a beagle — and on broader, categorical memories, covering all the animal images, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By using EEG, we could track how brain activity linked to memories changed from before to after sleep," first study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jing-Liu-32" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jing-Liu-32" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jing Liu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research assistant professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team uncovered a pattern: Brainwaves linked to the individual images weakened after sleep, while the broader category signals remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift was stronger when REM made up more of an individual's total sleep time, compared to deep sleep. Liu explained that this pattern suggests REM sleep may help the brain link new memories with what it already knows, while slow-wave sleep helps keep those memories in their original, more-detailed form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dtFopSWw9N3XN3L5YAoW6H" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dtFopSWw9N3XN3L5YAoW6H slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when people remembered the same things after waking, the brain patterns behind those memories had shifted," she added. This suggests sleep not only strengthens memories but may reorganize how they're represented in the brain, with REM and slow-wave sleep contributing in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these results add to evidence that memory consolidation — the brain's process of stabilizing and reorganizing new memories — involves both preservation and transformation. Rather than storing memories of experiences exactly as they happened, the brain may be subtly restructuring them during sleep, balancing accuracy with generalization. The distinction, the researchers noted, could help explain how knowledge networks in the brain evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the pattern doesn't necessarily mean that deep sleep and REM sleep work in opposition to one another. Rather, the two phases support different facets of remembering, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/george-dragoi/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/george-dragoi/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. George Dragoi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Yale University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results here point to a complementary role of REM and slow-wave sleep in different types of memory," he said, such as general knowledge and facts versus memories of specific experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d276ea28-a41c-4187-aeb8-8685eaee2802"&gt;He added that keeping regular sleep schedules may help support these processes, since good sleep quality is broadly linked to healthy cognitive function. "Longer REM periods may promote the kind of memory transformation this study highlights," he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu, however, cautioned that the results show associations, not causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[EEG] prevents us from precisely identifying the brain regions driving these changes," she said, adding that combining EEG with recordings taken directly from electrodes placed inside the skull could clarify the circuitry behind the effect. She also pointed to future studies that might try to reactivate specific memories during sleep — for instance, by replaying sounds or cues linked to earlier learning — or interrupt particular sleep stages to see whether that changes how flexibly people can use what they've learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="7e68f41c-7698-4ff9-b94b-bc1a7739dc30"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-c3b4300d-34c2-478c-ad49-01741c6c4a35" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams"&gt;Science of sleep quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How much do you know about sleep and dreams?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pomegranate juice may help lower blood pressure, although the evidence is conflicting on its effectiveness as a natural remedy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polyphenols in pomegranate may help lower blood pressure by improving arterial function, increasing nitric oxide production, and inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doses of around 300 milliliters per day have been used in studies, with upset stomach, nausea, and constipation being the most common side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies suggest that drinking pomegranate juice may help lower your systolic and diastolic blood pressure, although findings are mixed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-does-pomegranate-juice-actually-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Does Pomegranate Juice Actually Lower Your Blood Pressure? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some research suggests that regular consumption of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pomegranate-juice-may-interact-with-certain-medications-89171" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pomegranate juice&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP, the top number) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, the bottom number) in individuals with &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypertension-7368341" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure (hypertension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypertension-7368341" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nevertheless, the findings are inconsistent, with some studies showing a greater benefit than others:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pomegranate's effects may depend on how much you consume:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2023 review found that drinking 10 ounces of pomegranate juice daily lowered SBP by an average of six mmHg. Higher amounts &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/systolic-and-diastolic-blood-pressure-1746075" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;didn't reduce SBP further, but did lower DBP&lt;/a&gt; by about three mmHg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pomegranate's effects may or may not be long-lasting: &lt;/strong&gt;The 2023 study suggests pomegranate’s blood pressure-lowering effects may wear off after two months, while a 2017 review reported more stable, long-term benefits for SBP.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pomegranate's effectiveness can vary:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2024 review found greater SBP reductions from pomegranate juice in people with &lt;strong&gt;baseline SBP over&lt;/strong&gt; 130 mmHg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pomegranate's effects are not a sure thing:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2017 review of six clinical trials found mixed results on pomegranate’s effect on blood pressure—some showed a benefit, others did not.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-pomegranate-juice-work-for-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does Pomegranate Juice Work for Blood Pressure? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pomegranate (&lt;em&gt;&lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;Punica granatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; L.) is a nutritious fruit rich in &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These compounds are thought to reduce blood pressure due to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/superfoods-8726545" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The most active antioxidants in pomegranate (&lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;pedunculagin&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;punicalin&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;gallagic&lt;/span&gt; acid) influence blood pressure in three key ways:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced oxidative stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Antioxidants work by neutralizing unstable molecules called &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/information-about-free-radicals-2249103" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;, which can damage arteries and cause them to lose their elasticity. By correcting the imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants (referred to as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/oxidative-stress-8351176" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;), the polyphenols may improve arterial function and help ease blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking ACE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ace-inhibitors-blood-pressure-control-in-diabetes-1087278" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;ACE inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; are a class of drugs that reduce blood pressure by blocking &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/heart-failure-medications-types-and-available-options-7567297" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&lt;/a&gt;, which causes blood vessels to narrow. Pedunculagin, punicalin, and gallagic acid act similarly to ACE inhibitors by causing blood vessels to widen, decreasing blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased nitric oxide: &lt;/strong&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas synthesized in the body that relaxes the lining of blood vessels. Pedunculagin stimulates the release of enzymes that trigger the synthesis of NO, thereby reducing blood pressure as NO levels increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pomegranate juice is generally regarded as safe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is rich in nutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin K, folate, potassium, and magnesium, and contains approximately 165 calories per 1-cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Due to its high sugar content (approximately 26 grams per cup), pomegranate juice may not be suitable for individuals with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are no significant drug interactions with pomegranate juice,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and no known risk in people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even so, speak with a healthcare provider before using pomegranate to treat any medical condition.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Various compounds in pomegranate have been studied for their potential use in treating or preventing a range of medical condtions, including:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin health:&lt;/strong&gt; Polyphenols in pomegranate, called &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;ellagitannins&lt;/span&gt;, have anti-inflammatory effects that may help speed wound healing and slow skin aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dental care:&lt;/strong&gt; The polyphenols in pomegranate have antibacterial properties that may reduce bacteria that produce dental plaque and lower their ability to cling to teeth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes:&lt;/strong&gt; Ellagitannins block enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion, which may help lower blood sugar spikes after meals. They also stimulate glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion, similar to drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic (semaglutide), which improve insulin sensitivity and reduce appetite.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart health:&lt;/strong&gt; A polyphenol in pomegranate called punicalagin may help prevent fatty deposits in arteries, known as &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-atherosclerosis-1745908" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It may also help stabilize arterial plaques, preventing them from breaking off and causing a heart attack or stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Researchers recorded live neural activity in epilepsy patients and found that while each person’s neurons respond differently to the same image, the &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; between those neural responses remain consistent across individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shared relational pattern allows different brains to interpret the same scene — like a dog running on the beach — in similar ways. The findings shed light on the universal structure of perception and may help refine artificial intelligence models inspired by human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Yet Alike:&lt;/strong&gt; Each person’s neurons fire differently, but the relationships between their activity patterns are consistent across people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Perception:&lt;/strong&gt; This common relational code explains how humans interpret the world similarly despite individual neural wiring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding how the brain organizes perception could improve artificial neural networks and machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Reichman Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it that we all see the world in a similar way? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine sitting with a friend in a café, both of you looking at a phone screen displaying a dog running along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although each of our  brains is a world unto itself, made up of billions of neurons with completely different connections and unique activity patterns, you would both describe it as: “A dog on the beach.” How can two such different brains lead to the same perception of the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint research team from Reichman University and the Weizmann Institute of Science investigated how people with different wired brains can still perceive the world in strikingly similar ways. E&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;very image we see and every sound we hear is encoded in the brain through the activation of tiny processing units called &lt;em&gt;neurons&lt;/em&gt; – nerve cells that are ten times smaller than a human hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains 85 billion interconnecting neurons that enable us to experience the world, think, and respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question that has intrigued brain researchers for years is how this encoding is performed, and how it is possible for two people to have completely different neural codes, yet, end-up with  similar perceptions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Reichman University graduate student Ofer Lipman and supervised by Prof. Rafi Malach and Dr. Shany Grossman from the Weizmann Institute and Prof. Doron Friedman and Prof. Yacov Hel-Or from Reichman University, set out to observe how brain neurons encode information in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a most challenging task as most brain-imaging methods provide only a low resolution picture, similar to a satellite photo of a city where you can see the highways but not the people on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this challenge, the researchers drew on a unique source of data: epilepsy patients with electrodes implanted in their brains for medical purposes. While the implants were placed to help doctors locate the epicenter of the patients’ seizures, they also offered the researchers a rare window into the activity of brain neurons  – recorded live and not simulated or inferred – while the patients viewed images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher team discovered that, just as in artificial neural networks (the technology behind AI), the raw patterns of activity in the human brain differs from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When observing a cat, the neurons that “light up” (are active) in one person’s brain may be different neurons in another person’s brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here is the surprising finding: When the researchers shifted from examining the raw activity of neurons to observing the &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; between the general activity patterns in the neurons – i.e. how strongly the brain responds overall to a cat versus a dog – they discovered a common relational structure across all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if one brain’s general activity in response to a cat is more similar to its response to a dog than to, say, an elephant, that same relationship is likely to hold in all other brains. In other words, the actual activity patterns in different brains may not be identical, but the relationship between them is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This relational representation may be the brain’s way of organizing information so that all humans can understand the world in a similar way, even when the underlying neural coding differs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study brings us one step closer to deciphering the brain’s ‘representational code’ – the language in which our brains store and organize Information,” explains Lipman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This understanding helps advance not only neuroscience, but also AI: insights into how the brain represents information can inspire the design of more efficient and intelligent artificial networks, and vice versa  – artificial networks can generate insights that deepen our knowledge of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study forms a part of a broad series of works in which researchers compare the representation of information in natural networks (the human brain) with the representation of information in artificial networks (AI). This integration opens the door to a richer understanding of ourselves and the systems we build.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you see a dog running on the beach and you think “a dog,” remember that behind this simple thought lies a vast and complex code that science is only beginning to crack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760553383275"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How can two different brains see the same thing in the same way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Although neurons differ across individuals, the &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; between neural responses to objects—like how the brain reacts to a cat versus a dog—follow a universal pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760553393662"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How did researchers study this phenomenon of shared perception?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: They recorded real-time neuron activity from epilepsy patients with brain implants, providing direct insight into how information is represented in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760553417973"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does this matter beyond neuroscience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The discovery bridges human cognition and artificial intelligence, showing how understanding the brain’s representational code could guide the design of more efficient AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this perception and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81ede8f5e0edafe3e4efe0f3e8c1e8e5e2afe0e2afe8ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lital Ben Ari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://idc.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reichman Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lital Ben Ari – Reichman Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62551-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Invariant inter-subject relational structures in high order human visual cortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Ofer Lipman et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invariant inter-subject relational structures in high order human visual cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a fundamental of behavior that different individuals see the world in a largely similar manner. This is an essential basis for humans’ ability to cooperate and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what are the neural properties that underlie these inter-subject commonalities of our visual world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding out what aspects of neural coding remain invariant across individuals’ brains will shed light not only on this fundamental question but will also point to the neural coding scheme at the basis of visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we address this question by obtaining intracranial recordings from three groups of patients taking part in a visual recognition task (overall 19 patients and 244 high-order visual contacts included in the analyses) and examining the neural coding scheme that was most consistent across individuals’ visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight &lt;em&gt;relational&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;coding&lt;/em&gt; – expressed by the set of similarity distances between profiles of pattern activations—as the most consistent representation across individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative coding schemes, such as activation pattern coding or linear coding, failed to achieve similar inter-subject consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results thus support &lt;em&gt;relational coding&lt;/em&gt; as the central neural code underlying individuals’ shared perceptual content in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:40:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1OcUYtTE5iZFljU1lvdW9NMWl4eW5XcTZFTTJDYXRqeWg3czl3c25ISWdlWnhOTlUzLXdfVUp0TS1GYmQwQy15T3o0YkZWOFc2cjU3RkFCd0xjZjFVSllFUWJINE9MbnZyaTg1RUxYb1ZOcHpGeVE</guid></item><item><title>肌萎缩侧索硬化和多发性硬化症可能有共同的环境原因，地理模式揭示- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-multiple-environmental.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18755-8" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt; indicates that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) have an extremely high geographic association, even after controlling for race, gender, wealth, latitude, and access to neurological health care.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"The results of the study are surprising because previous studies have typically concluded there was no evidence for a mechanistic or genetic link between the two diseases," explains study author Melissa Schilling, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who specializes in analyzing large-scale datasets using econometrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat maps show the geographic patterns of the diseases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also shows that the relationship between the two diseases has likely been overlooked until now because of a "Simpson's Paradox"—a statistical phenomenon whereby a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the groups are based on gender: both women and men show a strong positive correlation (greater than 70%) in the geographic distribution of ALS and MS, but when the data are pooled across gender, these relationships are obscured because, on average, ALS is more common in men and MS is more common in women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several decades, researchers have noted a north-south gradient in the distribution of MS. This led to speculation that UV light or vitamin D might play a role in the disease, but studies that supplemented MS patients with UV light or vitamin D had minimal or inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in the new study indicate that MS and ALS have a much stronger geographic relationship with each other than with latitude, suggesting that both diseases may share a connection to a factor that varies imperfectly with latitude.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"I started gathering and analyzing every dataset I could find relevant to ALS about nine years ago when a friend with ALS asked me if I would take a look at the data," says Schilling. "I was very surprised to find such a strong geographic pattern as most of the research on ALS does not emphasize the role of geography. I was even more surprised to find that ALS has a very strong association with the geography of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This finding is important because it suggests that an environmental factor likely plays a significant role in both diseases, and that could provide clues that help us determine what causes them and how they might be avoided or treated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements of the environment that vary imperfectly with the north-south gradient include natural things like viruses, parasites, algae, and molds, as well as human-made elements or practices like the use of heating oil, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/agricultural+practices/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;agricultural practices&lt;/a&gt;, industrial practices, mining, and chemical contamination of fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The list of suspects is long, but comparing across geographies and, in particular, across outlier locations, such as the Faroe Islands, where MS increased strikingly after military troops arrived there in the 1940s, could significantly narrow the hunt," observes Schilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study combined mortality and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/demographic+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;demographic data&lt;/a&gt; obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database (in the US, the collection of mortality data is mandatory and standardized) with latitude data, economic data, and data on access to neurological health care. The primary results are based on US crude mortality rates at the state level. The analysis was then replicated at the global level using mortality data from the World Health Organization and obtained nearly identical results.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A person living in the suburbs of New York City has tested positive for &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-mosquitoes-chikungunya-explainer-050e53750c8c041fc72b7cf62c01b92f"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a mosquito-borne virus that is more often seen in South America and hasn’t been transmitted on the U.S. mainland in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the virus, which often causes fever and joint pain, was identified in a patient on Long Island who started experiencing symptoms in August after having traveled outside of the region, but not out of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient likely got the virus from a mosquito bite, but it isn’t clear where that happened. The virus has not been detected in local mosquito pools and isn’t spread directly from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about chikungunya: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is chikungunya?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is a disease caused by a virus of the same name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in people sickened during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Its name is derived from a word in the Makonde language, which means “that which bends up,” due to the severe pain it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly causes mild symptoms. The majority of people who get chikungunya recover without needing medical attention after one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of chikungunya?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya typically produces symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue and a rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in rare cases, it can cause debilitating joint pain that persists for months or even years. Patients who get severely ill often require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a treatment or vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two vaccines have been approved in several regions, including Britain, Brazil, Canada and Europe. Those are mostly targeted at travelers and are not widely available in the countries most affected by chikungunya. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Where does chikungunya normally occur? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya causes regular outbreaks in Africa, Asia and the Americas, with occasional small epidemics in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of August, there have been about 317,000 cases of chikungunya this year, including 135 deaths in 16 countries and territories, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The countries that reported the highest number of infections were Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Peru. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s happening in the United States? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case confirmed in New York was the first locally acquired instance in the United States since 2015, meaning the person was infected without traveling elsewhere. Ten years ago, one person was infected in Texas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two cases were recorded in U.S. territories in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time that a locally acquired case has ever been detected in New York, the state Health Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the virus can be transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected traveler, becomes infected and bites another person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of mosquito known to transmit chikungunya, the Aedes albopictus mosquito, is present in parts of downstate New York, and people should take care to avoid being bitten by wearing long sleeves and removing standing water from things like flowerpots, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;However, colder nighttime temperatures currently being recorded in New York make the transmission risk in the area “very low,” state Health Commissioner James McDonald said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although locally acquired cases have been virtually nonexistent in recent years, the CDC has tracked a number of travel-related infections in the U.S., including 199 in 2024 and 152 in 2023, according to agency data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are we seeing more chikungunya outbreaks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of outbreaks has increased since 2000, just as there have been more outbreaks of other mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue and Zika, according to Robert Jones, an assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said in a statement that in 2013, chikungunya was first seen in the island of St. Martin and that over the next three years, cases were confirmed in almost 50 countries in the Caribbean and the Americas, with more than 1 million suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Jones said the risk of chikungunya epidemics has risen due to climate change and urban expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The research found that both negative and positive childhoods are linked to an individual’s capacity for long-term perseverance, and this relationship is entirely explained by their ability to manage emotions. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941251363891" target="_blank"&gt;Psychological Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of grit, defined as the passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals, is a strong predictor of success in many areas of life. While it is known that grit can be shaped by a person’s upbringing, the specific pathways through which childhood experiences influence this trait are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by Bhoomika N. Jadhav from the Vellore Institute of Technology in India sought to investigate this connection more deeply. They were particularly interested in Generation Z, a generation that grew up in an era of rapid technological and social change. The researchers hypothesized that emotional regulation, the ability to control one’s own emotional responses, might be the missing link that explains how childhood events affect a person’s later grittiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the research team conducted a cross-sectional study involving 548 young adults in India. All participants were born in 1997 or later, placing them in the Generation Z cohort, with an average age of about 20 years old. Data was collected using an electronic survey that included a series of established self-report questionnaires. This method allowed the researchers to gather information on four distinct psychological constructs from each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed the Short Grit Scale to measure their level of perseverance and passion for long-term goals. They also filled out the Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire, which asks about ten different types of negative experiences before the age of 18, including abuse, neglect, and household challenges. To capture the positive side of upbringing, the researchers used the Benevolent Childhood Experiences scale, which assesses supportive and comforting experiences, such as feeling safe and having a caregiver to confide in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to measure emotional regulation, participants responded to items from the Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test that specifically assessed their ability to manage their own emotions and the emotions of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial analysis of the data revealed clear and significant associations between the variables. As the researchers expected, young adults who reported a higher number of adverse childhood experiences also tended to report lower levels of both grit and emotional regulation. This finding is consistent with a large body of previous research showing the lasting negative impact of early life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also confirmed the beneficial effects of a positive upbringing. Participants who reported more benevolent childhood experiences showed a strong tendency to have higher levels of both grit and emotional regulation. These initial correlations established that a person’s childhood environment, whether negative or positive, was directly related to their capacity for perseverance and their ability to manage feelings in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central part of the investigation involved a more advanced statistical method known as structural equation modeling. This technique allowed the researchers to test whether emotional regulation acted as a mediator, or a pathway, between childhood experiences and grit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model showed that emotional regulation fully mediated the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and grit. This means that the negative impact of adversity on grit was completely explained by its negative impact on emotional regulation. In other words, a difficult childhood appears to diminish grit primarily by hindering a person’s development of emotional management skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern emerged for positive experiences. The analysis also confirmed that emotional regulation fully mediated the connection between benevolent childhood experiences and grit. A supportive and safe childhood does not appear to directly create a grittier adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it seems to build a person’s capacity for emotional regulation, and it is this enhanced emotional skill that fosters greater perseverance and passion for long-term goals. For both negative and positive childhoods, the direct statistical link to grit disappeared once emotional regulation was accounted for, indicating its central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note some limitations to their study. The findings are based on self-report questionnaires, which can be affected by factors like memory bias or the desire to answer in a socially acceptable way. The study’s design was cross-sectional, meaning all data was collected at a single point in time. This approach can identify strong associations but cannot definitively prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longitudinal study that follows individuals over many years would be needed to confirm that childhood experiences lead to changes in emotional regulation, which in turn shape grit. The sample was also limited to literate, English-speaking young adults in India, so the findings may not be generalizable to all populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers important directions for future research and practical applications. Future studies could explore these relationships in different cultural contexts or use longitudinal designs to track development over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint, the findings suggest that efforts to build grit, particularly in young adults who have faced adversity, should focus on strengthening emotional regulation skills. Programs that teach individuals how to identify, understand, and manage their feelings may be highly effective in helping them cultivate the perseverance needed to achieve their long-term ambitions. The research also highlights the protective power of a positive childhood, suggesting that promoting supportive and stable environments for children is an effective way to foster emotionally healthy and resilient adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941251363891" target="_blank"&gt;The Association of Adverse and Benevolent Childhood Experiences with Grit Among Gen Z: The Mediating Role of Emotional Regulation&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Bhoomika N.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Weight loss drugs have profound health impacts, and researchers at Virginia Tech said they’ve discovered another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with serious health risks, including liver disease and increased cancer rates. However, a new study from the university reveals that GLP-1 agonist drugs — commonly used for weight loss — affect alcohol absorption in the same way they influence food digestion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These medications slow the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine, helping users feel full longer and eat less. Similarly, they delay the rate at which alcohol enters the bloodstream, meaning it takes longer to feel the effects of a drink. Essentially, it takes longer to get that buzz, and most people who drink socially don’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delayed rewards just aren’t as good as immediate ones,” said Alex DiFeliceantonio, an assistant professor in Virginia Tech’s department of human nutrition, foods and exercise who co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17927-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to feeling buzzed immediately after downing a shot or two of liquor, that won’t be the case while on weight loss drugs. While the body does eventually absorb the alcohol, it’s going to take longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But that early on of when you kind of are just drinking and you’re feeling those effects of drinking, if you delay that, people seem to like drinking less,” DiFeliceantonio said. “If you change that feeling, you can change the addictive potential of the drug, and you can kind of just change how people interact with the drug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which weight loss drug someone was on, she added, the results were pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t really have a lot of great treatments for alcohol use disorder. Relapse is very common,” DiFeliceantonio said. “Maybe these drugs could be useful for helping people who really want to cut back on their drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The classic example of a hijack is masturbation,” Edward Slingerland tells me. We’re talking about all the evolutionary quirks that humans tend to exploit — the cases where we’re “built” for one purpose, but decide to put that structure to other uses. And masturbation is a classic example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this week’s &lt;a href="https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/"&gt;Mini Philosophy interview&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke with Slingerland about his book &lt;em&gt;Drunk&lt;/em&gt;, in which he outlines his “intoxication thesis.” Slingerland argues it’s quite common to think that getting drunk is an evolutionary mistake. Some early &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; drank too much fermented fruit juice and discovered it was pretty fun. So they told their mates and, altogether, they clinked their frothy ciders and sang bawdy songs about hunting and gathering. But the human brain and body were not built to get drunk. Alcohol is effectively a poison. Our bodies don’t like it — or so the argument goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intoxication thesis says this is all wrong. For Slingerland, drinking alcohol and getting drunk are important to human well-being and complex societies. It might not be what evolution “intended,” but it’s certainly given us a reproductive and interspecies advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how is getting drunk different from other “evolutionary mistakes”? And what possible benefits might getting drunk give us? Today, we find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-classic-example"&gt;The classic example&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that masturbation is the “classic example” of an evolutionary mistake is that there’s a very obvious and simple answer as to why an orgasm feels great — it is nature’s reward for doing what our genes really “want” us to do: copy themselves into the next generation. This is what evolutionary biologists call the “adaptive target” of the orgasm. Have sex, reproduce, copy your genes, and you’ll get this surge of dopamine, oxytocin, and lovely, lovely endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But humans and other animals have figured out you can get that reward in lots of wildly non-reproductive ways,” Slingerland tells me. “And once we figured that out, we did that all the time. So here’s the classic ‘mistake,’ right: There’s no relationship between an orgasm and reproduction. Evolution doesn’t want us to masturbate, but it doesn’t care because it’s a relatively non-costly behavior. Contrary to what you may have learned in school, it won’t make you go blind. It’s basically low-cost enough that evolution can kind of let it go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, from an evolutionary point of view, the cost of masturbation and hijacking the pleasure surge of an orgasm is worth it, so long as humans do, at least a few times, still have an orgasm during reproductive sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-twinkie-problem"&gt;The Twinkie problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other kind of evolutionary mistake is what Slingerland calls the “Twinkie problem,” which is when the body’s reward system was once connected to a certain evolutionarily beneficial behavior, but our environment has now changed so much that the reward system is actually detrimental to our well-being. This is how Slingerland describes it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re evolutionarily designed to enjoy fat and sugar. We’ll consume it in large quantities whenever we can get it. And that’s great because for almost all of our evolutionary history, and actually for a disturbing number of people still today, getting enough sugar and fat is a problem. And so, you should try to gorge on it whenever you get it. But it becomes a problem when you live in a modern industrialized society and you’re relatively wealthy. You can gorge on Twinkies and potato chips and ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this type of mistake is costly because it causes obesity, diabetes, and all these problems, but it’s very recent, evolutionarily, and it’s geographically still constrained. Again, there are places in the world where you still have trouble getting enough food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, while the Twinkie problem is a problem for a growing portion of society, it’s not enough of a problem to fade away — not least because the time scale’s too short for any kind of adaptation. Maybe, in the future, diabetes and obesity will kill off those who really enjoy fat and sugar, and so change the reward system. But that’d be in the far distant future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-benefits-of-alcohol"&gt;The benefits of alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional view of alcohol is to see it like masturbation. It’s a mistake that only a few abuse, and so evolution has no “need” to get rid of our enjoyment of getting drunk. We have a reward system, and we’ve realized we can trigger it by drinking this fermented fruit juice. We’re like rats pushing the button to get more cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Slingerland’s intoxication thesis argues that this cannot be true “because our taste for alcohol is ancient and ubiquitous and costly. Evolution doesn’t let that kind of mistake slide. And so, getting drunk has got to have a benefit that’s kept it in our repertoire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slingerland’s book explores what he considers to be a range of benefits, but in our interview, we focused mostly on two:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there is a social aspect to getting drunk. When we drink with someone, we not only have the bonding experience of mutual enjoyment, but also come together in mutual vulnerability. When you are drunk, you’re easy to kill. When you’re staggering home, narrowly avoiding lampposts, it’s easy to steal your phone, your wallet, and your jacket. To be drunk with someone is an act of trust. It says, “I think so much of you that I’m willing to let my guard down.” And so, getting drunk is a kind of “chemical handshake” that lets the other person know you are someone to trust. Societies operate on trust, and alcohol is a kind of “social technology” that builds trust between potentially warring rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, there is the creative aspect of being drunk. This isn’t (just) about Lennon and McCartney getting high and writing “Strawberry Fields Forever”; this is about the thinking-outside-the-box skills we need to survive and thrive. This is how Slingerland put it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one of the main functions of alcohol is to depress selectively the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It turns the PFC down a few notches and helps us get back to that childlike state of mind where suddenly we see connections we wouldn’t see otherwise. Parts of our brain can talk to each other in ways that they don’t when the PFC is in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, let’s say you sit down and you need to come up with a new idea. You have a couple of drinks. You are individually more creative because your brain is now de-patterned in a certain way. Plus, because you’re disinhibited—again, because the PFC has been turned down—you’re more likely to blurt out something to someone else that maybe you would be self-conscious about, or maybe you think it is a dumb idea. You’ll suddenly be like, well, why don’t we try this for getting gazelles?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Slingerland’s argument is that our so-called “evolutionary mistakes” often reveal evolution’s hidden genius. Masturbation, sugar binges, and drunken nights look like misfires in nature’s design—but they’ve helped us adapt. We’ve taken reward systems meant for survival and reproduction and retooled them for connection, innovation, and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

known.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease most common in tropical and subtropical regions and symptoms include fever and joint pain, headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The disease cannot be spread directly from one person to another, authorities said, and the risk to the public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The illness is rarely fatal, and most patients recover within a week, though some may experience persistent joint pain, authorities continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT
