A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;landmark trial unveiled earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; found people at risk of developing dementia improved their cognitive scores after implementing diet changes, as well as exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, recent studies have shown foods rich in nutrients like protein, antioxidants and carbohydrates could reduce the risk the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs, which were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14133867/surprising-link-eggs-dementia-risk.html"&gt;long demonized for high fat and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular are enjoying a health renaissance for containing brain-healthy amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berries and dark, leafy greens, meanwhile are rich in antioxidants that protect brain cells responsible for memory shielded from inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And even dark chocolate may improve blood flow to the brain and boost functioning in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Daily Mail has revealed the best dementia-fighting foods below.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies have revealed the foods that are most likely to stave off dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs are a key feature in the standard American diet, with more than one in three adults claiming they have them for breakfast on a given day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg contains about 150 milligrams of choline, about one-quarter of the recommended daily value. Choline is an essential nutrient also found in protein sources such as salmon and beef and chicken livers that supports memory, mood and muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to boost levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which controls memory and learning, and reduce levels of neurotoxins like homocysteine that damage neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eggs are rich in brain-healthy nutrients like choline, which supports memory and learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662400289X"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that older adults who consumed more than one egg per week had a 47 percent reduced risk of dementia compared to those who had less than one egg in a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the Rush University Memory and Aging Project in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-b7c70501-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, noted this was likely due to the choline in the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/19/3340"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; looked at more than 400 adults in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-b7c70500-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; over age 50, half of whom were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that participants who ate eggs every day had a lower risk of dementia than those eating them only weekly or monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg also contains six grams of protein, which provides amino acids needed to produce neurotransmitters like serotonin. Serotonin is crucial for cognitive function and reducing levels of toxic amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Berries are rich in antioxidants, which reduce inflammation in the brain and prevent brain volume from shrinking (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, among others, are well known for containing antioxidants, substances that protect cells from damage caused by toxic molecules called free radicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left unchecked, free radicals induce oxidative stress, leading to inflammation and the production of amyloid-beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Found in the brain's gray matter, amyloid-beta builds up and forms plaques, which attack brain cells and cause overall brain volume to shrink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12743301/strawberries-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Cincinnati found that adults between 50 and 65 who ate a cup of strawberries every day for 12 weeks performed better on memory tests and had fewer symptoms of depression than those who took a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those researchers also published a recent study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/8/1619/htm"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that found regular consumption of blueberries reduced signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berries are a staple of the MIND diet, a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension) diets that prioritizes anti-inflammatory foods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dark chocolate contains compounds called flavonoids, which increase blood flow to the brain and prevent damage (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chocolate is generally seen as a 'guilty pleasure' and something most people should limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in moderation, dark chocolate has been shown to lower the risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate is rich in flavonoids, compounds found in plant-based foods that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, much like berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flavonoids also increase blood flow to the brain, preventing damage and improving overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bar of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 200 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams depending on the size, manufacturer and cacao percentage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;Nature Food&lt;/a&gt; of 125,000 people found those who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, including dark chocolate, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-brain-on-chocolate-2017081612179"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that among adults ages 50 to 69, those who took a cocoa supplement with high flavanol content for three months performed better on memory tests than those who took supplements with lower flavanol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Whole grains and nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unsalted nuts have been shown to lower dementia risk in older adults (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like eggs, carbs have long been considered a nutritional boogeyman due to the risks of weight gain, high blood sugar and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High glucose (blood sugar) levels can damage brain cells and blood vessels in the brain, potentially leading to dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But whole grains like wheat, brown rice and oats contain complex carbohydrates, which digest slowly and provide the body with a steady, regulated flow of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole grains also are high in fiber, which ferments in the gut to form short-chain fatty acids that regulate inflammation in the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=whole+grains+dementia+study&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCPF_enUS1174US1174&amp;amp;oq=whole+grains+dementia+study&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRirAjIHCAUQIRirAjIHCAYQIRiPAjIHCAcQIRiPAjIHCAgQIRiPAtIBCDM1MjdqMGo5qAIAsAIB&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Neurology found participants who consumed whole grains regularly had a slower rate of memory decline with age than those who did not eat these foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nuts, meanwhile, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may increase the volume of the brain's memory center, the hippocampus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11979034/"&gt;published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; found eating a handful of unsalted nuts a day was enough to lower the overall risk of developing dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like berries, whole grains and nuts are both staples of the MIND diet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 16:01:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQWGVHM283ZGljaVgtbzRocmR6XzJrWnhwZ2tpTXd2bHlWVnZ6RVJWamFEM21WcUhlODFXZnJnaWpROHdPNE1yc3ZyVDNQLTkzRUJaWEhGZ2xDYlBiNzVEZVBabUozS1ZRWlNWZ25IRVhjNDlKX3B2eVVWMGt3bmxDbEF2TjlZbHlQeUx0d2pjaE5IZ0FNNzYyb1paMHYtZS1KdDExTkZDQi1iMDDSAbABQVVfeXFMT1Z5S0Vra1plNGEyYnppcXBXQlZxNExka1RBOTVDLVJORDkyem1pSDJmYmE0OEdyZEZKa3kwMnozQ0w1MlpiNHdNcDF6Ty1FRVpZSUtZaXpOWFFMT2Jld2UxRzJDY2dheW9ObUw3UWVXZk1vcy05dXpJaFhHbWNkcFJrUWhxNXdTdTNyQUdqR3JrMm41RDgwX2pxM0F1T2YzOTJPRjFMODZ6R2dxaWdoaEs</guid></item><item><title>心理学家说， 8种奇怪的具体爱好比正念更能减少焦虑- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/z-8-weirdly-specific-hobbies-psychologists-say-reduce-anxiety-better-than-mindfulness/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="371" data-end="579"&gt;We’ve all been told that mindfulness is the holy grail for managing anxiety. And sure—it helps. Sitting still, focusing on your breath, observing your thoughts without judgment… it sounds great in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="581" data-end="719"&gt;But if you’ve ever tried to meditate with a racing mind, you know the struggle. Sometimes, stillness actually makes your anxiety louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="721" data-end="947"&gt;The truth is, mindfulness isn’t for everyone. Some of us need movement, texture, and engagement to calm our minds. And psychologists are increasingly recognizing that anxiety relief often comes from &lt;em data-start="920" data-end="927"&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;—not just &lt;em data-start="937" data-end="945"&gt;being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="949" data-end="1144"&gt;That’s where these “weirdly specific” hobbies come in. They don’t just distract you; they regulate your nervous system in ways that mirror mindfulness—but often feel more natural and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1146" data-end="1286"&gt;So, if sitting in silence isn’t your thing, here are eight activities that can ground you just as deeply (and sometimes more effectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1293" data-end="1308"&gt;1) Pottery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1310" data-end="1501"&gt;There’s something deeply grounding about working with clay. It’s sensory, messy, and fully in the moment—everything mindfulness &lt;em data-start="1438" data-end="1445"&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to be, but without the pressure to “clear your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1503" data-end="1801"&gt;Dr. Cathy Malchiodi, a psychologist and expressive arts therapist, explains that tactile art forms like pottery help &lt;a href="https://www.cathymalchiodi.com/resources/expressive-art-therapy-articles-links?.com"&gt;discharge emotional tension&lt;/a&gt; through the body. The rhythmic motion of shaping and smoothing activates the parasympathetic nervous system—the part responsible for rest and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1803" data-end="1999"&gt;When your hands are busy centering clay on a wheel, your brain naturally settles into a calm, focused rhythm. You’re not &lt;em data-start="1924" data-end="1934"&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; your way out of anxiety; you’re &lt;em data-start="1967" data-end="1976"&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; your way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2001" data-end="2294"&gt;I took a pottery class a few years back after a stressful job transition. I wasn’t great at it—half my bowls collapsed like deflated soufflés—but I didn’t care. My mind was quiet for the first time in months. There’s something humbling about creating something imperfect with your own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2296" data-end="2464"&gt;That’s the secret: pottery teaches you to release control and embrace imperfection. You don’t need to make something beautiful—you just need to make something &lt;em data-start="2455" data-end="2462"&gt;real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2471" data-end="2487"&gt;2) Foraging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2489" data-end="2550"&gt;Foraging is part mindfulness, part adventure, part therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2552" data-end="2781"&gt;When you’re wandering through the woods searching for edible mushrooms or wild herbs, your mind can’t afford to spiral. It’s fully absorbed in observation—the color of a cap, the smell of damp soil, the sound of birds overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2783" data-end="3036"&gt;Psychologists refer to this as &lt;a href="https://positivepsychology.com/attention-restoration-theory/?.com"&gt;attention restoration theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-start="2814" data-end="2845"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It suggests that time spent in natural, lightly engaging environments helps your prefrontal cortex recover from overstimulation. In plain English: nature resets your brain’s stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3038" data-end="3182"&gt;There’s also something primal and grounding about foraging—it reconnects you to a sense of agency and survival that modern life tends to dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3184" data-end="3531"&gt;I joined a local foraging group last spring. I’ll be honest, I was mostly in it for the excuse to get outside and meet people. But after a few hikes, I noticed something unexpected: I was sleeping better, thinking clearer, and feeling calmer during the week. My therapist later said, “That’s your nervous system responding to rhythm and nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3533" data-end="3619"&gt;Turns out, you don’t have to meditate under a tree—you just have to walk among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3626" data-end="3646"&gt;3) Birdwatching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3648" data-end="3809"&gt;Birdwatching might sound like a hobby for retirees with binoculars and floppy hats—but it’s quietly one of the most effective anti-anxiety practices out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3811" data-end="4067"&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;em data-start="189" data-end="209"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/10/221027093319.htm?.com"&gt;seeing or hearing birds&lt;/a&gt; was associated with noticeable boosts in mental well-being lasting up to eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4069" data-end="4305"&gt;Here’s why: birding trains your brain to shift from rumination to observation. Instead of looping on anxious thoughts, you’re scanning for movement, listening for calls, noticing details. It’s mindfulness that comes with a soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4307" data-end="4490"&gt;There’s also a subtle joy in delayed gratification. You wait, you watch, and suddenly—there it is. A flash of red, a flutter of wings, a moment that pulls you entirely into the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4492" data-end="4701"&gt;A friend of mine started birdwatching after her therapist suggested it for social anxiety. She said, “It’s the first time I can stand in silence and not feel awkward.” That line has stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4708" data-end="4730"&gt;4) Jigsaw puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4732" data-end="4837"&gt;Mindfulness tells you to “focus on one thing at a time.” Jigsaw puzzles make that happen automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4839" data-end="5165"&gt;The repetitive motion of sorting pieces and fitting them together triggers a state psychologists call “flow”—the same deep focus artists and athletes experience when they’re completely immersed in an activity. In this state, your brain releases dopamine, which improves mood and concentration while lowering stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5167" data-end="5443"&gt;A longitudinal trial called PACE (Jigsaw Puzzles As Cognitive Enrichment) showed that solving jigsaw puzzles strongly &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00299/full?.com"&gt;engages a variety of cognitive skills&lt;/a&gt; (spatial perception, mental rotation, working memory, flexibility, reasoning) and is correlated with better visuospatial cognition—especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5445" data-end="5648"&gt;During lockdown, I rediscovered puzzles as a way to decompress. What started as “something to do” became my evening ritual. I noticed I was calmer, sleeping better, and far less tempted to doom-scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5650" data-end="5852"&gt;There’s a sense of progress in puzzles that’s hard to find in daily life. Piece by piece, you remind yourself that order can emerge from chaos—and that’s a comforting metaphor for anyone with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5859" data-end="5876"&gt;5) Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5878" data-end="6004"&gt;As someone who spends her weekends elbow-deep in soil, I can say with confidence: gardening is therapy disguised as a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6006" data-end="6146"&gt;You dig, plant, water, prune. You get sun on your face and dirt under your nails. It’s tactile and sensory—two things anxious minds crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6148" data-end="6403"&gt;Researchers at the University of Florida found that gardening activities &lt;a href="https://biotech.ufl.edu/gardening-can-cultivate-better-mental-health/?.com"&gt;significantly reduced stress&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and depression in participants, even for healthy people who’d never gardened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6405" data-end="6641"&gt;And here’s the fun part: soil contains &lt;em data-start="6444" data-end="6466"&gt;Mycobacterium vaccae&lt;/em&gt;, a natural microbe shown to boost serotonin levels—the same neurotransmitter targeted by antidepressants. So, yes, you can literally cultivate happiness from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6643" data-end="6935"&gt;One of my favorite moments each week is checking on my tomato plants at sunrise. The stillness, the smell of earth, the faint sound of bees—everything slows down. It’s not about productivity or results. It’s about remembering you’re part of something bigger and steadier than your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6942" data-end="6963"&gt;6) Improv comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6965" data-end="7112"&gt;At first glance, improv sounds like the last thing someone with anxiety should do. Standing in front of strangers with no script? Nightmare fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7114" data-end="7321"&gt;But psychologists are starting to use improv principles in therapy for exactly that reason. It’s controlled unpredictability. You learn to adapt, think on your feet, and—most importantly—laugh at yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7523" data-end="7757"&gt;Every time you say “yes, and…” you’re reinforcing flexibility and presence. There’s no time to overthink. You have to respond instinctively, which trains your brain to handle anxiety-provoking situations with humor instead of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7759" data-end="8024"&gt;I tried an improv class once at a friend’s urging. I was nervous beyond belief, but halfway through, something shifted. Everyone was laughing at themselves, failing cheerfully, and cheering each other on. It was liberating. I left lighter than I’d felt in months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8026" data-end="8132"&gt;It reminded me that joy isn’t the absence of anxiety—it’s the ability to hold it loosely and still play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8139" data-end="8161"&gt;7) Model building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8163" data-end="8301"&gt;Whether it’s assembling a miniature train set, crafting tiny houses, or designing scale models, this hobby has a strangely calming pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8303" data-end="8592"&gt;Model building demands attention to detail, but not perfection. You measure, glue, paint, and adjust, entering what psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi famously called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29?.com"&gt;“the flow state.”&lt;/a&gt; In this zone, time blurs, and your sense of self quiets down—a physiological parallel to meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8594" data-end="8795"&gt;For people with anxiety, this kind of structured engagement provides safety and predictability. You control small, manageable outcomes, which helps restore a sense of mastery when life feels chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8797" data-end="9102"&gt;A retired engineer once told me that model shipbuilding “stills the noise.” I didn’t get it until I tried building a wooden miniature greenhouse last winter. The process was slow, precise, and oddly absorbing. When I finally snapped the roof into place, I felt a calm I hadn’t realized I’d been missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9104" data-end="9189"&gt;Sometimes what we need isn’t less stimulation—it’s the &lt;em data-start="9159" data-end="9171"&gt;right kind&lt;/em&gt; of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9196" data-end="9217"&gt;8) Trail running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9219" data-end="9342"&gt;I might be biased here—I’ve been a trail runner for years—but it’s the single most reliable thing I’ve found for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9344" data-end="9560"&gt;Unlike road running, trail running forces full-body awareness. You’re scanning roots, adjusting pace, balancing on uneven terrain. There’s no space for mental chatter because your brain is busy keeping you upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9562" data-end="9881"&gt;Psychologists call this embodied mindfulness — a form of movement-based presence. In fact, a systematic review of rhythmic physical activity (dance, walking, etc.) showed &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/22/7084?.com"&gt;meaningful reductions in anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improvements in quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9883" data-end="10066"&gt;I’ve had moments mid-run where I feel so in sync with my body and surroundings that everything else fades away—the deadlines, the worries, the what-ifs. Just breath, ground, rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10068" data-end="10190"&gt;And honestly, that’s what mindfulness aims for anyway: the freedom of presence. Trail running just gets me there faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="10197" data-end="10216"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10218" data-end="10381"&gt;Here’s the truth: mindfulness isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. For some of us, the quiet feels claustrophobic. For others, the stillness invites overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10383" data-end="10475"&gt;But that doesn’t mean we can’t experience its benefits—we just need different doorways in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10477" data-end="10677"&gt;Pottery, puzzles, foraging, gardening, even improv—they’re all mindfulness in disguise. They give your hands something to do, your senses something to engage with, and your mind a break from itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10679" data-end="10783"&gt;If sitting in silence doesn’t soothe you, stop forcing it. There’s no single “right” way to find calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10785" data-end="10913"&gt;Because sometimes the best way to quiet the mind is to give it something joyful to do—something beautifully, weirdly specific.&lt;/p&gt;

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) – the wide umbrella of heart diseases, heart attack is a part of – are the leading cause of death globally. In fact, a 2025 American Heart Association report, which uses global data, estimates that the global prevalence of CVD was 612.06 million in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: Heart attacks don’t always strike with sudden, dramatic chest pain. Often, your body sends quiet, everyday signals, well before a heart crisis hits. In fact, a recent American Heart Association guide lists key symptoms like chest discomfort, upper-body pain, breathlessness, cold sweating, nausea, rapid heartbeat, and lightheadedness – symptoms that may appear gradually or without the classic chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has revealed that nearly 99% of heart attacks, strokes, or major cardiovascular events that occur in people who already had warning signs – often silent, untreated, or dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “red flags” show up years before a crisis, which means that most incidents are not sudden or unpredictable but build up over time. In other words, almost no one’s cardiovascular event is truly “out of the blue.” Researchers found that virtually all patients showed early red flags – particularly 4 warning signs – years before their first major incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我每天吃鸡蛋2周—这是我感觉到的最大变化- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/ate-eggs-every-day-2-102300851.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;I Ate Eggs Every Day for 2 Weeks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Thai Liang Lim - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much of a breakfast person — I don’t like to eat too soon after waking up, and I haven’t been a huge fan of traditional breakfast foods, like eggs. I was also a vegan until a year and a half ago, when I learned I had a vitamin &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6543499/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:B12 deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;B12 deficiency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I was unusually tired and had tingling in my hands and feet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried giving myself B12 shots, but that wasn’t for me, so I started changing my diet a little bit. That has included the occasional egg (now, I eat fish and meat sometimes, too). Although I’ve learned to like eggs, I don’t typically eat them every day. So when my editor asked me to try a daily egg for two weeks, I thought it would be a fun experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK615377/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27% of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;27% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; eat eggs on their own, in an omelette, or as part of a sandwich. Over the course of a year, it's estimated that we each eat &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183678/per-capita-consumption-of-eggs-in-the-us-since-2000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 280 eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;more than 280 eggs&lt;/a&gt;. That's good news because experts say eggs are incredibly good for you when they're part of a balanced diet: “Despite being small, they deliver a powerful nutrient package,” says &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/overviewcoph/faculty/lywright" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauri Wright;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lauri Wright&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., R.D.N., director of nutrition programs and associate professor at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs are often called ‘nature’s multivitamin’ for good reason,” she says. “They’re packed with high-quality protein, which supports muscle repair and satiety, and they contain nutrients many people fall short on, like vitamin D, choline, and lutein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is it healthy to eat them every day? And what happens to your body when you eat an egg every day? I was intrigued to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Egg nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/748967/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:egg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;egg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 71&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total fat: 5 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 6.24 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12: 0.5 mcg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D: 1.24 mcg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium: 24 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline: 169 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the health benefits of eating eggs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, eggs got a bad rap. That’s mostly because they contain saturated fat and cholesterol, and people worried about their health effects. However, recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11161868/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have debunked the myth that eggs are linked to cardiovascular disease and eggs now appear to be neutral or slightly beneficial for lipid profiles in most healthy adults. “The old philosophy that eggs raise cholesterol has been found to be outdated,” Berjis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the main nutrient benefits of eggs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Eggs are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64853473/how-much-protein-do-we-need/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, which can slow digestion and curb cravings, Wright says. “Over time, that can help with appetite regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D:&lt;/strong&gt; Eggs are one of just a few foods that naturally contain &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vitamin D&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you absorb calcium. The vitamin is essential for bone health, mental health, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choline:&lt;/strong&gt; This is “great for brain health,” Berjis says. &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-Consumer/#:~:text=professional" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Choline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Choline&lt;/a&gt; also supports your nervous system and cell health. Most adults do not meet the recommended intake for choline, making eggs a convenient way to help reach targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B12:&lt;/strong&gt; Two eggs give you a third of your necessary &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;B12&lt;/a&gt; for the day, Wright says. The vitamin is “essential for making red blood cells, keeping nerves healthy, and supporting energy metabolism,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antioxidants: &lt;/strong&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4632414/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; lutein and zeaxanthin support eye health, Berjis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;AlexPro9500 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I ate eggs every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting off, I made egg bites packed with spinach and other vegetables. I’d made them before and knew they freeze well, so I thought it would be convenient to have these on hand for when I felt too lazy to cook. &lt;strong&gt;I ate the egg bites a few times over the two-week period, usually with a slice of whole-wheat toast or a whole-wheat frozen waffle. This was a very filling combo—I never felt snacky until the next mealtime. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for a couple of other meals I enjoyed: arugula salad with a hard-boiled egg and scrambled eggs with toast. This kept me full for hours. On other days, I ate a hard-boiled egg or two as a snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with feeling fuller after meals and snacks, I seemed to have more energy. &lt;strong&gt;I noticed that I stopped reaching for my usual afternoon coffee. Experts say this is common when you eat eggs. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people notice they stay fuller for longer thanks to the protein and healthy fats,” says &lt;a href="https://innerhealthwellness.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sahar Berjis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sahar Berjis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, R.D., a registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="https://innerhealthwellness.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inner Health and Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Inner Health and Wellness&lt;/a&gt;. “Some report more steady energy throughout the day.” The stabilized energy is likely due to the B vitamins, as well as choline, which is crucial for mood, memory, and brain and nervous system function, Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it a good idea to eat eggs every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the idea of eating eggs every day,” says Berjis, who recommends choosing organic and cage-free eggs. “For most healthy individuals, eggs can absolutely be part of a daily routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One egg per day is a “solid guideline for the general population,” Wright says. Two a day may be recommended for older people, active individuals, and those with higher protein needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but one's risk of heart disease should be considered as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating more than that occasionally isn’t harmful for most, but consistently eating four or more a day may not be ideal for those with diabetes, high cholesterol, or a family history of heart disease,” she explains. Most recent guidelines do not strictly limit egg intake for these groups, but individual context matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don’t rely on eggs alone as your only protein source. Wright suggests balancing your intake with other proteins, such as fish, beans, or nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may notice bloating and stomach discomfort when they eat eggs too frequently, which could be a sign of an egg sensitivity, Berjis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond health, Berjis says eggs are “quick, budget-friendly, and incredibly versatile.” She says she loves a “veggie-packed scramble” — eggs with sautéed spinach, tomatoes, and onions, and topped with avocado. “It’s fast, colorful, and makes you feel like you’ve already checked the ‘eat your veggies’ box by breakfast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating veggies adds “extra fiber, vitamins, and minerals to the protein-rich base of eggs,” says Wright, who also recommends snacking on hard-boiled eggs sprinkled with everything-bagel seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other easy ways to incorporate eggs include tossing them into salads, whipping up a frittata, or simply scrambling them, she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I enjoyed eating eggs daily and felt that pairing them with whole grains and greens made me feel fuller and more energetic.&lt;/strong&gt; However, I did get a little sick of eggs by the end of the two weeks. While I do plan to incorporate them into my routine, I’m not sure I’ll stick to eating an egg a day. However, dietitians do say eating eggs daily is a healthy option that offers protein and other essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 12:46:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5yamRLel9pTnBhYktPUGJGdXpFdXlSOFlORVlhWFVxTHV4UEdsbUJhd2VXYWZDMk1kLWdpajBrZVp6TE90QUNURkRsdkhONE1MVEZ6ejJlV0RfOGZEMHlvalhUQmowZw</guid></item><item><title>她的分娩是正常的，然后她的心脏停止了跳动。新妈妈在罕见并发症后康复的斗争- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amniotic-fluid-embolism-birth-delivery-labor-university-of-maryland-baltimore/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Choate's pregnancy was uncomplicated — until it wasn't. Two and a half weeks before her March 6, 2025 due date, the 27-year-old went to the emergency room at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center after experiencing headaches and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors thought Choate might be suffering from preeclampsia and induced labor. Her fiancée rushed to her side. Choate chatted with him and her care team as her labor progressed normally. Suddenly, she was struck with an excruciating pressure in her chest and head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was not painful but it felt like someone was squeezing me as hard as they possibly could. I felt like my head was going to explode," Choate said. She turned to Arianna Bortle, the labor and delivery nurse at her side. "I said, 'Something has gone wrong. I don't feel good.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bortle had only been a nurse for 18 months but Choate's statements made her hair stand on end. She immediately ran to get her superiors. As they re-entered the room, Choate's heart stopped.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was talking to me, and then she wasn't," Bortle said. "She didn't have a pulse." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an amniotic fluid embolism? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Choate had experienced was an amniotic fluid embolism, doctors said. The condition is a "super rare obstetric event" when amniotic fluid enters a person's bloodstream and "sets off a cascade of events" that causes "essentially all major organs of the mom's body to shut down," said Dr. Nicole Scott, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics &amp;amp; gynecology at Indiana University's School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors don't know what causes the "life-threatening event," Scott said. It occurs in about 1 in 40,000 U.S. births, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15463-amniotic-fluid-embolism" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They usually happen shortly after a person's water breaks, and have no warning signs, Scott said. Patients quickly decompensate, with the heart failing and other organs shutting down. The body's clotting process malfunctions, causing intense bleeding. People may experience strokes and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/mom-survives-rare-amniotic-fluid-embolism-while-giving-birth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the women who have an amniotic fluid embolism die, according to Scott. The mortality rate for their babies varies depending on the stage of labor a person is in when the embolism occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors usually suffer lifelong complications, according to Scott. A lack of blood to the brain may leave a patient with long-lasting neurological issues, and blood clots can cause musculoskeletal issues. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/amniotic-fluid-embolism-annie-sterle/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Some people are paralyzed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A fight to recover &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choate was resuscitated, and her daughter was successfully delivered via cesarean section. Doctors used blood transfusions, clamps and a uterine tamponade to control Choate's blood loss and stabilize her, said Dr. Pablo Argeles, the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at UM BWMC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals from multiple disciplines collaborated on how to keep Choate alive, Argeles said. She was placed on a ventilator and transferred to the University of Maryland Medical Center for advanced intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Choate woke up, she had no idea what had happened or where her baby was. She assumed the worst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like, 'If I have a tube in my throat, there's no way she survived whatever happened ... there's no way that a baby that is measuring 7 or 8 pounds is alive right now,'" Choate said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an agonizing wait, Choate was told that her baby was alive and well. After a doctor explained what had happened, Choate understood that she was lucky: Both she and her daughter had survived, and she would not have long-term medical complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Choate recovered, she was haunted by her ordeal. She Googled amniotic fluid embolisms and said she was horrified by the statistics she found. She was able to briefly see her baby but was distraught about missing so much time with her. Being apart hurt more than her recovery, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like, 'I need to go home. I have to go home right now. I need to be a mom,'" Choate said. "They kept telling me I was a miracle. I was like, 'I don't care about being a miracle. I want to be a mom.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As staff weaned her off medications and machines, Choate began to push herself. She practiced how she would maneuver her way into the bathtub or stand up from a couch. She wheeled her baby's bassinet around the recovery floor to show she was ready to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was hard. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. It was painful, and I was crying. I was in so much pain. But when you have a baby, all of that pain just gets pushed to the side. My pain level was 1000 over 10, and I did not care," Choate said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The display worked. Choate was discharged after nine days in the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The one most important thing" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Choate arrived home, the house was covered in so many cards, posters and baby gifts that she could barely recognize it. Her family offered support. Bortle, the nurse who realized something was wrong, came to visit. Her daughter, now seven months old, is on her best behavior, Choate joked, and practicing skills like rolling and sitting up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She doesn't cry about literally anything. I say 'She knows what I've been through, so she's taking it easy," Choate teased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as life continues on, Choate said she thinks about her ordeal "every single day." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never taken my life for granted, but it is scary to think that anything can happen," Choate said. "Sometimes I wonder, like, did this actually happen to me? I almost feel like I'm living in a different universe." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-54527-001?doi=1" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, indicate that emotional reactions may play a central role in driving ideological extremity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to better understand what might fuel increasingly polarized and extreme political attitudes in the United States. While disagreement and debate are foundational to democratic systems, the political landscape has become more divided in recent years, with a growing number of Americans identifying with viewpoints further from the political center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has pointed to several contributors to this trend, including psychological tendencies like intolerance of uncertainty or a preference for black-and-white thinking. But many scholars have also proposed that emotion—especially negative emotion such as fear or anger—plays a powerful role. Emotional reactions can shape how people interpret news, view political opponents, and form alliances. In this study, the researchers asked whether people on the far left and far right not only hold strong beliefs but also experience political information in similarly emotional ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also aimed to test a concept sometimes referred to as the “horseshoe theory,” which suggests that political extremes may resemble each other more than they do moderates. If true, then individuals on opposite ideological ends could be more psychologically alike than different, at least in how they respond to political content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research was inspired by the growing political polarization and ideological extremism observed around us. Recent political crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Israel and Gaza have intensified extreme views across both ends of the political spectrum, which motivated us to look beyond left-right differences,” said study author Daantje de Bruin, a PhD student at Brown University and member of &lt;a href="https://www.feldmanhalllab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the FeldmanHall lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, we asked whether there might be common neurophysiological mechanisms underlying political extremism, regardless of ideological content. This idea aligns with the ‘horseshoe theory’ of politics, which suggests that the far left and far right, despite opposing beliefs, often resemble each other in psychological and behavioral ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the team recruited 44 participants from across the political spectrum, with a particular focus on those at the ideological extremes. Participants were identified based on how far they leaned from the political center on a 100-point scale, ranging from extremely liberal to extremely conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants watched a politically charged segment of the 2016 vice-presidential debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence while undergoing brain scans in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. At the same time, the researchers recorded physiological responses—specifically, galvanic skin conductance, which measures emotional arousal through changes in sweat gland activity. Eye-tracking was also used to assess where participants focused their attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the brain imaging data revealed a consistent pattern: participants with stronger political beliefs, regardless of whether they were liberal or conservative, showed increased activity in brain areas associated with emotion and threat detection. These included the amygdala, known for processing fear; the periaqueductal gray, which is involved in defensive behaviors; and the posterior superior temporal sulcus, a region linked to interpreting social cues and understanding others’ intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings were in line with our hypothesis that holding extreme views (regardless of the content of those views) means that individuals share, at least on some dimensions, similar processing of the world around them,” de Bruin told PsyPost. “This helps explain how the language or actions of die-hard liberals or conservatives can appear eerily similar to the language and actions of those on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that extreme political views may be tied to stronger emotional reactions to political material. In other words, the more ideologically extreme a person was, the more emotionally charged their brain response appeared to be when watching political content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed how similarly participants’ brains responded to the debate. By comparing moment-to-moment brain activity across pairs of participants, they found that those who both held extreme views—even if one was very liberal and the other very conservative—showed more synchronized brain responses than moderates did. This synchronization was especially pronounced in areas of the brain involved in understanding others’ perspectives and emotions, such as the temporoparietal junction and adjacent regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this effect was not merely the result of shared ideology. Participants with very different political beliefs still showed similar patterns of brain activity if both were high in extremity. This provides evidence that the way people process political content may be shaped more by the intensity of their beliefs than by the direction of those beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another layer of the study looked at the role of language. The researchers used a machine learning tool to evaluate the level of extreme language in the debate video. They found that parts of the video containing more extreme or provocative language tended to strengthen the brain synchrony effect among extreme individuals. In other words, the most emotionally intense parts of the political content seemed to draw extreme viewers into an even more aligned neurological state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers examined physiological arousal. While they did not find that more extreme individuals had higher average arousal levels overall, they did find that shared physiological responses between pairs—specifically synchronized spikes in skin conductance—correlated with greater neural synchrony. This relationship held especially true for participants with the most extreme beliefs. In other words, when extreme individuals not only shared strong views but also experienced similar emotional reactions in their bodies, their brains tended to process political content in more closely aligned ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that people with more extreme political views, on either end of the political spectrum, show stronger brain responses to the political content in areas involved in emotions, such as fear, threat detection, and understanding the perspective of others,” de Bruin explained. “We also find that more extreme individuals, regardless of their political ideology, show more similar neural responses to political content.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite stark differences in political beliefs, extreme individuals on opposite sides of the political spectrum thus process political content in similar ways, providing neurophysiological support for the horseshoe theory of politics. This suggests that ideological opposites may be more alike in how they process politics than they realize. Recognizing this shared experience could foster greater empathy and reduce dehumanization across the political divide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides evidence that emotion plays a central role in shaping how people with extreme beliefs experience political content, but it also comes with some limitations. First, the political material used covered only a narrow set of topics, specifically immigration and policing. It is not clear whether similar results would emerge with different political subjects or more recent content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the research was conducted entirely within the United States and may not generalize to other countries or political systems. Cultures with different norms, levels of polarization, or media environments might show different patterns of emotional and neurological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study provides new insight into how emotion and social perception influence political extremity. The fact that people with opposing ideologies can show similar patterns of brain activity suggests that emotional experience may be a shared thread connecting those on both sides of the political divide. Recognizing this shared experience might help reduce hostility and open the door to more understanding, even in a time of rising polarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the theorized link between extremism and affective processing, highlighting the importance of understanding polarization and radicalization as not just a cognitive or ideological process, but also one that considers emotion,” de Bruin said. “In future work, we aim to further investigate how affective processing might be altered in more extreme individuals, and why their responses may differ from moderates. Ultimately, we aim to use these insights to inform approaches that reduce polarization and help people engage with political information more thoughtfully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-54527-001?doi=1" target="_blank"&gt;Politically Extreme Individuals Exhibit Similar Neural Processing Despite Ideological Differences&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daantje de Bruin and Oriel FeldmanHall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 10:03:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPVjhYUmFZZUl0NXMyZ0JQcjc2dmdWOTVTa3NqbTVuaTJNYkN0VExfT012akhLWGtFcUV6MzlfWTFOQUFYbkhlMW9YRC05ak84U3dlSFlHSkJtTGVhZEdNWXMxanNPVmRvYUVlUDA5a3hVTXBBaHhxT3pQNmVhYVhyVXdWSXZZdk13bTZkR2tVNUlSclF1ekdCeFJjVzY4bV9SRGNJZHJJOA</guid></item><item><title>新的阿尔茨海默氏症治疗和研究正在激发人们的希望-《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/11/metro/alzheimers-treatments-lithium/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

The drug Aduhelm, which could slightly slow the progress of Alzheimer’s but had major risks, was &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/31/business/biogen-adhuhlem-fda-lequembi/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;pulled off the market&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 after skeptical doctors shunned it and insurers and Medicare restricted coverage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The enthusiasm is also tempered by fears that reductions in federal research funding could stall the most promising work. President Trump has asked Congress to cut the National Institutes of Health budget by 40 percent. But appropriations committees in both the Senate and the House &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.alz.org/news/2025/house-appropriations-committee-15-million-increase-alzheimers-research__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!KfxNhNa3CQq5idGt7H_0MbjPlKtE5APzJ4buNlYhqNfXZ38a4czGJj0wkKp5FK1U9m0ozkx8ZXl-TTrp0Q08c54$" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;have voted to increase&lt;/a&gt; funding for Alzheimer’s research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“As we’re making this progress, we cannot back up,” Antkowiak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The current leading hypothesis is that Alzheimer’s disease is driven by two types of malformed proteins — amyloid plaques and tau tangles — which interfere with brain function, gradually diminishing the ability to think and remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Tau helps the neurons in healthy brains function. But it becomes a problem when it twists into sticky tangles that accumulate in the brain. How tau and amyloid interact is not fully understood, but tau tangles seem to play a greater role in imminent cognitive decline, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the Center for Alzheimer’s Research and Treatment at Mass General Brigham and a leader of the AHEAD study that Rick is participating in. When tau tangles start spreading, it “almost always occurs in the setting of pretty high amyloid,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Participants in the AHEAD study receive infusions of Leqembi (lecanemab), one of two drugs that have been approved to treat people who already have symptoms. Leqembi and the other drug, Kisunla (donanemab), remove amyloid and slow the illness, but do not stop it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.eisai.com/news/2025/news202554.html__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!Nbg8etTEA7UXfqbxewlRMjs7_8ObNJcDixLNIvEofWHZ6TbsPo9Vrn_MDembfrLVyhxXusKufzvFN027r0DB2w$" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; showed that many symptomatic participants who had low levels of malformed tau when they started taking Leqembi either got better or maintained the same level of function after four years.

They require trips to the hospital, or a visit from a home nurse, to get infusions, although &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pharmatimes.com/news/fda-approves-leqembi-iqlik-for-maintenance-dosing-in-early-alzheimers-disease/__;!!BspMT6SJLSDJ!KfxNhNa3CQq5idGt7H_0MbjPlKtE5APzJ4buNlYhqNfXZ38a4czGJj0wkKp5FK1U9m0ozkx8ZXl-TTrp-Q1hHbI$" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a new injectable version&lt;/a&gt; that can be self-administered may soon be available.

Rudolph E. Tanzi, director of Mass. General’s Henry and Allison McCance Center for Brain Health, said this drug, known as GSM, for gamma secretase modulator, would come in the form of a pill and would be less expensive. He hopes to start testing its safety in humans in the fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If it’s proven safe and effective, Tanzi envisions GSM someday being offered to people at risk of Alzheimer’s in the same way statins are prescribed for people at risk of heart disease. “We’re going to nip it in the bud,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;All told, said Antkowiak, of the Alzheimer’s Association, more than 140 unique therapies are being tested in clinical trials, targeting amyloid and tau but also inflammation and the health of blood vessels — all believed to be involved in the development of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/metro/alzheimers-treatment-harvard-lithium-deficiency-plaques/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;One study published in August&lt;/a&gt; stirred excitement when it showed that the metal &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/metro/alzheimers-treatment-harvard-lithium-deficiency-plaques/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;lithium, used to treat psychiatric illnesses&lt;/a&gt;, plays a role in brain function and might protect against Alzheimer’s. The study found lithium was depleted in the brains of people in the earliest stages of memory loss during aging, as amyloid began forming. Amyloid bound to the lithium, apparently depriving cells of its protective function. The study also found that feeding tiny amounts of lithium to mice with signs of dementia restored their memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But those who are worried about Alzheimer’s don’t need to wait for new drugs to improve their prospects. Ample and growing evidence shows that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing dementia.

Like CAR-T cells, these modified immune cells can be programmed to recognize and attack cancer, but they rely on a different type of immune cell that naturally targets abnormal or infected cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A team from MIT and Harvard Medical School has now developed a more effective way to engineer CAR-NK cells that dramatically reduces the chance of the body’s immune system rejecting them. Immune rejection has been one of the biggest limitations of cell-based therapies, often weakening their effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This innovation could also make it possible to produce “off-the-shelf” CAR-NK treatments that are available immediately after diagnosis, rather than waiting weeks for custom-engineered cells. Traditional CAR-NK and CAR-T manufacturing methods typically require several weeks to complete before patients can begin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This enables us to do one-step engineering of CAR-NK cells that can avoid rejection by host T cells and other immune cells. And, they kill cancer cells better and they’re safer,” says Jianzhu Chen, an MIT professor of biology, a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and one of the senior authors of the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests using mice with humanized immune systems, the newly engineered cells successfully destroyed most cancer cells while avoiding attack from the host’s own immune defenses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rizwan Romee, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is also a senior author of the paper, which was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. The study’s lead author is Fuguo Liu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Koch Institute and a research fellow at Dana-Farber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evading the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural killer (NK) cells are a vital part of the body’s built-in immune defense, responsible for identifying and destroying cancerous and virus-infected cells. They eliminate these threats through a process called degranulation, which releases a protein known as perforin. This protein punctures the membrane of target cells, leading to their death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To produce CAR-NK cells for treatment, doctors typically collect a blood sample from the patient. NK cells are then extracted and engineered to express a specialized protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which is designed to target specific markers found on cancer cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once modified, the cells must multiply in the lab for several weeks before there are enough to be infused back into the patient. The same general process is used for CAR-T cell therapies, some of which have already been approved to treat blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia. CAR-NK therapies, however, are still being tested in clinical trials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because growing enough personalized CAR-NK cells takes time and the patient’s cells may not always be healthy enough for reliable use, scientists have been exploring an alternative: creating NK cells from healthy donors. These donor-derived cells could be mass-produced and stored for rapid use. The challenge, however, is that the recipient’s immune system often identifies donor cells as foreign and destroys them before they can attack the cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their latest research, the MIT team aimed to solve this problem by helping NK cells “hide” from immune detection. Their experiments showed that removing surface proteins known as HLA class 1 molecules allowed NK cells to avoid attack from T cells in the host’s immune system. These proteins normally act as identity markers that tell the immune system whether a cell belongs to the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make use of this insight, the researchers added a sequence of siRNA (short interfering RNA) that silences the genes responsible for producing HLA class 1 proteins. Along with this genetic tweak, they introduced the CAR gene itself and another gene that encodes either PD-L1 or single-chain HLA-E (SCE), both of which help strengthen the NK cells’ cancer-fighting abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of these genetic components were combined into a single DNA construct, which allowed the team to efficiently convert donor NK cells into immune-evasive CAR-NK cells. Using this method, they engineered cells that target CD-19, a protein commonly found on malignant B cells in lymphoma patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NK cells unleashed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested these CAR-NK cells in mice with a human-like immune system. These mice were also injected with lymphoma cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that received CAR-NK cells with the new construct maintained the NK cell population for at least three weeks, and the NK cells were able to nearly eliminate cancer in those mice. In mice that received either NK cells with no genetic modifications or NK cells with only the CAR gene, the host immune cells attacked the donor NK cells. In these mice, the NK cells died out within two weeks, and the cancer spread unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that these engineered CAR-NK cells were much less likely to induce cytokine release syndrome — a common side effect of immunotherapy treatments, which can cause life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of CAR-NK cells’ potentially better safety profile, Chen anticipates that they could eventually be used in place of CAR-T cells. For any CAR-NK cells that are now in development to target lymphoma or other types of cancer, it should be possible to adapt them by adding the construct developed in this study, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers now hope to run a clinical trial of this approach, working with colleagues at Dana-Farber. They are also working with a local biotech company to test CAR-NK cells to treat lupus, an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack healthy tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;

I asked two doctors whose answers had a surprising amount in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ditch the idea of short-term immune “boosts” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to HuffPost UK,&lt;a href="https://onlinedoctor.asda.com/uk/dr-crystal-wyllie.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" Dr Crystal Wyllie at Asda Online Doctor" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e393aae4b0b59bd0ef0326" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://onlinedoctor.asda.com/uk/dr-crystal-wyllie.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt; Dr Crystal Wyllie at Asda Online Doctor&lt;/a&gt; said there’s no one-stop, quick-fix way to “supercharge” your immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://click2pharmacy.co.uk/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr Hussain Ahmad" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e393aae4b0b59bd0ef0326" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://click2pharmacy.co.uk/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr Hussain Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;, a hospital doctor, said: “I don’t really like the word boost when we talk about the immune system. It gives the idea that you can switch it on or make it stronger with tablets or drinks, but that’s not how it works... taking lots of vitamin C or other supplements doesn’t make it work any better for most people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Dr Wyllie said: “The easiest way to help boost your immune system is to choose a healthy lifestyle. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet high in fruit and vegetables, and exercising regularly are all natural steps you can take to help your immune system function normally.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, though all doctors recommended doing what Dr Ahmad called “simple stuff” over a long period of time, Dr Wyllie said that some changes really can make a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Quitting smoking is hugely beneficial for your overall health, but also helps the health of your immune system,” she revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s partly because “your adaptive immune system, the part responsible for remembering and responding to threats, can be negatively impacted by smoking,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can take years for your immune system to recover after quitting smoking, so the sooner you decide to stop, the better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you might be surprised by how much changing your pace of life helps. “Stress and tiredness can make you more likely to catch things, so slowing down when you can really helps,” Dr Ahmad advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any genuine “immune boosts”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes(ish). There is one exception to the “slow-burn, lifestyle change” rule: vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “are the only proven ways to prepare your immune system for specific infections,” Dr Ahmad advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr Wyllie shared “It is much safer and easier for your immune system to build its defences through vaccinations than by catching the disease”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that nobody should take supplements or that they’re useless – this is not the case, especially if you have nutrient deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as Dr Ahmad put it, the best place for most of us to start is by trying our best to “eat proper meals with some fruit and veg in there, move your body every day, and make sure you’re getting enough rest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, along with keeping up with any vaccines we’re eligible for, is as close to an “immune system boost” as we’re likely to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost UK</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 09:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOQl9VamFkYXdobFpyQVBobGxuOUh5c2lCa21wcnpRVHBQdnJZQWt5a0pRWXFSc2phdDVrUWVQQl8zMlMtYkFFdVU1cTl4M0tlYV9lZk9zMmhZcWJDd1BiNnN6S05BZ1VjeVFXNmFTMFRRcGhPaDRVak0wTkJzbnRrSkJ0eTF6RGJrbVdubWlvRl95QXA5eEtDcFZYUVlmVjRULVpUSmt30gGsAUFVX3lxTE9uSjlDQ2w2cU96dVhoVEx4Q2FxWGUzeVJ4ZmVjTnVmcENnZElSZkdqQnFzN0NtdENXOENyMWR0ZHpJRm1GTzZBQzBidnBLTWJFUzVPRHBfcE5pUkp5M21RVlRUcUZjQWs4ZThFTzh4MzFwZWx2VzJjWHJnS1lCcnllVS03UEFYSzhoRjdkT1B1OU5hVlhKS040S1UxMTg0WkFDcDhhUzBQdzFUWnI</guid></item><item><title>专家分享了从小说中分辨肠道健康的5个技巧- Euronews.com</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/10/11/gut-health-is-all-the-rage-experts-share-5-tips-to-sort-fact-from-fiction</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-content c-article-content--health js-article-content"&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;More and more, it may seem that the answer to common health quandaries leads to a single culprit: our guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome – the ecosystem of bacteria and other tiny organisms that live in our digestive tracts – has in recent years been linked to a wide range of health issues, including &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/07/common-bacteria-found-in-the-stomach-has-no-symptoms-but-could-cause-12-million-cancers-st"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cancer,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/08/13/cant-sleep-your-gut-health-may-be-partly-to-blame-study-finds"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/09/11/how-womens-gut-health-could-affect-their-risk-of-preterm-birth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preterm birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;That’s prompted a lot of excitement among doctors and scientists seeking to improve people’s wellbeing – but in most cases, there are still more questions than answers. In the absence of strong evidence, grifters, half-baked trends, and misinformation often fill the void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euronews Health spoke with gut health experts to set the record straight. They said there’s no model for a perfectly healthy gut because our microbiomes are all unique, and changes to them aren’t necessarily bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the microbiome, it's very rare that you can give a straight, 100 per cent answer that applies to everyone, because everyone is so different. Simple stories really don't exist,” Alan Walker, a microbiologist at the University of Aberdeen, told Euronews Health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are five expert tips to sort fact from fiction when it comes to gut health.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;h2&gt;At-home tests don’t have all the answers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many diagnostic tests for gut health are sold over the counter or through expensive private laboratories, and claim they can use a stool sample to identify whether specific foods are good or bad for the buyer. The results are often presented on a scale or colour-coded from green to red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “simple indices and indicators are always very misleading,” said Dr Lucas Wauters, a gastroenterologist at University Hospitals Leuven (UZ Leuven) in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wauters told Euronews Health that these tests often have some basis in science, focusing on things such as food intolerance or leaky gut, formally called intestinal permeability. Others can be genuinely useful, such as tests that look for specific bacteria in stool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Wauters said scientists are still studying these concepts in laboratory settings, so at-home tests may rely on thin evidence to make outsized health claims.&lt;/p&gt;  



&lt;p&gt;A major red flag, he said, is test results that come with recommendations for – or even links to purchase – supplements or other products that claim they will “cure” the gut malady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the claims are put too simply [or are] automatically coupled to a treatment, like a supplement or whatever, then you can call it, or be close to calling it, a scam,” Wauters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When it comes to quick fixes, buyer beware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of supplements, juices, powders, and detoxes that suggest they’ll boost gut health. Before buying, Walker recommends checking whether any of these products have been tested in people and have the evidence to back up their health claims. Most don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the proof isn't there, it doesn't mean it won't work, but it’s a leap of faith,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Probiotics are more complex than they seem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are the “good” microbes that can support certain aspects of our health, while prebiotics are parts of food that we don’t digest. Instead, they feed the beneficial bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are thought to restore the natural balance of bacteria in the gut, and are found in fermented foods such as yoghurt, kefir, cottage cheese, kimchi, and kombucha.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there are thousands of different probiotic bacteria and yeasts – so simply adding probiotic supplements or shakes to your diet may not do much for your gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker said he would like to see more rigorous research testing different types of probiotics at various doses and durations to treat specific health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, “if we're being honest and we look at the level of evidence that those things actually work, overall it's very patchy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay away from DIYs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faecal transplants – when a healthy person’s stool is placed into a patient’s colon – have shown promise to treat recurring infections with bacteria known as Clostridium difficile. That’s prompted research into whether these transplants can be used to treat other medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also led to a raft of people trying to do their own faecal transplants at home to treat everything from mental health issues to Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Walker warned that people should leave this procedure to the professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People can be harmed, and we don't understand the long-term consequences,” he said. “This should never be done outside of clinical recommendations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When in doubt, stick with the tried and true&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, a healthy, balanced diet is one of the best things we can do for our gut health, Wauters and Walker said. Drink lots of water, limit soda and alcohol consumption, and get enough fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both recommended eating foods rich in fibre, such as beans, kiwis, and oats – but they noted that people’s tolerances vary. If you experience symptoms such as bloating, gas, or constipation after &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/14/fibremaxxing-why-nutrition-experts-can-actually-get-behind-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upping your fibre intake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, try cutting down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wauters also recommended that people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gut pain get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise three to five days per week to keep their digestive system moving and relieve constipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, when it comes to more expensive or high-tech solutions, the experts urged caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's lots of promise [in gut microbiome research], but at this point in time we need better quality evidence for most interventions,” Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

It also enhances scientific understanding of depression, a condition that affects more than 264 million people globally and is one of the leading causes of disability.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've been able to identify what specific brain cell types are affected in depression by mapping gene activity together with mechanisms that regulate the DNA code," said senior author Dr. Gustavo Turecki, a professor at McGill, clinician-scientist at the Douglas Institute and Canada Research Chair in Major Depressive Disorder and Suicide. "It gives us a much clearer picture of where disruptions are happening, and which cells are involved."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare brain bank enables breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team conducted their work using post-mortem brain tissue from the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank, one of the few collections worldwide that includes donations from people with psychiatric conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through advanced single-cell genomic analysis, the researchers examined RNA and DNA from thousands of individual brain cells to determine which ones behaved differently in people with depression and which DNA sequences might explain these variations. The study analyzed tissue from 59 individuals who had depression and 41 who did not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They discovered that gene activity was altered in two types of brain cells: a class of excitatory neurons responsible for mood and stress regulation, and a subtype of microglia, the immune cells that manage inflammation in the brain. In both cell types, many genes were expressed differently in people with depression, pointing to possible disruptions in vital neural systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By identifying the specific cells affected, the research deepens understanding of the biological foundation of depression and helps dispel outdated views of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research reinforces what neuroscience has been telling us for years," Turecki said. "Depression isn't just emotional, it reflects real, measurable changes in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the scientists intend to explore how these cellular changes influence brain function and whether targeting them could lead to more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling identifies cell types and functional variants contributing to major depression" by Anjali Chawla and Gustavo Turecki et al., was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Brain Canada Foundation, Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé and Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Gene supplementation is providing a functional new copy of a defective gene, a strategy that has great potential for correcting diseases where a gene is completely missing or where a single copy of a gene is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This [study] provides a clear demonstration that SYNGAP1-related disorders can be treated with a neuron-specific gene supplementation strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is in the early stages and was only carried out in mice, with researchers saying clinical trials still need to be done in humans to confirm that the therapy works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists heralded the results as a positive step towards developing a treatment for the condition. It was particularly notable that the study was successful in juvenile mice, which is around the same age at which humans are diagnosed with SRDs and could, therefore, receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,500 Americans have been diagnosed with a SYNGAP1-related brain disorder, activists say, although estimates suggest many cases have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not all autism and epilepsy cases are caused by SYNGAP1-related disorders, although patients with SRDs may be diagnosed with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorders are considered to be a spectrum because the faulty genes often do not affect the brain in exactly the same way or to the same level of severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no specific treatment or cure for the condition, but doctors say they can help patients to manage symptoms using antiseizure medications or implanting devices into the body that can help to control nerve activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to two percent of all intellectual disability cases, including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, are estimated to be caused by SRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the therapy, a healthy copy of the faulty gene is delivered to brain cells by an adenovirus, or cold virus. It was successful at improving symptoms in juvenile mice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 31 children in the US has autism, a surge on the one in 150 estimated to have the condition in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested that about 80 percent of autism cases are linked to inherited genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Robert F Kennedy Jr, the Health and Human Services Secretary, is among those who have argued that the surge in cases cannot be blamed on genetics alone and is likely also down to unidentified environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 470,000 children in the US have epilepsy, with experts also suggesting that the condition is caused by both genetic and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epilepsy is a common symptom in patients with SYNGAP1-related brain disorders, with more than 80 percent of sufferers also diagnosed with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the research, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(25)00759-2.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001625007592%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, scientists injected the altered adenoviruses into the mice's cerebral ventricles, the fluid-filled cavities in the center of the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injection was carried out by inserting a needle past the eye and into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Boaz Levy, left, who led the research, and associate investigator Dr Rong Guo and scientist Dr Meagan Quinlan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is the cross section of the brain of a mouse in the study. The highlighted areas represent locations where the adenovirus delivered the treatment to the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to two weeks later the rodents were put through a battery of tests to measure the impact of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests included tracking the movements of mice in a 7.8inch by 7.8inch arena, to check for erratic behavior, and placing them in an elevated maze and monitoring their behavior to estimate anxiety and risk-taking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'Our findings provide the first evidence that... gene therapy can restore SYNGAP1 function and reverse key [symptoms], supporting its potential as a transformative therapeutic for patients.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After beef liver, whole eggs are the best food source of choline, which plays key roles in maintaining healthy cell membranes, regulating mood and muscle control, and fat transport and metabolism, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, of the 5 g of fat in an egg, roughly two-thirds is made up of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, the healthy types that may reduce inflammation and lower your risk of heart disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/monounsaturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; (AHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential downsides of eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaney notes that there aren’t any downsides to eating eggs, despite the fact that many potential ones have been raised in the past. Whole eggs, particularly egg yolks, have been associated with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65628846/foods-to-lower-cholesterol-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease over the years, mainly because one whole egg contains 207 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol. However, dietary cholesterol (the cholesterol found in food) and blood cholesterol (the cholesterol found in the body) are two different things. What’s more, the AHA notes that the evidence does not support an association between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular risk. So if you’ve been avoiding egg yolks because of the cholesterol, experts say there’s no need to do so. Of couse, you should consult your physician and/or a dietitian before incorporating large amounts into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, if you are a traditionalist in terms of how you enjoy your eggs, you may need to make some changes. “If the eggs are covered with cheese and served with bacon, sausages and/or ham, these all contribute saturated fat,” which does increase your heart disease risk, says Koenig. “Having your eggs scrambled with vegetables and a light dusting of cheese makes a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Egg whites benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Egg whites are a really brilliant source of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63749873/guide-to-eating-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adding lean protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adding lean protein&lt;/a&gt; to your diet. I absolutely love them and they are a firm favorite in our house!” says Delaney. “If you’re trying to increase your protein intake whilst watching your overall calorie and fat consumption, egg whites are a brilliant addition to your meals.” As noted above, one egg white delivers 4 g of protein for just 18 calories—that’s two-thirds of the protein in a whole egg, but for only a quarter of the calories—ideal for those on a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a44373604/what-is-a-low-calorie-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-calorie diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-calorie diet&lt;/a&gt; and looking to lose weight. Plus, they contain minimal fat, as almost all the fat in an egg is found in the yolk. “Egg whites are low in calories and fat, support muscle recovery, help curb your appetite, and keep you feeling fuller for longer, and they’re a really high-quality protein,” affirms Delaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential downsides of egg whites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are not necessarily any nutritional downsides to eating egg whites. Instead, the negatives come from what you’re missing out on. “By excluding the yolk, you are eliminating the concentrated nutrition found there,” says Koenig. That means you’re missing out on vitamins and minerals, choline, and antioxidants. “The yolk is the absolute powerhouse of the egg,” says Delaney. “I definitely wouldn’t recommend only eating egg whites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs vs. egg whites: Which is best for weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re trying to lose weight, egg whites provide the beneficial protein without the fat,” says Koenig. According to a 2024 study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.764" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Obesity Science &amp;amp; Practice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Obesity Science &amp;amp; Practice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;higher protein intake is associated with greater weight loss, and egg whites can provide it. Still, whole eggs provide protein too, along with healthy fats that may also support weight loss. “I wouldn’t ever recommend avoiding eggs or egg whites if you’re trying to lose weight,” Delaney says. “Weight loss takes time, it takes time to burn fat, and you need to make sure your diet is healthy and balanced and includes the right type and amount of healthy fats, along with lean protein and carbohydrates, as well as implementing exercise routines that work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs vs. egg whites: Which is better for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither eggs nor egg whites are healthier than the other. “Both have benefits and are excellent protein sources,” says Koenig. “The latest research says that eggs no longer need to be restricted.” That said, if you want to make a dish lower in calories but still high in protein, you might consider removing some yolks and adding more whites, especially if you are trying to hit a certain amount of protein per day, Delaney says. But, if you’re looking for the most nutrients, consider eating the whole egg.

A new study warns that long hours sitting causes significant health issues – even for young, active adults – raising the odds of heart disease and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if that news wasn’t bad enough, researchers also argue that today’s federal exercise recommendations don’t fully counteract the harm caused by excessive sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aging studies that focus on people in their 60s, this project zeroed in on younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Riverside&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1,000 Colorado residents, with an average age of 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-from-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Health risks from prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reports that logging eight or more seated hours a day pushes two early warning signs in the wrong direction – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;cholesterol ratio&lt;/a&gt; and body mass index (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;) – even for people who work out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol ratio, which blends triglyceride and cholesterol levels to flag cardiovascular risk, and BMI, an estimate of body fat, both climbed with prolonged sitting, signaling potential trouble ahead if habits don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though unhealthy diet and smoking play a major role in increasing BMI, the full-point jump we saw in the data was just due to sitting alone,” said Ryan Bruellman, lead researcher and doctoral candidate in UCR’s Department of &lt;a href="https://genetics.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-twin-driven-analysis"&gt;Twin-driven analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large twin-and-sibling project examined how sitting time and exercise intensity relate to these “aging” &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included over a thousand adults, ages 28 to 49, with an average age in the early thirties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group mixed adopted siblings, non-adopted siblings, and both identical and fraternal twins to help separate lifestyle effects from genetics and shared upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants reported about 60 hours of sitting each week – roughly 8.6 hours per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men tended to report more vigorous activity and also showed higher BMI and TC/HDL cholesterol levels than women. Sitting time was roughly normally distributed across the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team modeled how BMI and TC/HDL change with age while accounting for sitting time and physical activity intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made a clear distinction between “moderate” activity and “vigorous” activity because a brisk walk does not stress the body like hard running or fast cycling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also used a “co-twin control” approach: comparing one twin directly to their co-twin to reduce genetic and family-environment noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In plain terms, if an identical twin who moves harder and sits less shows better biomarker values than their genetically matched twin, behavior is a plausible contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-and-health-hard-data"&gt;Sitting and health – hard data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More sitting tracked with a drift in the wrong direction over the thirties and forties: higher BMI and a higher TC/HDL ratio. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercising-more-than-recommended-may-greatly-reduce-health-risk-of-early-death-from-any-cause/"&gt;Vigorous activity&lt;/a&gt; was shown to push those levels back to normal ranges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When models accounted for sitting time, people who did around 30 minutes of vigorous exercise per day showed BMI and TC/HDL values similar to those of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-minute-of-short-energy-burst-exercise-every-day-can-add-years-to-your-life/"&gt;sedentary people&lt;/a&gt; who were five to ten years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin comparisons reinforced this pattern. In identical and fraternal pairs, the twin who sat less and did more vigorous activity tended to show better TC/HDL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A focused test looked at identical twins who were “discordant,” meaning they differed enough in overall health, sitting times, and vigorous exercise for a fair comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairs were sorted into two styles: “Active Replacers,” who swapped some sitting time for vigorous exercise; and “Active Compensators,” who sat a lot but tried to offset it with more vigorous exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math defined an “exchange” as replacing each extra hour of weekly sitting with about six minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-law-of-diminishing-returns"&gt;Law of diminishing returns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed a very clear correlation: less sitting and more vigorous movement was directly linked to a healthier TC/HDL profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits from vigorous activity showed diminishing returns. Moving from almost none to a reasonable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;daily dose&lt;/a&gt; mattered a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, adding more and more did not keep producing the same improvement in TC/HDL. Vigorous work can compensate for sitting to a point, yet reducing sitting still looked “paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health guidance offers simple guardrails: 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Intensity definitely matters for certain outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lipids and metabolic risk, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/six-minutes-of-vigorous-exercise-helps-protect-the-brain-from-aging/"&gt;vigorous minutes&lt;/a&gt; often deliver extra value. Moderate activity still counts; this result highlights where vigorous work seems especially potent for these early biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-of-biomarkers"&gt;Limitations of biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, this one had limitations. BMI and TC/HDL are informative, not definitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were relatively young adults, so we are looking at early warning signs, not clinical disease. This was not a randomized trial; no one assigned people to sit or sprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin design, including the “co-twin control” comparison, adds strength beyond typical observational studies, but it cannot prove causation the way a trial can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported sitting time can be fuzzy. Wearable devices could sharpen future estimates and help test whether replacing specific chunks of sitting with short, vigorous bouts delivers consistent shifts in TC/HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vigorous-exercise-and-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Vigorous exercise and prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, prolonged sitting is much more damaging to human health than scientists had ever imagined, particularly in younger people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This twin-and-sibling study suggests that how much we sit and how hard we move shows up in early risk markers for heart and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-quality-could-be-the-key-to-better-metabolic-health/"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across adults in their late 20s to late 40s, more sitting was linked to higher BMI and a higher total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, regular vigorous activity pushed those numbers in a healthier direction, with roughly 30 minutes a day associated with profiles similar to sedentary people 5-10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study makes it clear: if you sit for long periods, the standard exercise recommendations are not enough,” Bruellman concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All adults, even the younger ones, need to move more, and exercise harder, to counteract the impact of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break up long sitting spells. Stand more during tasks. Add walking between activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a routine that includes some vigorous minutes most days – enough to push breathing and heart rate safely for your fitness level. Reducing sitting and adding vigorous movement worked best together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308660#sec017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 01:28:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPRDBUd21vWU5WUXFuc0hkbFllWGV5V2RkTFdCeVdGTWdiS3BzOUEtTUg2TDl2MDhhTXZabVNybzZHX1NuUmlfbGJmd3g4X2gtMTZhUDhZeDQtUnA1bnFRdFVJMEZPTnBSU2pTQXJ4MWQ3eEExd1pndUJ2VVFkNVlfMnJNeEwwVXpPRGE0R1NPckg2bVZXeWlfTGhuaWlaZkdtMjl2dVpVdzBVbDV6TklCTFdR</guid></item><item><title>专家声音报警：与自杀有关的流行脱发药物- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/experts-sound-alarm-popular-hair-loss-drug-linked-to-suicide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:37:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOc21HTHNoTi10R3ZRUndQbGRkeVpjTzBhQ3BvZ0xOMnJWRkFfQmxKa05fd1VwSTVBWjdodGpLQm5jSmlCZFRQOE9xS0dJNjRMYk14YkNyenVNR0V0Vmh6M1B2WUhnbWp4VUs2cTAzR1BIbDR2ZWlZYUFDTENrcVFYUDl3SUZpdW95NG5XOWd1Zw</guid></item><item><title>你是哪个卧铺？新研究揭示了5种主要的睡眠模式以及它们揭示了您的健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/which-sleeper-are-you-new-study-reveals-5-major-sleep-patterns-and-what-they-reveal-about-your-health/photostory/124468209.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the most vital “non-negotiable” aspects of a healthy life – we all know that. Whether you’re aiming to take care of your heart, preserve your cognitive health, or even in a pursuit to shed some pounds, sleep is one of your most reliable allies. Now, while most advice tells you to “get eight hours,” a new large-scale study suggests that how we sleep may matter just as much as how long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists who studied hundreds of adults using brain scans, sleep journals, and lifestyle data, there are five distinct sleeper profiles — and each comes with its own clues about your mental, physical, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revelation is a shift from the one-size-fits-all approach to sleep. It suggests that even two people who sleep the same number of hours might differ drastically in how restorative that sleep is — based on how often they wake, whether they need sleep aids, and how energized (or drowsy) they feel during the day. In short: not all sleepers are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we break down each of the five sleep patterns, explore what they can reveal about your health, and offer ideas on what to do if your sleep type is less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to break the yawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:32:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州东南部的狂犬病蝙蝠咬人- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2025/10/rabid-bat-bites-person-in-southeast-michigan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L67J2QSAFBD75E5C4HFG5LHPZE"&gt;ST.

However, a video shared on social media incorrectly claimed that oil is not actually a fossil fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the team at &lt;a href="https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/false-oil-claim-resurfaces-in-social-media-videos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AAP FactCheck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;AAP FactCheck&lt;/a&gt; explained, the misinformation about the source of oil was &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=758829179854937&amp;amp;rdid=scrIDXIkjsBM50TL" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shared on Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shared on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; with the caption of "the truth about oil." The text above the video reads: "Dinosaurs never existed. Fossil fuels are a myth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The myths about oil are partially attributed to L. Fletcher Prouty, who appeared in the video, explaining in a 1994 interview that he was a proponent of the &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008RG000270" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"abiotic oil" theory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;"abiotic oil" theory&lt;/a&gt;, which states that fossil fuels are formed through nonbiological chemical processes deep within the Earth's mantle, rather than from the decay of ancient organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prouty claimed that oil magnate John D. Rockefeller coined the term "fossil fuel" to create the false perception of scarcity and drive up prices. But according to AAP FactCheck, this claim has been "debunked multiple times," and evidence shows that the term has been used in reference to crude oil at least since the 1700s in &lt;a href="https://eartharchives.psu.edu/2020/04/13/fossil-fuels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:works by German chemist Caspar Neumann;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;works by German chemist Caspar Neumann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More importantly, however, is that the overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence point to the biogenic (fossil fuel) origin for most petroleum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chris Elders, a Curtin University petroleum geologist, told AAP FactCheck that since oil has "carbon isotopes that are similar to the living organisms from which they're derived," along with many biomarkers (molecules derived from living organisms), there's solid evidence that oil comes from decomposed organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prouty also alleged that because "there has never been a fossil, a real fossil, found below 16,000 feet," the theory that oil comes from formerly living matter doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Simon George, a petroleum geochemistry expert at Macquarie University, refuted this claim, stating that fossils have been found at greater depths, per AAP FactCheck. Regardless, the word "fossil" in this context doesn't actually refer to actual mineralized fossils like dinosaur bones, but to the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/06/28/though-ancient-fossil-fuels-dont-actually-come-from-fossils/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prehistoric organic origins of oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prehistoric organic origins of oil&lt;/a&gt; and other petroleum products created from the long process of decomposition under intense heat and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In summary, AAP FactCheck stated that "reserves of inorganic origin have never been found" and cited a 2006 review published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-3928.2006.tb00271.x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Resource Geology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Resource Geology&lt;/a&gt; that concluded abiotic oil theories are "invalid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regardless of where oil comes from, more than &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:99.9% of climate scientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;99.9% of climate scientists&lt;/a&gt; agree that human activity, primarily the burning of dirty fuels such as oil and gas, is the main factor driving extreme weather and rising global temperatures.

Some infected people also may experience fevers, headaches, and body aches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the illness so alarming to health experts is that it is highly contagious with a short incubation period. Officials say that some people can experience symptoms as early as 10 to 12 hours after exposure to the virus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person, eating/handling contaminated food (especially shellfish), and touching contaminated surfaces, officials warn. According to experts, the norovirus can remain on surfaces for hours, and sometimes days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outbreaks may occur in places where people consume water and/or food prepared or handled by others, such as nursing homes, hospitals, restaurants, cruise ships, banquet halls, summer camps, and family dinners,” an NJ DOH statement read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say the best way to prevent norovirus is to wash your hands with soap often and thoroughly. This is especially important when handling food, changing diapers, or caring for an infected person. Officials add that using hand sanitizer is significantly less effective than washing your hands when combating norovirus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See prevention methods, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands well and often. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook shellfish thoroughly and wash fruits and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash laundry in hot water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you contract norovirus, you should do your best to avoid contact with healthy people to help contain it. The CDC specifically asks infected people to steer clear of immunocompromised people, including seniors and children under five years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, experts ask that infected people continue to isolate and practice preventive measures two days after they feel better, as the virus can still be transmitted even after symptoms disappear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These preventative measures are especially important for people who work in restaurants, schools, daycares, long-term care facilities, or “other places where you may expose people to norovirus,” the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment or cure for the norovirus, and officials remind residents that antibiotics will not help norovirus symptoms, as it's not a bacterial infection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts recommend plenty of rest and consuming plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting. Water, juices, and electrolytes are encouraged, but sick people should avoid drinks containing alcohol or caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people should also avoid food that may trigger symptoms, sticking to “bland” foods like toast, rice, and bananas until symptoms improve, experts say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus typically lasts one to three days, according to officials. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials say patients should seek medical attention when experiencing the following: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe dehydration (dry mouth, sunken eyes, decreased urination) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in your vomit or stool &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent vomiting or diarrhea (more than three days) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (over 101°F) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe abdominal pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;To learn more about norovirus, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;CDC’s website here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiBox-root css-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:11:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNdU9BUzFSemtGZWhxeGk3UW4yUWRVb1BjX1U1VVQ5cDV6dDNObFd2LVVfaUlEQndyVERXOHlBN2RWMUQzNXNGT193N0xXUmZZLXY2ZFJJaHJheUJTRWdQU0xjZk8yZDdhc0l0TjBrY0ZuanZNYzRQQjJUUGpfRHhyRHFKM2F2ZVdSZzZtc9IBpgFBVV95cUxOR3pJTjRENEp3enhQVFJQUTRTY2Vkck92MW9OM3BiRVE1T3NELWFvRllQMDhXSmFSbHRpS3BIZUJXYjRWQlByc1ZDTkF1d2gwSmhFT0RXWGtNRWU1bks5N3l2RlNHZ2d6MVNSZWhUbXFGbHpwMlpIREJqRzJMN25HdFloOTJySjhOeTBfUkF5YV9wN2ZRRFJSN0lnWVVyekR4VDQyLWZR</guid></item><item><title>关于全国乳腺癌宣传月的总统致辞-白宫（ .gov ）</title><link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/10/presidential-message-on-national-breast-cancer-awareness-month/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;A PROCLAMATION&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day, breast cancer upends the lives of countless Americans, subjecting them and their loved ones to unimaginable fear, uncertainty, and heartbreak.  This National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the resilience and courage of those battling breast cancer—and we reaffirm our commitment to ending this horrific disease once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One in every 8 women in the United States will face breast cancer during their lifetime.  My Administration is determined to end this tragedy.  As part of our historic Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are working to lower cancer rates so that fewer lives, families, and futures will be devastated by cancer’s enduring physical and emotional torment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration urges all Americans to prioritize their health by knowing their family history and other risk factors, using methods of early detection, and implementing preventative protocols and lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk. We also commit to the continued prioritization of research and medical advancements that accelerate cures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month, we rejoice with our Nation’s four million breast cancer survivors, we pray for those who are fighting for remission and healing, and we mourn with all who have lost a precious loved one.  United in purpose, we commit to working towards a healthy, prosperous, and cancer-free American future.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;(Willmar MN-)  Bird flu has made it's first reappearance in Kandiyohi County this fall.   On Tuesday the Minnesota Board of Animal Health confirmed Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in a commercial turkey meat bird operation in a flock of 32,900 birds in Kandiyohi County.   On Wednesday they confirmed it in two flocks in Becker County, one in an operation with 30,000 and another in a flock of 72,500.  And on Thursday it was confirmed in a flock of 40,169 in Kandiyohi County.  Bird flu is believed to be spread by migrating wild birds, and had not been seen in Minnesota since April, but on September 16th it was detected in a flock in Redwood County and there have been several other detections since.   Dr. Shauna Voss at the Minnesota Poultry Testing Lab in Willmar says there is no vaccine for avian influenza and the only defense is strict bio-security measures by poultry operations...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-audio  subscriber-hide tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-audio tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most flu patients do not die from the infection, but rather a complication triggered by the disease. The disease can weaken the immune system, raising the risk of someone suffering from sepsis or pneumonia, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu levels are currently 'minimal' nationwide, according to CDC surveillance, but have risen slightly in four states, including North Carolina. Other states with elevated levels are Connecticut, Illinois and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levels of RSV and norovirus are also low nationwide, but Covid levels are 'moderate', according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that as colder weather hits, people will spend more time mixing indoors, allowing respiratory viruses to spread easily between individuals. They say levels are currently low because the nation is in the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, infections, hospitalizations and deaths from respiratory viruses tend to peak between December and February, before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 40million Americans were infected with the flu, while 400,000 were hospitalized and 25,000 died from complications linked to their infections, in what the CDC called 'one of the worst' flu seasons in over a decade. In that year, cases peaked in early February, before gradually declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North Carolina, the state recorded its worst flu season last year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, registering 544 fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's Department of Health revealed the flu fatality in a press release posted online on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes after six counties in California, including Sonoma County (shown above), reimposed their mask mandates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now urging all residents aged six months and over to ensure they receive a flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also said Covid vaccines were recommended for everyone aged six months and over, even after the Robert F Kennedy-run CDC shifted its guidelines to recommend Covid vaccines to those aged 18 years and older. The agency says parents of children aged six months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the CDC shows that in the week to September 20, the latest available, there were eight flu-related deaths recorded nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is outside the start of the 2025 to 2026 flu season, which the CDC says begins in October, but indicates that flu deaths were likely recorded elsewhere in the US this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wake County Director of Nursing, Tina Payton, with Wake County being the North Carolina County for Raleigh, the capital of the state in its central area, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc11.com/post/flu-death-2025-season-nc-person-dies-related-illness-first-influenza-vax-urged-wake-opens-clinic/17965330/"&gt;ABC11&lt;/a&gt;: 'We see more respiratory illnesses as it gets colder and we're headed into that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives you a chance to build your immunity before the holidays come up, and that's always a big time where people get together indoors and there's a higher opportunity for illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes after at least six counties in California's Bay Area&lt;span&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the North Carolina Department of Health shows the proportion of ED visits due to respiratory viruses over the last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flu activity remains minimal across much of the US, although it has ticked up slightly in four states, Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina and Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting November 1, each will require health workers and, in some cases, visitors or patients, to wear face coverings in medical settings used by frail, ailing or vulnerable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mandate in Sonoma County has been set to be renewed every year unless it is repealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are scant reports of other counties considering face mask mandates at present, although experts say this may shift as cooler weather approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data for North Carolina shows visits to the state's Emergency Departments for a respiratory disease dropped to 5.4 percent of the total in the week to October 4, the latest available, down from 6.4 percent in the previous seven-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid-like illnesses, infections that are suspected to be Covid but are not confirmed, were the most common reason for ED visits, behind 1.8 percent in the latest week, followed by flu-like, at 0.6 percent, and RSV-like, at 0.2 percent, with both of these also being infections suspected to be down to these diseases that had not been confirmed via tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining 2.8 percent did not have the type of respiratory virus they were suffering from determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:52:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOYVR5azhudXl4aGhvT29EMVdSWXZLQVpoWGZMV3d5OElPbDZ3VXZ1RnpWOUJjdC1ZZ2Q0TjM5RTg4bXJsRVVZZjlVVGxJVzN3VUtlc1R3ZV9xTHBzMTl3S1ExZUtEdjZlaEVwWFNsSlcwcHlSN0tVeGpFczlBX19RZzJFX3NEOHBWNTNFYlFHRy1SQdIBlwFBVV95cUxPV0dnYkp4RDFNcmdGaVRfbzhaSWdHeVlKNXlRQThwOWE1c1pqU25HYU53clp2RFRzOGJaNnlJajdxY3pZUHdCcHdpOTJMVzNSVmZhbmlTZDFZUmsyVWhncS1USTB3dzh6SkdwbHRWTksyT2piaU1CUFB4blRqSk1Gc0Y3eFlKd1dmbW4xaGZiclF3eC13REJj</guid></item><item><title>由于“绝对数字” ，专家发出警报，致命的罕见癌症在年轻人中激增-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15178747/breast-cancer-rising-women-American-Cancer-Society.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are warning that rates of a rare but highly deadly cancer are on the rise in the US, with cases climbing three times faster than other forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key finding from 2012 to 2021 was that the invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a type of breast cancer, incidence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13912601/doctors-warn-cancer-rate-rising-young-people.html"&gt;climbed at an average&lt;/a&gt; annual rate of 2.8 percent in women 50 and older and 2.9 percent among women younger than 50.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This rise across age groups exceeds the 0.8 percent increase for all other breast cancers combined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The period from 2016 to 2021 was most concerning, showing an even sharper annual increase of 3.4 percent. Hormonal and lifestyle factors, not genetics, are the primary drivers behind the rising rates of invasive lobular carcinoma, experts say.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the American Cancer Society reported this week that the steepest rise in lobular breast cancer cases was among Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) women, with an increase of 4.4 percent per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this rapid increase, white women still have the highest overall case rate with nearly 15 cases per 100,000 women, compared to 11 per 100,000 among Black women and approximately seven per 100,000 among AAPI women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Angela Giaquinto, an associate scientist for cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said: ‘Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lobular form of the disease appears to grow in ways that differ from the other breast cancers, with cells proliferating in dispersed patterns as opposed to forming a lump typical of other cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lobular breast cancer grows differently than other breast cancers. Instead of forming a distinct lump, its cells spread in dispersed patterns. This makes it more difficult to detect through traditional mammograms and physical exams (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The growth pattern of ILC doesn't make it categorically more aggressive in terms of metastasis, but it makes its spread differently, sometimes later, and to unusual locations, which poses unique &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14150127/mammogram-cancer-incurable-Doctors-reveal-harder-spot-stop-happening-YOU.html"&gt;challenges for detection&lt;/a&gt; and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed national cancer data, comparing invasive lobular breast cancer cases against all other types to track incidence trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized software, they calculated rates and tested for statistical differences in trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also compared patient and tumor characteristics between lobular and ductal cancers and analyzed their ten-year survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While ILC has a similar five-year survival rate to other breast cancers, its long-term outlook is less favorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ten-year survival rate is lower, largely because ILC has a higher risk of late recurrence and tends to spread to uncommon sites in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For lobular cancer that has spread distantly, the 10-year survival rate is only 12.1 percent compared to 19.6 percent for the more common ductal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lobular breast cancer is becoming more common, and its long-term survival rates are low once it spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to finding that rates of ILC are rising over three times faster than all other breast cancers, its slight survival advantage in the first few years disappears over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giaquinto said: ‘Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for [lobular breast cancer] than the most common type of breast cancer, highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This chart tracks lobular breast cancer diagnosis rates across different racial and ethnic groups in the US from 1975 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White women had the highest rates across every age group, with risk peaking between ages 70-79 before declining&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors conclude that ILC's unique biology, which makes it harder to detect and potentially less responsive to chemotherapy, requires specific research and clinical attention to improve these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior researcher Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director for cancer surveillance research at the ACS, said: ‘Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are occurring consistently across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uniform pattern is notable because ILC is rising at similar rates in both younger and older populations, unlike some other breast cancer types that typically show more variation between age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pointed to hormonal and lifestyle risk factors as the main drivers of the increasing incidence over genetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ILC is described as being ‘more strongly associated with female hormone exposure’ than other breast cancers, evidenced by a steeper drop in ILC cases when menopausal women’s use of hormone therapy went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart tracks ten-year ILC survival from 2007 to 2021. While early-stage ILC shows better survival, distant-stage disease survival plummets to just 12 percent compared to 20 percent for ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also specifically pointed to the impacts of increasing rates of excess body weight, a younger age at first menstruation and having fewer children or having a first birth at an older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors that extend a woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen, such as a later age at menopause, along with increased alcohol consumption in some groups, are also identified as significant contributors to the growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70061"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the American Cancer Society.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Siegel concluded: ‘Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The scientists report that those who received a shingles vaccine shot were at a definitive health advantage over the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were less likely to receive a new dementia diagnosis during the next seven years. The analysis made use of a policy quirk to compare people born just before and after a vaccine eligibility cutoff in 2013. This helped separate cause from coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/varicella-zoster-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VZV&lt;/a&gt;) can go quiet in nerve cells for decades. Later, it can return as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herpes zoster&lt;/a&gt;, better known as shingles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovery from chickenpox, the virus stays latent in the nervous system and can reactivate as immunity wanes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-actually-tested"&gt;What the study actually tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Pascal Geldsetzer at &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, who studies large health datasets to answer practical questions in medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team focused on people who turned 80 in late 2013, because a small birthday difference determined who could get the shingles vaccine that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this a natural experiment. It was a real-world situation that mimicked a trial because a rule or cutoff split otherwise similar people into different groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those just old enough to miss the program served as a comparison group for those barely young enough to be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing near identical birth cohorts, the analysis made it less likely that differences in health habits or clinic access explained the result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That design choice strengthened the case that the shingles vaccine itself mattered for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-drug-helps-protect-memory-in-brain-diseases-like-alzheimers/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a really striking finding,” said Geldsetzer, summarizing the signal they kept seeing across checks and sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-shingles-vaccine-lowers-risk-more"&gt;New shingles vaccine lowers risk more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea is simple – fewer viral reactivations may mean less inflammation near nerves and blood vessels that serve the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea is broader – vaccination can tune immune pathways that influence brain health in ways not limited to one microbe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; compared the older live vaccine, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/zostavax/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zostavax&lt;/a&gt;, with the newer recombinant vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/shingrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shingrix&lt;/a&gt;. Shingrix was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of dementia than Zostavax. It also had a lower risk than other common adult vaccines in similar age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shingrix includes an adjuvant, a substance that heightens the immune response to a vaccine’s antigen. That extra kick could be one reason the newer shot shows a stronger association with brain outcomes in population data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Welsh analysis and other large population studies point toward the same conclusion. Shingles vaccination appears to do more than prevent shingles, and the newer recombinant vaccine could be even more effective in lowering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-shingles-vaccines"&gt;What this means for shingles vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax used a weakened form of the virus and is no longer the routine shingles vaccine in many places. Shingrix, which is a recombinant vaccine given in two doses, has replaced it in standard adult schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax and Shingrix both aim to prevent shingles, yet they work differently. Zostavax uses a live, attenuated virus, while Shingrix uses a viral protein plus an adjuvant to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-trick-immune-system-into-stronger-vaccine-response/"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; the immune system more directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical takeaway is simple. A shingles vaccine remains a tool to prevent shingles. Any added protection for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; is a possible bonus that researchers are still testing, not a reason to treat vaccination as a dementia drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh analysis used routine health records, which can miss or delay diagnoses. The design, however, focused on people born only a week apart around the policy cutoff time, which helps balance many hidden differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biology is not settled. Reduced viral reactivation could be part of the story, and immune training unrelated to the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-cases-of-tropical-virus-oropouche-spread-by-mosquito-are-recorded-in-uk/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; could be another part. Both are testable in future mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects tens of millions of people. According to a recent WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;factsheet&lt;/a&gt;, there are about 57 million people worldwide living with dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-think-about-risk-and-causality"&gt;How to think about risk and causality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies can be skewed if people who get vaccinated also do other healthy things. This project reduced that concern by using an eligibility threshold to compare very similar groups separated by a quirk of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cleanest proof comes from randomized trials that assign the shot or a placebo and follow people over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of trial would show whether vaccination delays &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; onset, and by how much, across different ages and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population level findings are useful for public health decisions. For individuals, the decision to vaccinate should still rest on the proven benefit of preventing shingles and its complications. Any decision should first be discussed with a clinician who knows your medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNnY3YS04V0pHdzhxYjBxTUZTLUdTRkhLaHk3SWlhZEpBUGJQR3NOOVd2TTBKbDF1U0J4NC1tM2JZVDhyUkhIQjFWNEh5a1FwelE0X3BuNkc4RllicFMyZDBVNUR4TTVvYnotWVN0ZnNmS1Bta1JENFBMU0ZtRTVlV2o3T3lITEJsYnRGY3diY3pBTHk4Y2FRZUZEQ0pjbk41N1M5M1pGM0p0MkU2NVI4</guid></item></channel></rss>
