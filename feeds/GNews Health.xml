              &lt;p&gt;As we enter the colder months in Australia, covid is &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; designated NB.1.8.1 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what do you need to know about this new variant?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The current covid situation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than five years since covid was initially declared a pandemic, we’re still experiencing regular waves of infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/news-data/covid-statistics/"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt; suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAIN-Aust-COVID-19-Stats-worksheet-2025.xlsx-18.pdf"&gt;ticking upwards&lt;/a&gt;. Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;among the circulating strains&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250517.pdf"&gt;generally increasing&lt;/a&gt;. Of cases sequenced &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;up to May 6&lt;/a&gt; across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia &lt;a href="https://www.health.wa.gov.au/articles/a_e/coronavirus/covid19-wastewater-surveillance"&gt;has determined NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;collected in Perth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;late April 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences—up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia—it was the dominant variant in &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md"&gt;Hong Kong and China&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where does this variant come from?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;collected in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-hybrid-covid-strain-behind-vietnams-latest-wave-not-exactly-161879"&gt;Recombinant&lt;/a&gt;” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;a suite of mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us—specifically via the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"&gt;ACE2 receptors&lt;/a&gt;, a “doorway” to our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;mutations include&lt;/a&gt; T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It’s early days for this variant, so we don’t have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested—suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains. The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;LP.8.1.1&lt;/a&gt;. This means it’s possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; compared to other variants. Reports suggest &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-in-cases-recently-symptoms-associated-with-it/photostory/121373694.cms"&gt;symptoms of NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches, and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How about the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia’s winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated covid boosters.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Even if neutralising antibody levels &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;are modestly reduced&lt;/a&gt; against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current covid vaccines should still &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;protect against severe disease&lt;/a&gt; with this variant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;targets JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another covid booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;if you’re eligible&lt;/a&gt;. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, covid can still be a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/lara-herrero-1166059"&gt;Lara Herrero&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor and Research Leader in Virology and Infectious Disease, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/griffith-university-828"&gt;Griffith University&lt;/a&gt;.

Visitors heading to Oahu’s North Shore are being asked to take mosquito precautions as health officials respond." data-app-id-name="post_above_content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii health officials have just confirmed a travel-related case of Zika virus on Oahu—the first such detection in the state since 2019. While the virus was not contracted locally, the Department of Health is urging travelers to take precautions, especially on the island’s north shore in the Waialua and Haleiwa areas, where the infected individual spent time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vector control teams are actively working to prevent any potential mosquito-borne transmission. The state has not issued any restrictions, but the fact that visitors are mentioned in this alert is a reminder that visitors play a role in preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in tropical destinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-zika-virus-matters-for-hawaii-travelers"&gt;Why Zika virus matters for Hawaii travelers.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes. Most people infected do not experience symptoms, but the virus poses serious risks during pregnancy—including birth defects and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises anyone pregnant or planning pregnancy to consult their doctor before traveling to areas where Zika has been identified. Hawaii is not classified as an outbreak zone, but the presence of the &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; mosquito in the islands means transmission could occur if precautions are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State health officials confirmed that this is the first known Zika case tied to Hawaii travel in more than five years. During the 2015–2017 global Zika outbreak, Hawaii reported multiple travel-linked cases but avoided local spread. Officials hope to continue that record, with visitor cooperation being one key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-zika-case-was-detected-in-hawaii"&gt;Where the Zika case was detected in Hawaii.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The individual who tested positive for Zika had visited Waialua and Haleiwa on Oahu’s North Shore. These beachside towns are popular with visitors seeking a quieter alternative to Waikiki, offering access to lush hiking trails among its other attractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are no closures or travel advisories for the area, but mosquito mitigation teams are spraying and monitoring affected zones. The Department of Health says two other people may also have been exposed and are being evaluated at this time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although no locally transmitted Zika cases have ever occurred in Hawaii, health officials consider any confirmed case reason enough to increase public awareness—especially in places with high visitor traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hawaii-travelers-can-reduce-mosquito-risk"&gt;How Hawaii travelers can reduce mosquito risk.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika prevention is focused around avoiding mosquito bites. Hawaii’s Department of Health recommends taking steps for anyone spending time outdoors, particularly in North Shore communities or other warm, humid parts of the islands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use insect repellent approved by the EPA that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Reapply as needed, especially after swimming or sweating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wear lightweight long sleeves and pants, even during the day. The mosquitoes that carry Zika are active in daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. If not available, use mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eliminate standing water at vacation rentals, including in buckets, planters, and even outdoor toys or gear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, travelers returning from an area with Zika risk—including Hawaii when travel-linked cases are active—should avoid getting bitten for at least three weeks to help prevent mosquito transmission back home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-have-any-symptoms-after-your-hawaii-trip"&gt;What if you have any symptoms after your Hawaii trip.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika symptoms are typically mild and may include fever, rash, red eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, or headache. They usually last less than a week and are often missed or mistaken for other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you develop any of these symptoms within two weeks of leaving Hawaii—or any destination where mosquito-borne viruses are possible—contact your doctor and mention your travel history. Testing is usually only done if symptoms are present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though rare, Zika has been associated with serious complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurological issues. Awareness remains the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-north-shore-oahu-travel"&gt;What this means for North Shore Oahu travel.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, travel to Haleiwa and Waialua continues and should pose no issues. Visitors in the area are advised to take basic mosquito precautions, and those planning to visit soon should come prepared with repellent and protective clothing. Taking a few extra steps to prevent bites can help protect you and the islands from more serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that Hawaii has never had a locally transmitted Zika outbreak and that the Department of Health continues to respond quickly when travel-related cases are identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time the North Shore has seen enhanced vector control. It has happened during past alerts for dengue and other mosquito-related issues. Each time, Hawaii avoided wider spread, thanks in part to cooperation from visitors and residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pregnant travelers or those with health concerns should consult the latest CDC guidelines and speak to a medical professional. For most others, a few mosquito precautions are all that’s needed to travel responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-you-re-traveling-to-hawaii-this-summer"&gt;If you’re traveling to Hawaii this summer.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, especially to areas around Haleiwa, take a moment to at least think about mosquito protection. Beat of Hawaii editors will be on Oahu’s north shore in the next couple of weeks and will be doing the same thing. Pack what you need, stay aware, and help protect the islands by being part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/_5Ghp6y2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

            Who among us wouldn’t want to live a good life well into our 90s, especially if we could do it disease-free while still being as witty and spry as Betty White, as eloquent as Toni Morrison or as civically engaged as Jimmy Carter?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000j3b6m1lvdh8zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you’d need good genes to live that long, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000k3b6msisxvpj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not necessarily, according to Dr. Eric Topol, founding director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, and former chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000l3b6mpag9mxcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For almost 20 years, Topol has been studying a group of 1,400 Super Agers, or people who reached the age of 80 and beyond without developing one of three common, chronic, age-related conditions (cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease), as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/translational-research/genomic-medicine/wellderly/" target="_blank"&gt;Wellderly study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000m3b6mqsd2vty0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To his surprise, when his team conducted whole-genome sequencing on all the Wellderly study participants, the researchers found nothing genetic, across the board, that conferred an age and health advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000n3b6mbhgp16gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol’s new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668" target="_blank"&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity,&lt;/a&gt;” explores the other factors at play and the science that backs them up. He examines lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and sleep. He also looks at new technologies including the following :
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cmb70ih5k000t3b6m3miv974h@published" class="list-elevate vossi-list" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            polygenic risk scores that sift through a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank"&gt;DNA to quantify disease risk&lt;/a&gt;;
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            the new science of “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202165/" target="_blank"&gt;omics&lt;/a&gt;” (for example, proteomics to analyze  the complete set of proteins expressed by a body) that can be used to produce organ clocks measuring how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1" target="_blank"&gt;fast our individual organs are aging&lt;/a&gt;; and
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            artificial intelligence to synthesize all available health data points.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000o3b6mpltt83b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All these technologies show promise  in helping more people, if not reach Super Ager status, then achieve a longer health span by either delaying the onset of disease or aggressively treating conditions to prevent progression and complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000p3b6mlzuq0b72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol, who will soon turn 71, practices what he preaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000q3b6mja2pq84s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope to be (a Super Ager),” he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;If I can get another 10 or 15 years without an age-related disease, that’d be great. And I’ve really doubled down on the things that I can do to help get there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000r3b6m5bov8hs3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exactly which steps has the doctor-scientist who studies Super Agers taken to increase his odds of reaching their ranks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000s3b6mwz48va7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            “I made extensive changes from the research, once we learned that it isn’t in your genes … to achieve healthy aging, free of cancer, free of cardiovascular disease and free of neurodegenerative disease,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h3" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmb70sabr001y3b6mvm0ul65c@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="lessons-taken-to-heart-exercise-sleep-and-diet" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Lessons taken to heart: exercise,    sleep and diet
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s100103b6mcp8hcpfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the biggest changes Topol said he made was to his exercise routine. “I used to only do aerobic exercise, and as a cardiologist, that was my thing,” he said. “Now I do balance training and strength training (as well). It’s an extensive difference. … And so, I’m more strong and fit than I’ve ever been.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200113b6mlf370zjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, exercise is so important that Topol ranks it as No. 1 on the list for anyone who wants to get started on the path of a longer life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200123b6m0y9p5kt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s free. And if you’re not doing anything, if you’re a sedentary, then start with walks, brisk walks if you can, and keep increasing it,” he said. “Challenge yourself (with) hills and pace … if you are working up a sweat, that’s a really good sign.” (Check with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200133b6m9k5mb66t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To get your upper body in shape, he recommends resistance bands, and to improve balance, he said to practice standing on one foot, then the other. “These are all free or cost minimum,” he said, noting that with a few inexpensive items you can do this at home, no gym membership required. “So work on that and then other things will start to fall in place. … If you exercise more, you’ll sleep better, too.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200143b6mz7hofpf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Which brings us to the next major change Topol made.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200153b6metkizjyz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I realized how important (sleep) is because of ‘glymphatics.’ That was a new insight in the book: about deep sleep and getting these waste products out of your brain,” he said, referring to the recently discovered &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which helps flush out waste products in the brain and central nervous system, much like the lymphatic system does for the rest of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200163b6mwu663meq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a poor sleeper,” he confessed, so he worked “extensively” on improving the different factors that could impact it. “Things like … what do I eat? And when do I eat? Also hydrating, mostly early in the day … to have less interrupted sleep.” He added that for him fasting is “detrimental” to his sleep, as are both exercising or eating a big meal too late in the evening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200173b6m2if5s2lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668" target="_blank"&gt;do not give short shrift to sleep regularity,&lt;/a&gt; Topol advised. “I used to go to sleep all over the place (in terms of time), and now I’m very regimented, except for maybe one night a week,” he said, noting that this tweak was “phenomenally effective” in levelling up his sleep game.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200183b6mt7wshe4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for diet, Topol (who hasn’t touched red meat in 40 years but does eat fish) said he wasn’t surprised the evidence showed that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;a plant-based diet with enough lean protein&lt;/a&gt; “prevailed as the best.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200193b6m7fzf49to@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What was interesting, though, is how toxic (and) pro inflammatory &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; were,” he said, adding that he does everything he can to minimize UPF — which he jokingly calls UFOs, or alien food . “It’s hard to get it to zero, but I’ve (made a) conscious effort.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001b3b6m3y0gclgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said he also increased his protein intake “some,” due to his age and because he started strength training, “but I don’t go to toxic levels that are advocated by others, that have no evidence (and) that are pro-inflammatory.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001c3b6mm93mif90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said he keeps protein to about 90 grams a day for his 180-pound (82-kilogram) frame, by adding nuts, legumes (including beans) and more fish, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/business/sardines-tinned-fish-recession-indicator"&gt;even canned tuna&lt;/a&gt; in water, to his diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001d3b6mqgvmrg9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I generally eat a salad every night,” he said. “Now I’m a little more conscious about having something with it. … But (it’s) not the protein craze that’s being advocated by some of the extremists.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Supplements, alcohol and stress
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001f3b6m1q4rj5ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about supplements and vitamins? “I don’t rule out that they could help (if) you have a specific deficiency — if for some reason your vitamin D is very low, or your vitamin B12,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001g3b6myx0lbxa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “for healthy people who are not symptomatic (and) who take good care of themselves,” he said, “there’s no data to show that these provide any benefit” much less an antiaging one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001h3b6mt2kpmd3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think they’re a waste of money, and some of these supplements have potentially adverse effects,” he said. “It’s just infuriating because they’re not regulated, so (marketers) can say anything, and people believe it and buy it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001i3b6m6929cq62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-ground-truth-on-alcohol-intake" target="_blank"&gt;consuming alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, Topol said he keeps his drinking “light,” to fewer than seven drinks per week, after which the risks start adding up quickly. He said it doesn’t seem to affect his own sleep, but it might impact that of others, so he recommends watching out for that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001k3b6mlv60ayhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another top-of-the-list item: mental health and stress management. Topol mainly turns to exercise to help navigate both of these elements, but he said being out in nature is another often-overlooked route.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001l3b6muejyttgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The nature prescription is part of the book. There really is something to this,” he noted, adding that he takes advantage of San Diego’s climate and location to do plenty of hiking and walking. “It’s good for mental health, it’s good for stress and anxiety, just to be out in our environment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001m3b6m7xet5j99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s never too late to start any or all of these lifestyle adjustments, Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001n3b6mw4r65r8v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These diseases take 20 years at least (to develop). So, you get even more (bang) if you start in your 40s and 50s or 60s … but if you start when  you’re 70 (or) 80, you’re still going to derive years of healthy aging, maybe not quite as many, but still,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001o3b6mi2ujqt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And because these common, chronic, age-related conditions — cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases — do take so long to fully manifest, Topol said we have time to intervene to change their trajectory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001p3b6mvxgbr1bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But to fully leverage that  latency period before the symptoms of a disease appear, it’s important to be aware of personal risk, so people and their doctors (and society more broadly) can focus prevention and early detection efforts on the right people at the right time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001q3b6mco9etl5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Knowing one’s risk — that’s the next part, which is: we’re going to prevent these three diseases in the future. We can now, and we’re going to even get better at that,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001r3b6mr5ecws9z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said he learned from his polygenic risk scores that he’s at high risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/coronary-artery-disease.html" target="_blank"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt;, despite not having a family history. So, he has focused on getting his LDL cholesterol down. “I’ve gotten it low, and perhaps I got more aggressive about that. I’ve checked my other lipids, like &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2024/lipoproteina-what-know-about-elevated-levels" target="_blank"&gt;Lp(a)&lt;/a&gt; (lipoprotein[a]), so I feel like I’ve done everything I can to go into high prevent-mode for that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001s3b6m07aqw23n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said wants to get his &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-first-diagnostic-immunome" target="_blank"&gt;immunome&lt;/a&gt; (all the genes and proteins of his immune system) mapped, to measure how well his immune system is functioning. It’s a measurement he believes will one day soon be commonplace for everyone. He already has data on “every virus I’ve ever been exposed to and every autoantibody that I have.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001t3b6myao3pmxa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also plans on having his organ clocks measured, because different organs (such as the heart and brain) age at different rates, putting people at higher risk for certain diseases. “I think it’s going to be very helpful, because then I’ll know (how) my heart organ clock correlates with my risk of heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001u3b6mff0g3bb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So those are some of the things I’ve done and/or I want to do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001v3b6me41vm6m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s an extraordinary time in medicine, because we have a path to prevention,” Topol said, “because of the way the science of aging (is developing), with these metrics like organ clocks and protein biomarkers and our genetics — all these layers of data — we are going to be able to prevent these diseases. And that’s exciting. We’ve never done that before.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The researchers also found that certain genetic differences are associated with how much caffeine people drink and how sensitive they are to its effects. While caffeine use was not strongly linked to sleep satisfaction, people who said caffeine interfered with their sleep typically consumed less of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to explore how caffeine consumption, sleep satisfaction, and psychological distress are connected in people with a history of depression, and whether genetic variants might explain some of these associations. Caffeine is the world’s most widely used psychoactive substance, often praised for its alertness-boosting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at higher doses, or in sensitive individuals, caffeine can increase anxiety and interfere with sleep. Although research has shown that moderate caffeine use may reduce the risk of developing depression in otherwise healthy individuals, less is known about its effects in people who have already been diagnosed or treated for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine is common, viewed as safe, and increasingly marketed toward and consumed by younger people,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-mcintosh-845a10298/"&gt;Harry McIntosh&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD student at the University of Queensland. “At the same time, mental health problems are on the rise and insomnia is an important symptom of a number of mental health disorders. We’re interested in caffeine consumption because it may be something that people suffering from mental health problems can change to improve their mental health and sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers used data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study. Over 11,000 adults who had been diagnosed with or treated for depression completed detailed questionnaires about their caffeine consumption, sleep, and mental health. Of those, about 9,000 also provided DNA samples, allowing researchers to examine genetic differences previously linked to caffeine metabolism and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine consumption was measured by asking participants how many servings of caffeinated coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks they typically drank per day. Participants were grouped into low (0–2 drinks), medium (3–5 drinks), or high (6 or more drinks) caffeine consumers. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, a commonly used measure of anxiety and depression symptoms. Sleep satisfaction was measured with a single question from the Insomnia Severity Index. Participants were also asked whether they felt caffeine interfered with their ability to sleep, which served as a proxy for caffeine sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used linear regression models to examine how caffeine use was related to distress and sleep satisfaction, adjusting for factors such as age, sex, body mass index, and other substance use (including alcohol, nicotine, and painkillers). They also looked at whether specific genetic variants were linked to caffeine intake and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that participants who drank six or more caffeinated drinks per day scored higher on the psychological distress scale than those who consumed fewer drinks. For each additional caffeinated beverage consumed per day, participants’ distress scores increased by 0.2 points on a 50-point scale. While this is a small effect, it was statistically significant. People in the medium caffeine group (3–5 drinks per day) did not differ significantly from those in the low group, suggesting that only higher levels of consumption are linked to greater distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there was little evidence that caffeine consumption negatively affected sleep satisfaction in this group. Although those with higher caffeine intake reported slightly lower sleep satisfaction, the difference was small and did not remain statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected caffeine consumption to be associated with poorer sleep, which it wasn’t,” McIntosh told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, caffeine sensitivity itself appeared to play a larger role. People who reported that caffeine interfered with their sleep were far less likely to drink large amounts of it. Each additional caffeinated drink consumed per day was associated with a 16% lower likelihood of reporting caffeine sensitivity. This suggests that people may naturally reduce their intake if they notice it disrupts their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People naturally adjust how much caffeine they consume based on how they respond to it,” McIntosh said. “If caffeine was negatively impacting you, you’d probably reduce your intake accordingly, this could explain why caffeine was not associated with poor sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic analysis offered further insight into why some people consume more caffeine than others. Several genetic variants were associated with differences in caffeine intake. For example, a variant near the &lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt; gene (rs4410790) was linked to increased caffeine use, while a variant near the &lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt; gene (rs2472297) was linked to lower consumption. These genes are involved in caffeine metabolism. People with faster metabolism may consume more caffeine to maintain the same level of alertness, while slower metabolizers may consume less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate variant near the &lt;em&gt;MMS22L/POU3F2&lt;/em&gt; genes (rs34645063) was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting caffeine sensitivity. This finding is consistent with earlier research showing that this genetic region may be linked to both lower caffeine consumption and increased sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other variants in genes like &lt;em&gt;ADORA2A&lt;/em&gt;—which encodes a receptor targeted by caffeine in the brain—were only weakly linked to consumption and did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Still, the results suggest that genetic differences play a role in shaping both how much caffeine people consume and how their bodies respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is focused on those diagnosed with depression,” McIntosh told PsyPost. “Higher caffeine consumption was associated with higher reported levels of current stress in people regardless of sleep quality. The effect size was not large but was statistically significant. However, we cannot assign a causal relationship because participants may increase caffeine consumption in response to symptoms of depression such as fatigue or lack of motivation. Common genetic variants play a sizeable role in how our body handles caffeine and were associated with consuming a larger or smaller number of caffeinated drinks each day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main strengths of the study is its large sample size and inclusion of genetic data, which allowed researchers to detect even small effects. However, there are some limitations to consider. The data were cross-sectional, meaning they captured only one moment in time. This makes it difficult to determine cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data has only one timepoint and measures variables instead of controlling them experimentally, so we cannot use it to definitively state that caffeine is causing distress, or that people with higher stress are then choosing to consume more caffeine,” McIntosh noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another caveat is that the study sample consisted entirely of people with a history of depression. This means the results may not apply to the general population, especially those without mental health conditions. Future research using more precise measures of caffeine intake and longitudinal designs could help clarify how these relationships unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000545393" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Caffeine Consumption, Psychological Distress, and Insomnia in a Cohort of Individuals with Depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Harry A.

Positive confirmation of avian flu was received on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected poultry farm in this case, which was confirmed to be Hickman's Family Farms by the company itself, has been placed under quarantine, and measures were reportedly quickly put in place to eliminate the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eggs produced after the onset of clinical signs of illness have not entered the food supply, and there have been no signs of illness in humans. Consumers in Arizona and around the nation can remain confident in the safety and quality of eggs and egg products," agricultural officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the general public is considered to be low, with those most at risk of exposure being individuals who are directly involved with the daily care of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is reportedly the second commercial farm located in Maricopa County with poultry that tested positive this month. ABC15 has not confirmed the name of the second location.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/buckeye/help-on-the-way-for-arizona-egg-farmer-getting-shelled-by-bird-flu"&gt;ABC15 reported on cases of avian flu at Hickman's&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, the farm said it had lost more than one million egg-laying hens (20% of its flock) at one of its farms due to the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;See coverage from February 2025 in the video player below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

But experts say this research shouldn’t discourage folks with ADHD, particularly those who manage their diagnosis well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, experts share what you should know about this research and what drivers who have trouble focusing should do to stay safe on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with ADHD are at a higher risk of car accidents because of increased distractions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do a research study where you look at 1,000 people with ADHD, and you compare them to 1,000 people who are perfectly matched in every way except they don’t have the ADHD diagnosis and then you follow them, and you look at the rate of car accidents, you’ll see that the rate of car accidents, most likely, is increased in the people with ADHD in that group of 1,000 people a little bit,” said &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=18679" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Will Cronenwett" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=18679" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Will Cronenwett&lt;/a&gt;, the vice chair for clinical affairs in the department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/examining-how-and-why-teens-adhd-crash" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research in teenagers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/examining-how-and-why-teens-adhd-crash" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Research in teenagers&lt;/a&gt; found that those with ADHD had a 9% higher chance of getting into a car accident that was their fault. Inattentive behavior was the top reason for accidents, while another reason was driving at an unsafe speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might this be? According to &lt;a href="https://www.jackiemorrisonlmft.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jackie Morrison" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jackiemorrisonlmft.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Jackie Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Minnesota, the ADHD brain filters information in a different manner than a neurotypical brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is known to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adhd-signs-women_l_663cd48de4b0fe081b305083" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cause trouble focusing and inattention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="663cd48de4b0fe081b305083" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;cause trouble focusing and inattention&lt;/a&gt; in folks with the disorder, which can, of course, also lead to trouble on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is, in a lot of cases, a truly different amount of information that is coming in. And your brain isn’t filtering out as many distractions,” explained Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so things that an ADHD brain is picking up on might be significantly more than a neurotypical brain, and so there are literally more distractions sometimes for an ADHD brain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an ADHD brain, you need more stimulation and engagement to get your brain in the “task-positive network,” said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The task-positive network is the grouping of your brain systems that turn on and activate when you’re engaged in a task and helps you focus,” she added. If there isn’t enough stimulation, which can happen when you’re driving, your brain isn’t going to go in this network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that doesn’t mean an individual with ADHD should be nervous about driving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts stressed that these research findings don’t mean that individual ADHD drivers are any worse than other drivers on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can say on a population level that ... having a disorder that impairs your attention does increase the risk for driving accidents in that population, but you can’t say anything about a particular individual,” Cronenwett noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, someone with an ADHD diagnosis who manages their ADHD properly can be a safer driver than someone without ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would caution against people looking at the ADHD label as either a flag for ‘now I’m at risk’ versus not at risk,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because people with ADHD can be very well-treated, and their symptoms can be under control, and they can be quite safe,” explained Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distracted driving, in general, can lead to traffic incidents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because someone doesn’t have ADHD doesn’t mean they’re a safe driver by default. There are plenty of other distractions — cellphones, other passengers, day-to-day stress, exhaustion and more — that can put anyone at a higher risk of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, “people won’t be able to pay as good attention to the road when they are fatigued,” said Cronenwett. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drowsy-driving" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drowsy-driving" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt;, 633 car crashes happened as a result of drowsy driving in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I wouldn’t want people to just look at the [ADHD] diagnosis as if that determines whether they are at risk at any particular given moment,” noted Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Alvaro Medina Jurado via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Alvaro Medina Jurado via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Distracted driving, overall, is dangerous.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of focusing on your diagnosis before you start driving, focus on how you feel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before getting in your car, take note of how you’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you tired? Are you distracted because of an argument with your partner? This way, you can decide if you have the faculties to safely operate your car. And this is true for anyone — not just those with ADHD, said Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any number of things influence somebody’s risk more than just the strict presence or absence of a label,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel focused enough to drive, don’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we can all agree that distracted drivers, or inattentive drivers, are at risk for having car crashes, and they should certainly be very, very careful in their own driving habits,” said Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, people can be distracted because they’re tired, because of stressful social situations or even from depression and anxiety, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, any type of inattentive or distracted driving puts somebody at risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an ADHD diagnosis and want one, Morrison said it could be a good idea to find a doctor or therapist in the field who has an understanding of ADHD and can help you learn more about how your brain works so you can efficiently and safely move through the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who can’t get diagnosed because of a lack of insurance coverage, long appointment wait times or for whatever reason, Morrison recommends mindfulness as a way to combat distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be aware of your body in space and your breath for a few minutes at a time, and let thoughts move in and out ... you’re just experiencing what it’s like to be in your body at that moment in time. [It] can be really helpful because it gives your brain a chance to run around off its leash, if you will, and it also gives you practice being present without distracting yourself and without stimulation,” Morrison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And when you’re driving, it can be boring — so, basically you’re practicing getting bored,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also be helpful to train your brain to move slower, said Morrison — “because the ADHD brain wants to go fast and it wants to be efficient, even though, arguably, it can be very inefficient at times.” Instead of rushing to prep food or unpack your groceries, take your time while doing it, said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[This] can be helpful just to help your body become more comfortable with that inefficiency or that slowness,” Morrison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body and brain want to move fast, and that’s not always the safest option when driving, so you’re literally helping your body to practice being slow and inefficient, to just get used to that discomfort,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

    &lt;p&gt;For many of us, our 20s are a decade of hedonism – of giving barely a passing thought to our health. It’s the era where we chain smoke, binge drink and shun exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that by their mid-30s, this kind of party lifestyle will take its toll. Researchers in Finland found there were relatively few consequences to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/alcohol-gut-microbiome/"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt; and smoking in people’s 20s, but those who continued these habits found their health begin to deteriorate at 36. Over the course of their lifetime, they were found to result in a plethora of health problems including higher rates of depression, cancer, heart disease, lung disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the decade from 36 to 46 is a pivotal one for our future wellbeing. “What you do in that window shapes the health you’ll experience in the decades to come,” says Dr Philip Borg, an NHS oncologist and founder of The Longevity Doctor, a clinic specialising in preventative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Accumulative damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s in our mid to late-30s that we stop “getting away” with unhealthy behaviour, as the cumulative effects of our lifestyle begin to show their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic diseases are caused by long-term, silent processes like inflammation, triggered by habits including poor diet, stress, drinking, smoking and lack of exercise, which can slowly damage your cells, arteries and brain, starting decades before symptoms appear,” says Dr Borg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this age, much of the damage can be undone – for instance, people who quit smoking by the age of 35 were shown in a 2022 &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797597" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of half a million Americans to have a similar long-term mortality risk to people who have never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/decline-in-lung-cancer-greatest-modern-medical-achievement/"&gt;rates of lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; caused by smoking begin to rise steadily in the 40-44 age range, steadily for women and more rapidly for men, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my clinic, I frequently see patients who wish they’d stopped habits like smoking earlier,” says Dr James Wilson, a consultant clinical oncologist at UCLH. “Age 36-46 is when we start to see patients developing conditions such as cancer, which could have been avoided with lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because the damage to within our cells builds up increasingly quickly from this age onwards. “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/senescent-cells/"&gt;Senescent cells&lt;/a&gt; are ones which have stopped dividing but are still active, and create an inflammatory environment which damages neighbouring cells,” explains Dr Borg. “The more unhealthy your lifestyle, the more of these cells you accumulate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption is linked to seven types of cancer, including breast and bowel, with 17,000 cases of cancer attributed to alcohol every year in the UK. Again, its impact increases past the age of 35, as our ability to metabolise it decreases and the damage it causes to the liver accumulates, putting us at increased risk of liver disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve exposed your body to excessive drinking during this decade, you can’t reverse the risk,” says Dr Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;A decade of change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decade from 36 to 46 is a time in which women in particular, but also men, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/why-your-sex-drive-changes-every-stage-of-life/"&gt;go through vast hormonal changes&lt;/a&gt;, which play a major role in our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, oestrogen and progesterone begins to decline as menopause approaches. “This affects everything, from a decrease in muscle mass and bone density, to lower immunity and our ability to process sugar and fats,” says Dr Harpal Bains, a longevity specialist and the medical director at Harpal Clinic. It also increases women’s risk of diseases including &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/early-warning-signs-osteoporosis/"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, diabetes, depression, obesity and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men’s testosterone levels peak in their early 30s and begin to drop after that. A recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Stanford University revealed a similar spike in age-related issues among men in their 40s, including weaker bones and poorer metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

They are normally found inside tumors, trying to eliminate cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When cancer cells grow and multiply, they can overcome these cells, keeping them from effectively performing their cancer-fighting role. The goal of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, or TIL therapy, is to get rid of the cancer cells by blocking the bad cells and unleashing immune cells from the patient's own body to attack the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In June 2024, shortly after Konkol received his cancer diagnosis, the Froedtert &amp;amp; MCW Cancer Networkbecame the only center in the state certified and one of 80 approved centers nationwide to provide &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-lifileucel-unresectable-or-metastatic-melanoma" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lifileucel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The drug is manufactured by &lt;a href="https://www.iovance.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Iovance Biotherapeutics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Froedtert &amp;amp; MCW were involved in the phase two clinical trials, with three patients receiving the treatment. Konkol is the first patient to receive the treatment in Wisconsin who is not involved in a clinical trial. Two others have since received treatment, with a third scheduled to begin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Patients like Konkol who qualify for the therapy must first undergo seven consecutive days of chemotherapy, similar to what is done to patients prior to a bone marrow transplant, said Harker-Murray, who oversaw the drug's clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The goal of that chemotherapy is to clear out a patient's immune cells within their own body and bone marrow to make room for the TIL product,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once the seven days of chemotherapy are completed, the patient is admitted to Froedtert's bone marrow transplant unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Then, similar to a blood transfusion, a newly grown batch of the patient's own lymphocytes is infused back into the patient's bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once the infusion is completed, the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit and given up to six doses of a hormone that spurs the growth of the lymphocyte cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Once they are in the bloodstream, they just know what to do," Harker-Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If all goes as planned, the robust number of newly grown lymphocytes will overpower the cancer cells, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The patient experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Cancer patients must meet certain criteria to be a candidate for the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They need to have stage 4 cancer or a tumor that cannot be completely removed by surgery that has progressed, despite receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Candidates cannot have active, untreated spots of brain cancer. They need to pass a pulmonary test and a cardiac stress test if they have had prior heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And the pace at which their cancer is spreading can’t be too quick, Harker-Murray said, since the process takes two to three months, including the time for the drug manufacturer to grow the new, healthy cancer-fighting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Candidates must also have one melanoma spot at least 1.5 to 4 cm in size to take to remove as a lymph node sample and at least one other spot of cancer visible on a CT scan, which allows doctors to monitor the therapy’s effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Konkol met the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Patients have to stay relatively close to the hospital during the first 28 days, as patients experience the standard chemotherapy side effects that follow a bone marrow transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Konkols decided the best option for them was to stay at &lt;a href="https://kathys-house.org/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Kathy's House&lt;/a&gt; for most of Rusty's care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Located one block from the hospital's cancer clinic, the facility allows patients of all ages who are receiving treatment at a nearby hospital to stay for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Meals are provided and some insurances cover the cost to stay. Otherwise, a one bedroom is $50 per night and a two-bedroom suite is $60. Financial assistance is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Kathy's House is a godsend," Lynn Konkel said.

Others contain so much sugar, fat and artificial additives that they can seem like glorified candy bars, said Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGSGMZN56RERFDKD3QND6YDFWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some top-selling protein bars contain emulsifiers and synthetic preservatives — such as  &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6" target="_blank"&gt;polysorbate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6" target="_blank"&gt;carboxymethyl cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590883/" target="_blank"&gt;butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9003278/" target="_blank"&gt;sodium benzoate&lt;/a&gt; — that have been linked to gut inflammation and various health problems. At the same time, plenty of protein bars are laden with artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes such as erythritol, sucralose and acesulfame potassium that have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10822749/" target="_blank"&gt;associated with a heightened risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DHWPACVKRBAFJBKOH56IKV55MI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To help you find the healthiest options, we analyzed hundreds of protein bars and interviewed dietitians and nutrition experts. They said that whenever possible, you should always prioritize getting your protein from real food,  such as plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese,  hard-boiled eggs, nuts and sliced turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZPBKOJJNJBZDLL3SRPUVOGXPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it’s fine to have a protein bar several times a week for convenience, said Zumpano, especially if the alternative is junk food. “I would rather someone choose a protein bar over a bag of chips from a vending machine,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORVLGL64Q5CYBM7NW47A2ZUTK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what you should avoid when choosing protein bars — and better ingredients and brands to seek out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OE4CYN6OBBGWBLTFPGNJLD7EKM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OE4CYN6OBBGWBLTFPGNJLD7EKM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Avoid these red flags&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="KP3OUQZT3NCCHNCBHFIJUNWBCA" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hyvuql-isBold-true wpds-c-esEUdQ-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KP3OUQZT3NCCHNCBHFIJUNWBCA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Excessive amounts of added sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWZZ3HQ3VZBQRNUFSNJ3AT4JOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s okay to eat protein bars that are lightly sweetened with such things as dates and honey, especially if you exercise, said Amy Stephens, a sports dietitian at New York University. Carbohydrates replenish your body’s glycogen stores and help your body use protein to build muscle, she added. But you should avoid bars that are loaded with added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJ37L5SL6FGXHPEVPG6C7G5IU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a general rule, look for bars that have an added sugar content that is less than half the total amount of carbs, Stephens said. If a bar has 20 grams of carbs, for example, then it should contain less than 10 grams of added sugar. If it has more than that, it’s best to find another option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5SY2LBP7RERXKSD7VE64NXXLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Don’t be duped by bars that claim they have little or no sugar. In many cases, these bars are made with artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes. “If a protein bar has one gram of sugar but it’s loaded with artificial sweeteners then I would not consider that healthier than a protein bar that has just a little honey or dates in it for sweetness,” said Zumpano at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZA7555TYCNESTGPN26NOVJFP3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amount of sugar you’d be cutting from your diet is likely minimal anyway, and research suggests that sugar substitutes may&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have surprising side effects. Some have been &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/9/1681/153434/Artificial-Sweeteners-and-Risk-of-Type-2-Diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, said Allison Sylvetsky, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. “That raises the question of whether they really are helpful or not,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TGUKWMPMPVAIXGNJWPUFMJYHJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Common sugar substitutes in protein bars include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="2NWJO3P6YZE2DGG3754LUJEZBM" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sugar alcohols&lt;/b&gt; such as erythritol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/b&gt;  such as sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame potassium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Natural” sweeteners&lt;/b&gt; such as stevia, allulose and monk fruit extract. These low and no-calorie sweeteners are derived from plants, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re better for you, Sylvetsky said. “There’s a consumer perception that they’re healthier because they’re from plants,” she added. “But there’s not much evidence to support that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FQJDFY5AP5E4VC2YI7UW2C7DQE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FQJDFY5AP5E4VC2YI7UW2C7DQE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to pick a healthier protein bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="SWZZ3HQ3VZBQRNUFSNJ3AT4JOA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;High quality protein&lt;/b&gt;: Look for proteins such as egg whites and dairy, which may be listed as casein or whey protein. “These contain all the essential amino acids that your body can’t make and that you need for muscle growth,” Stephens said. If you’re vegan, look for plant proteins like soy and pea protein. “These are also great sources of protein,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;At least 10 grams of protein&lt;/b&gt;: Choose bars that have between 10 and 20 grams of protein. “That’s a decent amount,” Zumpano said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fiber&lt;/b&gt;: Eating fiber &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/09/17/secrets-to-successful-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;helps keep you full&lt;/a&gt; and satiated, and it nourishes your gut microbiome. Look for bars that have about 3 to 5 grams of fiber per serving, Zumpano said. But the more the better. “If a bar has more than 5 grams of fiber, that’s great,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole food ingredients&lt;/b&gt;: Choose bars that are made from “real food” ingredients such as oats, seeds, egg whites, dates, almonds and peanuts. “The ingredients should be things that you can pronounce and recognize,” Stephens said. “If you’re not really sure what an ingredient is, it’s likely something that’s highly processed and that might not be good for your health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BL7XOAKGHVEIXJEWBSFYG5EXXU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BL7XOAKGHVEIXJEWBSFYG5EXXU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The healthiest protein bars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHM4J7TXB5BKVJ5GSGY2QPKXT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://aloha.com/collections/" target="_blank"&gt;These bars&lt;/a&gt; are relatively low in sugar, high in fiber and have a good amount of protein. Most of the bars have 14 grams of protein and in some cases as much as 10 grams of fiber. That’s roughly a third of the recommended daily fiber intake for adults. The bars are made with mostly simple ingredients, such as almonds, rolled oats, brown rice protein, cashew butter and chocolate chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2NIXL6YHNHM5FIR7SOHATCZPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The ingredients are awesome, and the bars are plant-based,” Stephens said. They’re available in at least 21 flavors,  including almond butter cup, blueberry, chocolate caramel pecan, and chocolate chip cookie dough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMLBW2Y3VVCLLH4CV2XLXDLTP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.trubar.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoprIJf2ehASiwZ7cVYORz5YXs15YhZrkAPugUsFlYDwAo2-K97j" target="_blank"&gt;These bars&lt;/a&gt; contain 12 grams of protein and large amounts of fiber — up to 14 grams per bar, which is about half your recommended daily amount of fiber. They’re relatively low in added sugars compared to other bars, and they’re not artificially sweetened.

They contain 12 grams of protein, four to six grams of fiber, and 14 to 17 grams of sugar. While these bars are generally on the sweeter side, their sugar content comes from the dates and other dried fruits — not from table sugar, corn syrup or other added sugars. “These bars can be great in the afternoon for a quick snack,” Stephens said. “I like them because they have a moderate amount of protein and ingredients that you can recognize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PWKS55WZHFDKJMJV4CPMWDCKR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another good option are &lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/minis-variety-pack-1680840075.html" target="_blank"&gt;RXBAR Minis&lt;/a&gt;, which contain about half the calories and total sugar of the regular RXBARs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5VQKKC56PFGGVCL4FC554EPSWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://allrealnutrition.com/products/ultimate-pack" target="_blank"&gt;Each bar&lt;/a&gt; contains 12 or fewer ingredients, including grass-fed milk protein. They also have more protein — 16 grams — than a lot of other bars we analyzed. They’re high in fiber and contain little or no added sugar, and they’re made from real-food ingredients  such as peanuts, dates, almonds, cocoa, chicory fiber and coconut. They’re available in nine&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;flavors, and they come in plastic-free packaging, including compostable wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VY7DIK667RHULKMXTKV2XFSRMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/" target="_blank"&gt;These vegan protein bars&lt;/a&gt; contain a lot of nutritious whole-food ingredients, such as organic almond butter, organic rolled oats, organic sunflower seed butter, and a blend of organic plant proteins. They’re slightly sweeter than some other protein bars, with around 7 to 13 grams of added sugar per bar. But they also have a decent amount of protein (10 to 12 grams) and fiber (2 to 3 grams) per bar. They’re available in 15 flavors, and they’re gluten-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IMQ3WJLZ3VG4HPLKBY4NDP7XHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We recommend their &lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/white-chocolate-macadamia-nuts/" target="_blank"&gt;“Celestial Delight” protein bar&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with white chocolate and macadamia nuts. It has one of the best nutrition profiles of any GoMacro bar, with 12 grams of protein, 7 grams of added sugar and 2 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5DVYU7APTRDK5NBZFTHAXDJBXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The main ingredient in &lt;a href="https://88acres.com/collections/protein-bars" target="_blank"&gt;these bars&lt;/a&gt; is pumpkin seeds. But they contain a lot of other wholesome ingredients, including sunflower seeds, cherries, bananas, dark chocolate and cinnamon. Each bar has 12 grams of protein, and they come in a variety of flavors,  such as banana bread, dark chocolate brownie and chocolate chip blondie. They’re also allergy-friendly: They’re vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and made without wheat, soy, eggs and other top allergens, making them&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a good choice for people with food allergies and sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YWVZKHNWNVFVFDH4OFAF7YYGPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most protein bars are sweet.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But these Paleo-friendly &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bars" target="_blank"&gt;Epic bars&lt;/a&gt; are a good choice for people who want a savory option that’s not plant-based. They’re made from a handful of whole-food ingredients such as bison, pork, grass-fed beef and venison, along with a variety of spices and seasonings. They’re slightly lower in protein than other bars — ranging from about 7 to 13 grams of protein per bar — but they’re also fairly low in fat, sugar and calories, Stephens said. One caveat is that some of the flavors are high in sodium. We recommend the &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/bisonbaconcranberrybar" target="_blank"&gt;Bison Bacon Cranberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/beefaplebaconbar" target="_blank"&gt;Beef Uncured Bacon + Apple&lt;/a&gt; bars, which are among the flavors that are lowest in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WJVUXMNH7ZADFOLXS3DVPGQJLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some other good protein options from Epic are their “&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bites/products/salmon-maple-coconut-oil-bites" target="_blank"&gt;salmon bites&lt;/a&gt;” made from wild Alaskan salmon, and their “&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips" target="_blank"&gt;snack strips&lt;/a&gt;” made from &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/wagyu-beef-steak-strips" target="_blank"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/smoked-salmon-maple-fillet-strips" target="_blank"&gt;wild salmon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFRMWE2CYBFWBJFDHA3F6XO5KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Picky Bar company was founded by a group of professional endurance athletes. Their &lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars" target="_blank"&gt;protein bars&lt;/a&gt; contain a mixture of plant proteins, healthy fats and complex carbs thanks to such ingredients  as nut butters, dried fruit, oats and seeds. Their protein bars have 10 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 2 to 6 grams of added sugar. They also fit a variety of dietary restrictions: They’re vegan and gluten, dairy and soy-free. They come in two flavors: “&lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars/products/apple-cinnawin" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Cinnawin&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars/products/peanut-chocolate-champ" target="_blank"&gt;Peanut Chocolate Champ&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

And yes, in theory, those microorganisms can be spread to other eaters. But in most cases, that might not be as risky as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GTBHS6G4Y5HQZKRQYO6SZB47YI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers at Clemson University &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2008.00137.x" target="_blank"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that there were more bacteria in double-dipped situations compared with the single-dipped. In a series of experiments, the team analyzed how many bacteria were transferred from a bitten cracker into a cup of sterile water compared with an unbitten cracker. They found that if someone had taken a bite before dipping, the water contained significantly more bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KM225OHDHJBHLLQZYLT2GHN3BU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, the researchers reported that the type of food mattered.

Respiratory illnesses such as these are much more commonly spread by coughing and sneezing around people at a party than by eating or drinking after them, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D6W7N6PRN5CKHMILFVTAGHCI34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One strong exception is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/30/why-are-norovirus-cases-rising/" target="_blank"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;.

After some good therapy, I no longer need this type of validation and feel uncomfortable with how much detail she expects to know about my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb71nqy600583b77wqqsqkxr@published"&gt;Without the minutiae of my life to talk about, we don’t seem to have much in common. Our conversation usually veers into talking about our other mutual friends, which also makes me uncomfortable since I know she is doing the same about me with them. I can’t help but feel guilty about “abandoning her now that I don’t need her,” but I feel stressed every time we hang out. I have been trying to slowly phase out the friendship by seeing her less, but she keeps hitting me up, and I feel weird completely ignoring her. Am I wrong to throw away a long friendship? Do I leave her on read, or should I explicitly ask for space? Without making plans to see each other, we would not run into each other for a long while.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask her if she’s still playing pickleball and if she likes it. Ask her if that one co-worker she mentioned still makes weird faces during Zoom meetings. Ask her if she can recommend any good true crime documentaries, what she thinks Beyoncé’s next album will be like, and whether she wants to come with you to return something to Sephora and help you choose a new foundation. Take the reins of the conversation and talk about things that don’t involve the details of your life or criticizing your friends, and see if you enjoy her more. She might have interesting things to say! And if your relationship has been mostly defined by her probing into your deepest, darkest feelings, it’s no wonder you haven’t heard them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywj3h001d3b77dyuwqisd@published"&gt;I’ve been in your shoes before, really dreading the conversations I had with a particular person. It was a revelation when it hit me that I didn’t just have to sit there and let them decide what we’d talk about. Instead, I could get ahead of their predictable and annoying content by shaping the exchange into something that I wanted to have. You might be pleased to realize, like I was, that your friend is not actually attached to the kinds of talks you normally have. Maybe she’s just operating out of habit, or doesn’t have any other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

You can pair this with thanking her for all the ways in which she’s been there for you and shown interest in your life. Tell her that while you want to take some space, you will still show up for her if she needs you.&lt;/p&gt;

She really fought to beat it, but it was just too much for her in the end. Going through that opened my eyes to how easy it is for disordered eating to get passed off as being “health-conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy73001q3b7733mx3xyh@published"&gt;Now that I’m in my 30s, I’ve been seeing a lot of guys my age getting really obsessed with dieting and weight. Most of the time, I try to ignore it, but I’m getting worried about my friend “James.” A few years ago, he started this super strict diet, and it just seems to get more extreme over time. He talks about “toxins” a lot, and it feels like he’s always changing what he’s eating or doing, but never really explains why. I also see how he’s started working out differently. He’s way more focused on it than before—and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone else just praises him for getting “cut” at 32, but I think it’s going too far. I don’t know if he sees it, and I just don’t want him to end up like my ex.&lt;/p&gt;

It might ease your mind a bit to remind yourself that, unfortunately, a lot of people do experience disordered relationships with eating and exercise, and while it’s certainly very dangerous, it doesn’t always end in tragedy. But if your assessment of James’s escalating obsession with his diet and body is accurate, you’re still right to be concerned and to share that with him.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy75001v3b77o64ce7qr@published"&gt;Does he know about your history? If so, I’m hopeful that he’d be understanding—even if he doesn’t change his behavior in response—about your concerns. The key here will be to be totally transparent, just like you were in your letter, explaining that you know it’s not your place to scrutinize his eating and exercise habits. Then explain that you have a heightened sensitivity to the way restrictive practices can spiral and have become worried about him. To avoid offending him or causing him to become defensive, you want to make sure to include the sentences, “I could be totally off base here,” “I hope this isn’t annoying,” and, “I just really care about you.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy76001w3b77xl7krhd9@published"&gt;I have to warn you that he has this approach to diet and exercise for a reason, whether it’s a healthy one or an unhealthy one. Something about the restriction, the way his body looks, or the fantasy of the way his body will look if he tweaks just one more thing is likely making him feel the way he wants to feel right now, or helping him to avoid feelings he doesn’t want to experience. That’s a powerful force. Plus, diet culture is so widespread and normalized that even if he’s really overdoing it, he can easily tell himself he’s just taking care of his body. So your mini-intervention may not change his behavior. But one day in the future, it could be one of many things that inspires him to reevaluate what he’s doing. Plus, if this is bothering you, there’s something to be said for being honest and open with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s valuable even if he doesn’t immediately take a rest day and eat a carb.&lt;/p&gt;

She left a large part of her estate to my two nephews and “Maya,” the daughter of her best friend, “Josie.” I have control over the trust, and it states that the money should be used for educational purposes. It isn’t a problem since my nephews are both college age, but Maya is still in elementary school. Tragically, Josie died last year. I went to the funeral but only had sporadic contact with the family until recently. Josie’s widower has been increasingly calling me about Maya’s money.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6yxbnj002a3b77kc1nhzsw@published"&gt;It has gone from plausible (paying for dance lessons) to impossible (her day camp will only accept cash, and he will give it to them). The last conversation had him threatening me. It left me very shaken, and I am wondering about what to do next. I love and miss my sister, but I was never close to Josie or Maya. I really don’t want to deal with this for the next decade. Is it wrong to just dump Maya’s portion in a 529 plan and be done with it? The trust allows me to.&lt;/p&gt;

But check in with a lawyer/financial planner about the trust to hammer out the details. I do worry that the 529 plan won’t provide you the foolproof relief from never interfacing with this man again that you’re seeking. You’ll want to ask a professional about what your options are for dealing with this difficult widower and safeguarding Maya’s money, while simultaneously giving yourself the peace of mind you want and &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 64-year-old woman in Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient visited a medical clinic to seek care for her &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1015/p500.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1015/p500.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic rhinosinusitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — tissue inflammation in the sinuses and nasal passages — that was causing a viscous discharge containing mucus and pus to persistently drip down the back of her throat. She also reported headaches accompanying the postnasal drip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman told physicians at the clinic that 23 years earlier she underwent &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sinus-surgery" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sinus-surgery" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endoscopic surgery for chronic sinus infections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which typically involves removing blockages from the sinuses with the help of a tube-shaped scope. But after the procedure, she continued to experience thick and discolored mucus, which was somewhat relieved by rinsing with antibiotics and saline. She continued this irrigation regimen for eight years, stopping two years before seeking help at the clinic. (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2833827" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2833827" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't note why she stopped the rinses.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors collected a mucus sample from one of the patient's sinus cavities for analysis. In addition, when they cleared out the accumulated mucus from her sinuses, they discovered something unexpected: bony lumps on the walls of the sinus cavities on either side of her nose. Their abundance in the woman's sinuses gave her sinus walls "a cobblestone appearance," the doctors wrote in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; A lab analysis of the mucus sample revealed that the woman had a bacterial infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a bacterial species often found in healthcare settings that can be resistant to antibiotics. The cobblestone growths were "exostoses" — benign, bone tumors that often form as layers in ear canal tissue after repeated exposure to cold water. They are sometimes seen in a condition known as "surfer's ear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors treated the woman's bacterial infection using sinus rinses with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentamicin-injection-route/description/drg-20074471" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentamicin-injection-route/description/drg-20074471" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gentamicin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful antibiotic, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/budesonide-nasal-route/description/drg-20074729" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/budesonide-nasal-route/description/drg-20074729" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;budesonide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a steroid that reduces inflammation. After the patient's symptoms subsided, she was switched to warm saline rinses and told to avoid cold water to prevent more bony lesions from developing. Her symptoms did not return, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors determined that the existing exostoses were not responsible for the woman's rhinosinusitis and were unlikely to cause future sinus problems. Therefore, the growths did not require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Since the 1930s, exostoses in the ear canal have been associated with surfing and other water activities that involve prolonged, repeated immersion in cold water. Researchers have hypothesized that these bony growths are a protective response of the ear canal's vascular tissue, which lacks a layer of insulating fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinus tissue also lacks a layer of fatty insulation, making it similarly vulnerable to the formation of bony growths. The patient's exostoses were likely caused by years of sinus irrigation with cold liquid, according to the report. While this development in the sinuses is rare compared to surfer's ear, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753257/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753257/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;several&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openneuroimagingjournal.com/VOLUME/6/PAGE/90/ABSTRACT/" target="_blank" data-url="https://openneuroimagingjournal.com/VOLUME/6/PAGE/90/ABSTRACT/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involving exostoses in the sinus cavities have been described in the medical literature — and they usually involved repeated cold-water nasal rinses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6-RatgQ4RVZ2v3nP7I2JMW6kdQZ0v4dqBG" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6-RatgQ4RVZ2v3nP7I2JMW6kdQZ0v4dqBG slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6p1v29000xs4m4ho7o7zau@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please bleed more&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, looking at my pricked finger. A drop of blood dangled at its tip, not quite big enough to fall. I needed enough blood to fill a small circle outlined on a piece of paper. Taking a little sample at home had sounded simple when I had ordered this test kit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su53h00083b73eowgr9qp@published"&gt;“Everyone bleeds differently,” the man on my laptop screen said. I had booked a support call to make sure I did everything right. &lt;em&gt;Apparently I’m not good at bleeding&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. “You can use another finger,” the man added encouragingly. “That’s why there are four needles.” I clenched my teeth, aimed the flat triangular needle, and pricked again.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su56r00093b73chky4p7w@published"&gt;At last, after three pricked fingers, I managed to fill the paper outline with red. Staring down at the circle of hard-earned blood, I wondered: &lt;em&gt;How much plastic is in there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su59n000a3b73d0dm31j5@published"&gt;All the effort was for a &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/microplastics-test?variant=49128651161885"&gt;microplastics blood test&lt;/a&gt;, the first designed to be taken at home. Testing human blood for microplastics is a relatively new thing. Until this home test came out, the process could be done only at scientific research labs, which is not exactly an accessible option for most people. Microplastics are tiny pieces that routinely shed off plastic things we use, like water bottles and synthetic clothing. Over time, they break down, occasionally becoming small enough to &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02317"&gt;test the limits&lt;/a&gt; of our measuring abilities. These microplastics are in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8520475/"&gt;air we breathe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9920460/"&gt;food we eat&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772224000640"&gt;water we drink&lt;/a&gt;. So they’re also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81931-9"&gt;in our blood&lt;/a&gt; and can even travel to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9953450/"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11342020/"&gt;other organs&lt;/a&gt;. “Basically, anywhere you look in the human body, you find them,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/Phil-Landrigan.html"&gt;Philip Landrigan&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and public health physician who has researched plastics and health. Perhaps you’ve heard about the study that found that the brain can contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness"&gt;as much plastic as there is in a disposable spoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5c7000b3b73xqefcabi@published"&gt;Perhaps you have also heard of &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/about"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the entrepreneur behind the test kit I was trying out, whose maxim is “&lt;a href="https://dontdie.bryanjohnson.com/"&gt;Don’t Die&lt;/a&gt;.” He’s famous for his attempts to reverse aging, including &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/23/bryan-johnson-tech-ceo-spends-2-million-year-young-swapping-blood-17-year-old-son-talmage-70-father/"&gt;injecting his son’s blood into his body&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XypgGeD7gBk"&gt;more recently&lt;/a&gt;, removing all the plasma in his body to “replace it with very clean stuff.” The routine &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/blueprint-protocol"&gt;he shares online&lt;/a&gt; includes nearly 20 daily supplement pills. Through his company &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorfW2a1NsGvpn7nBjlbZXz6-BoMgzC873ZtlrFkGnbfhxsPyrey"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/a&gt;, he sells products based on his regimen, like the $150 microplastics test kit, to people who share his hopes of longevity. “As part of my protocol, I began testing everything that was going into my body: food, water, air and everything else,” Johnson shared in an email. “I learned through testing that we are surrounded by toxins.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5eq000c3b73ognyp6dk@published"&gt;Johnson routinely measures everything from his &lt;a href="https://mitohealth.com/blog/the-11-biomarkers-bryan-johnson-tracks-to-live-longer#:~:text=%F0%9F%93%89%20Ideal%3A%20%3C%205.2,cancer%2C%20and%20dementia"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/i-have-the-world-s-slowest-speed-of-aging?"&gt;his DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-methylation"&gt;natural genetic change&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00462-6"&gt;estimate the pace of aging&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests that everyone else get tested too (though I doubt many will compete with his claim of being “&lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/about#blueprint-bryan"&gt;the most biologically measured person in history&lt;/a&gt;”). But even as microplastics were becoming a familiar health concern, there was no test on the market for regular consumers. Johnson decided to change that. “A lot of people want to measure their levels of microplastics and it’s never been possible. Things that get measured, improve,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5he000d3b73q9g1iyvf@published"&gt;Having microplastics in the human body does not sound good. To better understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this isn’t good, I called up Heather Leslie. She’s a scientist &lt;a href="https://www.heather-leslie.com/"&gt;who does consulting&lt;/a&gt; on environmental and health issues, and she’s an expert on blood-borne plastic specifically. In 2022 she led the research team that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258"&gt;found microplastics in human blood&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Microplastics were first observed in humans &lt;a href="https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/about-us/news/detailsite/2018/news-october-2018/microplastics-detected-in-humans-for-the-first-time/"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when researchers at the Medical University of Vienna detected them in the digestive system. After that study came out, Leslie felt it was important to check the bloodstream. Finding plastic circulating there proved that it was actually absorbed by our bodies, rather than something that simply passed through us. Since then, microplastics have shot into our collective health consciousness—and knowing that we can absorb them has motivated some, myself included, to cut down on plastic use. I’ve filled my kitchen with Pyrex instead of Tupperware. I quit reusing Ziploc bags. I check clothing labels, looking for natural fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5k2000e3b739hw74936@published"&gt;But when, a month after I’d mailed in the bloodstained paper, my microplastics test results arrived, those small efforts suddenly felt meaningless. I had to set up an account on Johnson’s Don’t Die app to view the results. Although the process was simple, it gave me time to become slightly apprehensive and to hope for a low microplastics count. Instead, my small circle of blood had 39—&lt;em&gt;39!&lt;/em&gt;—pieces of plastic in it. I had more microplastics than 77 percent of people who had taken the same test. I suspected there were even more pieces floating around in my sample, too small for this test to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5nj000f3b737dis41cq@published"&gt;Those little bits of plastic could’ve come from anywhere, really. I apply lipstick from plastic tubes. I buy plastic-wrapped fruit from the grocery store. Even my water filter, designed to remove harmful chemicals, is made of plastic. Although I know plastic is a problem, something still feels friendly about the bright-colored toothpaste tube, the crinkly bag of pasta. That’s the result of a life lived among successful ad campaigns, I guess. But putting a number to the microplastics in my blood had me starting to rethink. Suddenly, pollution felt personal. Was it time to stop buying plastic altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5qr000g3b73jhhgdunf@published"&gt;Just how microplastics affect us from the inside, and to what extent they do, is actually largely unknown. Leslie says plastic is “like spaghetti with a sauce.” The pieces of plastic are the spaghetti, and the chemicals attached to it are the sauce. Those chemical additives are what give plastic different properties, like color, stretchiness, and flame resistance. Sometimes, the chemical “sauce” leaches out of plastic, a process that, research has shown, &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report"&gt;can be toxic&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to the “spaghetti,” though, scientists don’t yet know how it affects our bodies. Microplastics could transport those harmful chemicals into humans. Then again, there are lots of ways for plastic chemicals to get inside us. (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723021527#sec5"&gt;They’re common pollutants&lt;/a&gt; on their own.) It’s difficult to determine whether certain chemicals in our bodies come from microplastics or are features of our environment. And the effects of the microplastics themselves remain unclear. Although some researchers suspect they can cause damage by physically disrupting tissues and cells, it’ll take more investigating to definitively assess their health effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="205" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5te000h3b73edyu0wzp@published"&gt;Even just getting an accurate measurement of microplastic pieces in the blood is difficult. “If you don’t use a really strong, robust, reliable, repeatable method—reproducible, all these things—then you are going to get a number out at the other end, but it might just be sort of a mythological number,” Leslie told me. Blueprint’s lab partner &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/microplastics-test?variant=49128651161885#:~:text=Our%20lab%20partner%20developed%20a%20plastic%2Dfree%20Fluorescent%20Microscopy%20(FM)%20methodology%20using%20only%20glass%2C%20metal%2C%20or%20paper%20to%20avoid%20contamination."&gt;uses a plastic-free method&lt;/a&gt; to test the blood for plastic so that it’s not contaminated during testing. But there’s no way to know whether a sample got contaminated before arriving at the testing location. Leslie notes that scientists usually use a “field blank” for lab tests: an additional sample to show whether the sampling process caused contamination. The home test’s small, single sample doesn’t allow for this safeguard. And it’s all too easy to accidentally taint a drop of blood at home. Even the alcohol wipe I cleaned my finger with could be a source of plastic if the alcohol were ever stored in a plastic container. There’s also the chance I didn’t sanitize my hands correctly. So, for all my effort to get that drop of blood out of my finger, it might not have given me a truly accurate scientific read on how much plastic I contain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5w3000i3b73gru77ku4@published"&gt;Overall, Leslie believes I shouldn’t draw health-related conclusions from the test. “For an individual result, a one-off measurement like this, we can’t really say anything about how you should be feeling today or if this is going to lead to a chronic disease.” Also, there’s no proven way to get rid of the plastics inside us. (Some experimental methods, like the &lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1884313232946651413"&gt;plasma replacement&lt;/a&gt; Johnson has tried, were listed at the end of my test results—but their effectiveness remains uncertain.) “I don’t know of any way to get them out of the human body,” said Landrigan. “It’s nice that somebody’s got a test, but one of the things that we’ve all learned in medicine is you don’t test for stuff that you can’t fix.” Landrigan notes that it is wise to reduce plastic use, as much as you can. “But I can tell you that anyway,” he said. “I don’t need to find microplastic particles in your blood to offer you that advice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5yj000j3b73kv4965rc@published"&gt;Taking the test did motivate me to find more ways to minimize plastic in my life. (The results also came with tips for reducing exposure.) I found a cotton cover for my synthetic mattress. I’m on the lookout for natural fiber sponges. Yet … I’ve noticed that even these nonplastic products are often sold in plastic packaging. I’ve also realized that I’m not ready for the expense and effort of an extremely plastic-free lifestyle. While I aspire to buy only fresh, unbagged produce and to replace all my synthetic clothes, the fact is that those alternatives are pricey, and avoiding anything with plastic in it is simply out of my budget.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su618000k3b73lyr0afch@published"&gt;And even if I never so much as touched plastic again, I’d still be breathing, eating, and drinking countless bits of it too small to see. In a plastic-obsessed society, reducing exposure is only getting harder. In the past 15 years, the world has produced half of the plastic ever made, and production is still speeding up. A global plastics treaty &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/un-sets-date-extra-session-finalize-plastics-treaty-2025-03-03/"&gt;is being negotiated&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear if it’ll lead to meaningful action to reduce the plastic in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su63t000l3b7333dhp62y@published"&gt;All of that makes the test, and my results, basically just a fun little story to tell about that time there were almost 40 pieces of plastic in a couple of drops of my blood. Maybe it’s the perfect anecdote to share the next time I’m at a party, holding a plastic &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;cup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://drhyman.com/blogs/content/this-oil-change-could-add-years-to-your-life-the-fascinating-science-of-plasmapheresis?_pos=1&amp;amp;_psq=plasma&amp;amp;_ss=e&amp;amp;_v=1.0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;anti-aging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.instagram.com/bryanjohnson_/p/DBKcPUVygMa/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;influencers&lt;/a&gt;, along with a handful of scientists, believe exchanging the plasma in your blood can do a similar thing for humans to help slow biological aging. The procedure is currently offered for thousands of dollars a session at many &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/well/longevity-health-clinics.html" title=""&gt;longevity clinics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In a car, “you change the oil every 3,000 miles because it clears out debris," said Dr. Eric Verdin, the president and chief executive of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. Your blood, he said, can also accumulate potentially damaging particles that can be flushed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70103" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;first trials&lt;/a&gt; examining plasma exchange for anti-aging in humans, published Tuesday in the journal Aging Cell, offers early evidence that it may be able to slow the biological breakdown that comes with age, even in otherwise healthy people. The small study of 42 participants, with an average age of 65, found that those who got plasma exchange therapy over the course of a few months had lower concentrations in their blood of the biological compounds that accumulate with age, compared with a control group. The trial was sponsored by Circulate Health, a plasma exchange startup, and coauthored by Dr. Verdin, a company co-founder and head of the scientific advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, many other scientists who study plasma exchange are skeptical. Its anti-aging benefits for healthy people have “never been proven" in large clinical trials, said Dr. Katayoun Fomani, an associate professor and medical director of the blood bank at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and drawing blood and replacing plasma with added fluids could put patients at risk for unnecessary medical complications without a clear payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4b4401f4"&gt;How does the procedure work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Plasma exchange is a well-established treatment for certain blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and neurological conditions, and it’s typically covered by insurance when deemed medically necessary. It is not covered for anti-aging purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;During the therapy, a provider — typically a registered nurse or a technician — hooks the patient up to a machine that draws out blood. The machine separates and discards the plasma from the blood, replaces it with donor plasma or a substitute fluid, then returns the blood back to the patient. The substitute fluid often contains a mixture of saline and proteins, like albumin; in some cases, an infusion of antibodies or drugs may also be added to boost the immune system or fight certain diseases.

Kennedy Jr.’s unilateral decision that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;would no longer recommend Covid-19 boosters&lt;/a&gt; for healthy people during childhood or pregnancy represents a bulldozing of safeguards intended to keep public health officials honest and their decisions transparent. It also tramples on individuals’ ability to make their own decisions about medical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision is deeply and maddeningly ironic, because Kennedy and other top figures in the Department of Health and Human Services are shaped by grievances about how their predecessors behaved during the Covid pandemic. At the time, they railed against decisions that they said were made without medical evidence or the consultation of important experts. Yet Tuesday’s decision to change the CDC vaccine recommendations, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/"&gt;new policy made last week&lt;/a&gt; about the way Covid shots would be regulated, takes these mistakes and amplifies them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of slowing medicine’s pendulum so that it might eventually stop at a point of truth, Kennedy, the health secretary, is now swinging it so wildly that patients and doctors can do nothing but cover their heads and duck as medicine becomes more and more vulnerable to politicized extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As we enter the colder months in Australia, COVID is &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; designated NB.1.8.1 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you need to know about this new variant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The current COVID situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was initially declared a pandemic, we’re still experiencing regular waves of infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/news-data/covid-statistics/"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt; suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAIN-Aust-COVID-19-Stats-worksheet-2025.xlsx-18.pdf"&gt;ticking upwards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;among the circulating strains&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250517.pdf"&gt;generally increasing&lt;/a&gt;. Of cases sequenced &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;up to May 6&lt;/a&gt; across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia &lt;a href="https://www.health.wa.gov.au/articles/a_e/coronavirus/covid19-wastewater-surveillance"&gt;has determined NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;collected in Perth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;late April 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences – up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia – it was the dominant variant in &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md"&gt;Hong Kong and China&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Lara Herrero, created using BioRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where does this variant come from?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;collected in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-hybrid-covid-strain-behind-vietnams-latest-wave-not-exactly-161879"&gt;Recombinant&lt;/a&gt;” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image to the right shows more specifically how NB.1.8.1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170225000395"&gt;came about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;a suite of mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us – specifically via the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"&gt;ACE2 receptors&lt;/a&gt;, a “doorway” to our cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;mutations include&lt;/a&gt; T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It’s early days for this variant, so we don’t have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested – suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1922810251503362351"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;LP.8.1.1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it’s possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-in-cases-recently-symptoms-associated-with-it/photostory/121373694.cms"&gt;symptoms of NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;COVID is continuing to evolve.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/coronavirus-2019ncov-virus-background-disease-cells-1712110216"&gt;Joannii/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How about the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia’s winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated COVID boosters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if neutralising antibody levels &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;are modestly reduced&lt;/a&gt; against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current COVID vaccines should still &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;protect against severe disease&lt;/a&gt; with this variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;targets JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another COVID booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;if you’re eligible&lt;/a&gt;. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, COVID can still be a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;

health officials announced last week that pertussis - perhaps better known as whooping cough - is on the rise in the popular tourist hotspot at a 'worrying rate,' &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/hi/hawaii/news/2025/05/22/whooping-cough-cases-increase-in-hawaii"&gt;according to Spectrum Local News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of May 15, the state had already recorded 108 cases this year - surpassing last year's total cases of 84, the State of Hawaii Department of Health reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It called whooping cough a 'highly contagious respiratory disease' that spreads from bacteria through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, the symptoms can resemble a cold - but they can quickly progress to 'intense coughing fits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, those fits could be followed by a 'deep breath' that makes a 'whooping sound' due to clogged airways that are not fully formed,&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/american-honeymoon-hotspot-hit-highly-contagious-illness-health-officials-warn"&gt; Fox News reports. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Complications from the disease 'can be serious and even life-threatening, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated,' health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those complications can include pneumonia, seizures, apnea, encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) - and even possibly death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pertussis - perhaps better known as whooping cough - is on the rise in one American state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of May 15, Hawaii  had already recorded 108 cases this year  - surpassing last year's total cases of 84&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Pertussis is insidious and can be easily mistaken for other respiratory diseases - including viruses,' Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel warned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that whooping cough - which is a bacterial infection - can be treated with routine antibiotics but it is 'easily missed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best protection is vaccination, including repeated boosters in teens and adults,' Siegel suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DTaP (diptheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine is administered to children under the age of seven, while the Tdap (tetanus, diptheria and pertussis) vaccine is available for older children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neha Pathak, WebMD chief physician editor, told Fox News that about 98 out of 100 children who get the DTaP vaccine are protected from the diseases for at least one year after a fifth dose and about 70 percent are still protected up to five years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also said she suggests pregnant woman get the Tdap jab during their third trimester to pass antibodies onto their newborns who are too young to get the DTaP vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawaii health officials called whooping cough a 'highly contagious respiratory disease' that spreads from bacteria through the air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Siegel further claimed that DTaP is 'highly effective' in children with nearly 100 percent protection with appropriate dosages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, multiple doses are also generally recommended for infants, children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in Hawaii, health officials say vaccination rates 'for all routinely-recommended vaccinations for school entry - including those for measles, pertussis, polio and varicella (chicken pox)' have declined since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its vaccination levels are now even below the national average, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/22/whooping-cough-cases-surge-hawaii/"&gt;according to Hawaii News Now. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The uptick in pertussis cases is concerning, but not surprising given what we are seeing with vaccine hesitancy,' Pathak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors say the best way to prevent pertussis is by getting routine vaccinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, the rise in pertussis cases in Hawaii comes as experts warn &lt;span&gt;America is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7109605/US-measles-caseload-surpasses-1-000-health-officials-announce.html"&gt;poised for a measles explosion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; if vaccine rates continue to fall at their current pace. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research from Stanford University estimates that just a five percent decline in coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) would lead to an estimated 5.7 million measles cases and at least 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's the equivalent of 228,000 cases and 320 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in a devastating scenario, a 50 percent decline in vaccinations could flood the country with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691635/Americas-measles-outbreak-reaches-terrifying-milestone-96-infected-common.html"&gt;the life-threatening disease&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to 51 million cases, including 10.3 million hospitalizations and between 151,200 and 164,700 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For context, the US has confirmed 5,567 measles cases over the past 25 years, averaging 223 per year. In 2019 alone, there were nearly 1,300 cases; in 2020, just 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If rates stay where they are, the US could &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7403205/There-reasonable-chance-lose-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;lose its measles elimination status within two decades.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Stanford research projects that if vaccinations dip by just five percent, the case count of measles could jump to 5.7 million with 2,550 deaths over the next 25 years. In the worst-case scenario, if vaccination coverage were to plummet by 50 percent, cases could exceed 51 million with between 150,000 and 164,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US&lt;span&gt; is facing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, centered in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;Gaines and Lubbock counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, West Texas, where just 74 percent and 92 percent of children are vaccinated, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas has confirmed 728 measles cases so far, with over 400 in Gaines County alone. Two children in Texas and one in New Mexico have died. New Mexico has reported 71 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii also confirmed two cases in April, but health officials since concluded there was no further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, health officials in the Aloha State warn they are not out of the woods on that yet, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles cases in the United States continue to rise, with more than 1,000 cases already reported across 30 states this year,' they said in the news release last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risk remains high for future travel-related measles cases reaching Hawaii and DOH recommends continued vigilance efforts to increase the MMR vaccination rate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It then stressed its 'strong' recommendation for children and adults to stay up-to-date on all vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 05:37:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSU5oUVBRRUhtUG9DdXJ2VTE1dVRfRUc1OWo5V2xlcHZFanZzTmI4UGNYeWRuaU0wSEdCQVNqMHRCZk4tT0dLeGt0SmlER0x2MU5QUUNJUHl3SUdMTVJ4b0VsTm1jZVVaUEtqbmVJM2d1UXE3cWpBcTdoVm16Umc2VkpzODk4MEZqc2hfYmZpaTM2MWVLcVN3LW5ZSzRlS24taV930gGoAUFVX3lxTE5KTFdnWTI1QWhrVUViRE5UdFplUEpGcUZ2R0FGU3pkU2JUZG9QY3R1S3FWVkdFY1Y0RlB1MDlFdmw4bUFSMnZldmdLVlZpYktGaU5rQWtxZnZoSjN5Q1dqTTZsb0kzM3pzbkpmcTFzTzdjanc3cWQxa1BLZmhKQWc5SjJXRkJuOWVIOXVPUlUtaUxYTnh5TTNkN2liNlpnTjFDR1JXN2xlVQ</guid></item><item><title>我归咎于压力的早期预警迹象，实际上是我40多岁的早发性阿尔茨海默氏症-每日邮报 | Early warning signs I blamed on stress that were actually early-onset Alzheimer's in my forties - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOa25lUVNRTUdrRUlOU2tBMFkydlJOdFFFbEwxem44ZXBOZi12cndFeUI2Tl9sT2FGQUhQWXlock5JTnF0Zm5FZDB6cW9vTjhna20zSFVpNUlkeTdHWnBITjZ2TzVyLW1HaEFERzc5US1tRmVteUZZaDBqYWhra0NoUjU4MUJ1ZTY3QVlFSjk0R0x4eW1Db2JaTTV3SXNqeG1rQWE1aTBtdlVSa3Z2dUQ5blgxMmNHekJ1TzlXem5PRERRTTNOVWJxNFVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca Luna says she can't remember the previous day ‘seven to eight times out of 10.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She occasionally blacks out in the middle of conversations with friends: 'It's almost like I'm not there, it's black, and it feels blank. It's a complete nothingness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she comes to, she doesn't know what she's just said or done. The mother-of -two has also forgotten to turn the stove off and unknowingly started her car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lapses are all part of Luna's rare diagnosis: &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14485077/man-alzheimers-symptom-subtle-disease-early-onset.html"&gt;early-onset Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms began two years ago, and she started seeing psychiatrists for her memory ‘blips’, which Luna first chalked up to perimenopause or her &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-d8efc380-3b11-11f0-9bce-2b2fdcade45d"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. Luna also suffered from alcoholism for years - she is now 15 years sober - and feared her lapses could be repercussions of her addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t until a neurologist administered a two-hour cognitive test, which she failed, and took detailed MRI scans, that she learned the truth nine months ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Canadian native has grappled with the knowledge that the neurodegenerative disease will rob her of time with her children and has had to explain to them that, given her diagnosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;the mother they know her as will likely begin to disappear&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is more progressive, with a shorter life expectancy of about eight years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Luna's early-onset Alzheimer's symptoms appeared about two years ago. She would black out mid-conversation, lose her keys only to find them in her car's ignition, forget what she did the day before, and left to stove on at home for an hour before returning to find her kitchen full of smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wheredidrebeccago/video/7492897462038842629"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘It’s really hard to think about that stuff because I am in denial. So when my brain is like, let’s look at the facts, sometimes I look at my neurology documentation with all the scientific facts – they’re not just out of nowhere, they’re not perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have to look at that stuff to make it real for myself because I just love gaslighting myself… It is a progressive illness. We’re catching it super early, which is amazing, but there is no cure.’  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna had noticed a growing number of troubling instances over around two years in which she couldn’t remember doing basic, everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, she returned to her car in the gym parking lot and realized she couldn’t find her keys. She checked around and underneath the car and even looked on the roof, thinking she had left them there like she'd done in the past with her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, she realized: the car was running, and the keys were in the ignition. She had already gotten in the car and turned it on but it didn't register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My car was on that whole time.

Doctors also check for memory, language, and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She failed all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months ago, when she went to a neurologist for specialized care to confirm what the tests had found, she underwent a more expansive series of tests assessing her memory, attention, language, reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each test in the neurological evaluation has its own scoring system based on what is normal for a person's age beyond just looking at whether the patient scored high or low on a test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end, the doctor reviews all of the individual test scores to spot certain patterns, such as an usually low memory score with normal attention and language skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps the doctor spot signs their patient is dealing with Alzheimer's specifically, the type of dementia whose first symptom is memory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna said: ‘Then he looked at my MRIs, looked at other things noted by the psychiatrist, and he just walked in with pamphlets of early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There was no diagnosis at that time. This was his suspicion.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing, including her medial temporal atrophy (MTA) score, which is a diagnostic tool for dementia, led to a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly 7million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s is not typical Alzheimer’s disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it’s passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to administering lengthy cognitive tests, Luna's doctor took scans of her brain to document the shrinkage that had occured until then. This is not Luna's scan, but demonstrates what brain atrophy looks like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While early-onset Alzheimer's if often hereditary, Luna did not say whether she has a family history of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people with early-onset Alzheimer's often go about 1.6 years longer before getting diagnosed than those with late-onset Alzheimer's, likely because symptoms are missed or doctors take more time to evaluate younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis, Luna's family, including her daughter and mother, is in denial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘About two months ago, I sent her [my mother] the [doctor’s] clinical notes where he's put Alzheimer's on it. And she lost it then because I think she wasn't believing it until she saw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so weird. I make fun of it all the time because that's just generally who I am. I like to keep things kind of light and funny. It's important for me to make fun of myself, to keep the morale high for the people around me, but I also need it because it is so serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could totally take this and just go on an isolation/depression bender, and I do not want to do that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna began a TikTok account where she updates her 29,000 followers about her symptoms, her daily life, and her tips for self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia will rise sharply from 6.7 million in 2023 to 12.7 million by 2050, driven largely by the aging baby boomer generation, who face a higher risk of the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has found a community on the site and many helpful tips from people in the comments section enduring similar diagnoses or helping a loved one cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the best she has heard and implemented is minimizing clutter in her home, making playlists of songs that bring her back to herself, and journaling during the day, ‘because what's one of my new things is I shower and then two hours later I feel like I need to have a shower.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘If you are a loved one [of someone with Alzheimer’s], my suggestion is to meet them where they're at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What I've found really helpful with my partner is not to be questioned but reminded, and to just believe them.

It's a complete nothingness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she comes to, she doesn't know what she's just said or done. The mother-of -two has also forgotten to turn the stove off and unknowingly started her car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lapses are all part of Luna's rare diagnosis: &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14485077/man-alzheimers-symptom-subtle-disease-early-onset.html"&gt;early-onset Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms began two years ago, and she started seeing psychiatrists for her memory ‘blips’, which Luna first chalked up to perimenopause or her &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-d8efc380-3b11-11f0-9bce-2b2fdcade45d"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. Luna also suffered from alcoholism for years - she is now 15 years sober - and feared her lapses could be repercussions of her addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t until a neurologist administered a two-hour cognitive test, which she failed, and took detailed MRI scans, that she learned the truth nine months ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Canadian native has grappled with the knowledge that the neurodegenerative disease will rob her of time with her children and has had to explain to them that, given her diagnosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;the mother they know her as will likely begin to disappear&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is more progressive, with a shorter life expectancy of about eight years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Luna's early-onset Alzheimer's symptoms appeared about two years ago. She would black out mid-conversation, lose her keys only to find them in her car's ignition, forget what she did the day before, and left to stove on at home for an hour before returning to find her kitchen full of smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wheredidrebeccago/video/7492897462038842629"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘It’s really hard to think about that stuff because I am in denial. So when my brain is like, let’s look at the facts, sometimes I look at my neurology documentation with all the scientific facts – they’re not just out of nowhere, they’re not perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have to look at that stuff to make it real for myself because I just love gaslighting myself… It is a progressive illness. We’re catching it super early, which is amazing, but there is no cure.’  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna had noticed a growing number of troubling instances over around two years in which she couldn’t remember doing basic, everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, she returned to her car in the gym parking lot and realized she couldn’t find her keys. She checked around and underneath the car and even looked on the roof, thinking she had left them there like she'd done in the past with her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, she realized: the car was running, and the keys were in the ignition. She had already gotten in the car and turned it on but it didn't register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My car was on that whole time. I had completely blanked out the process of getting in, putting the key in, and turning the ignition on,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/i-have-early-onset-alzheimers-im-48-100001051.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIKzB4JHK31GEmdl2AXQxqYvK341rLNj2mOtC4uHs-KMPi5YsaLoJUJLgFmaDiGyC44CxjrDxvt1pOCIwvvIqh3VKza90FqXZu3YXMPToGoAksbqW_eFQHbNKu72aGah9E2MoBl6-1BlaH_cRDNjDKvzCI__Od9fgY-C7uJLa32J"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another time, she began boiling an egg on the stove, forgot about it, and left home for about half hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she eventually realized what she had done, she ran home to find her kitchen filled with smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using Framingham Heart Study data through 2009, researchers estimated that at age 45, the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s dementia was about 20 percent for women and 10 percnet for men, with slightly higher risks at age 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So, it literally almost caught my house on fire,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna's psychiatrist administered several cognitive tests, which ask people to recall words, name objects, follow simple instructions, or draw shapes. Doctors also check for memory, language, and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She failed all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months ago, when she went to a neurologist for specialized care to confirm what the tests had found, she underwent a more expansive series of tests assessing her memory, attention, language, reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each test in the neurological evaluation has its own scoring system based on what is normal for a person's age beyond just looking at whether the patient scored high or low on a test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end, the doctor reviews all of the individual test scores to spot certain patterns, such as an usually low memory score with normal attention and language skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps the doctor spot signs their patient is dealing with Alzheimer's specifically, the type of dementia whose first symptom is memory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna said: ‘Then he looked at my MRIs, looked at other things noted by the psychiatrist, and he just walked in with pamphlets of early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There was no diagnosis at that time. This was his suspicion.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing, including her medial temporal atrophy (MTA) score, which is a diagnostic tool for dementia, led to a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly 7million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s is not typical Alzheimer’s disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it’s passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to administering lengthy cognitive tests, Luna's doctor took scans of her brain to document the shrinkage that had occured until then. This is not Luna's scan, but demonstrates what brain atrophy looks like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While early-onset Alzheimer's if often hereditary, Luna did not say whether she has a family history of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people with early-onset Alzheimer's often go about 1.6 years longer before getting diagnosed than those with late-onset Alzheimer's, likely because symptoms are missed or doctors take more time to evaluate younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis, Luna's family, including her daughter and mother, is in denial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘About two months ago, I sent her [my mother] the [doctor’s] clinical notes where he's put Alzheimer's on it. And she lost it then because I think she wasn't believing it until she saw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so weird. I make fun of it all the time because that's just generally who I am. I like to keep things kind of light and funny. It's important for me to make fun of myself, to keep the morale high for the people around me, but I also need it because it is so serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could totally take this and just go on an isolation/depression bender, and I do not want to do that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna began a TikTok account where she updates her 29,000 followers about her symptoms, her daily life, and her tips for self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia will rise sharply from 6.7 million in 2023 to 12.7 million by 2050, driven largely by the aging baby boomer generation, who face a higher risk of the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has found a community on the site and many helpful tips from people in the comments section enduring similar diagnoses or helping a loved one cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the best she has heard and implemented is minimizing clutter in her home, making playlists of songs that bring her back to herself, and journaling during the day, ‘because what's one of my new things is I shower and then two hours later I feel like I need to have a shower.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘If you are a loved one [of someone with Alzheimer’s], my suggestion is to meet them where they're at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What I've found really helpful with my partner is not to be questioned but reminded, and to just believe them. And give them a hug. Tell them you love them. Because really, if I'm being completely honest, what I need is a hug from my family.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the movement in the Senate suggests an increasingly hawkish mood on Capitol Hill and a growing frustration with Russia’s intransigence among Republicans, who are ramping up their calls for decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, is leading the bipartisan push on the Russia sanctions bill, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. Last week, speaking from the Senate floor, Mr. Graham appeared to be aiming his remarks directly at the president in a bid to persuade him that any influence he may imagine he has over President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia does not appear to be having much impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Putin, in my view, is playing us all,” Mr. Graham warned. He laid out missed opportunities for diplomacy that he said proved Russia was not serious about peace. “President Trump called for a 30-day cease-fire. Ukraine said yes; Russia said no,” he said. “President Trump urged Zelensky and Putin to go to Istanbul — I was over there — and meet to have direct talks. Zelensky went; Putin didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’ve given Russia plenty of opportunity to find an honorable and just end to this war,” Mr. Graham continued. “They’re not interested. And they’re not going to change until we up the ante. So we need moral clarity here. Putin is dragging this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Trump has in recent days hinted at a change in posture. After Russia’s latest assault, he told reporters that he was “not happy” with Mr. Putin and was “considering more sanctions.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused the Russian president of “playing with fire,” saying that if it were not for Mr. Trump, “lots of really bad things would have already happened in Russia.” That prompted a bellicose response from one Russian official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII,” Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Kremlin’s security council, wrote in a social media post. “I hope Trump understands this!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;But it was not clear whether Mr. Trump’s heated rhetoric indicated any change in his broader view that it is time for the United States to wash its hands of involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has signaled a desire to move beyond the war, musing about a potential economic partnership with Russia after a peace deal. A White House adviser recently &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title=""&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that additional sanctions could hinder business opportunities, adding that the president instead wants to focus on maximizing economic opportunities with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;The White House did not reply on Tuesday to requests for an update on Mr. Trump’s stance on sanctions against Russia, and did not say whether he backed the Senate measure or was willing to send more aid or weapons to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In response to questions about Mr. Graham’s bill, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “The Russia-Ukraine war is Joe Biden’s fault, and President Trump has been clear he wants to see a negotiated peace deal. President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;So far, though, Mr. Trump’s desire to look past the current state of the war stands in stark contrast to the views of many Republicans in Congress, who maintain their party’s longstanding view of Russia as a bitter adversary that deserves to be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In a social media post on Monday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa declared that he had seen enough of Mr. Putin killing innocent civilians and publicly urged Mr. Trump to “take action,” urging him to consider “AT LEAST SANCTIONS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;On Tuesday, Mr. Grassley wrote on social media that he thought Mr. Trump had been sincere in thinking his friendship with Mr. Putin would bring an end to the war, but that “ITS TIME FOR SANCTIONS STRONG ENUF SO PUTIN KNOWS ‘game over.’” And he suggested that Mr. Trump should be at least as harsh in trying to cut off Mr. Putin from the world financial system as he has been in seeking to cut off Harvard University from federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Sanctions for Putin like no fed grants for Harvard,” he wrote in his post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Even before the latest assault, other Republicans had called for a tougher stance against Mr. Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Obviously, he’s not been serious about the negotiations,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas said last week when discussing the Russian president’s reluctance to engage in peace talks. Mr. Cornyn praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to bring both countries to the table for negotiations, but said the Russian president would first “have to get serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Both senators, like many Republicans on Capitol Hill, have tried to maintain deference to Mr. Trump’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In an opinion essay published in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday morning, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-u-s-senate-wont-tolerate-putins-games-vladimir-russia-war-ukraine-sanctions-16780c2f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Graham wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “President Trump has asked Vladimir Putin to provide a term sheet outlining the requirements for a cease-fire, bringing the roadblocks to peace to a head.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found drugs in the class, such as baricitinib, which is sold under the brand name Olumiant for the treatment of alopecia - slow down the genes that respond to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These genes play a crucial role in the body's response to viral infections,' said Aleksandr Ianevski, an NTNU researcher and co-author of the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By stopping or slowing down this pathway, JAK inhibitors remove the body's 'antiviral shield'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allows viruses to more easily gain a foothold in the body and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used advanced techniques in a lab to look at how JAK inhibitors impact organs and how viruses attack the body once they have been exposed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined cells from the lungs, eyes and brain, as well as laboratory-created mini-organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of their findings Erlend Ravlo, a PhD research fellow at NTNU, said: 'Although JAK inhibitors are effective in the treatment of inflammation, this shows that they can pose a hidden risk for patients who have latent or active viral infections.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest healthcare professionals should be cautious when prescribing JAK inhibitors, especially during viral outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common side effects of the medications include headaches, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, acne, and elevated cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, rarer but more serious side effects include severe infections like pneumonia or shingles, damage to the stomach or intestines, and changes in blood cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Sarah Erickson, who specializes in treating hair loss, sounds the alarm about JAK inhibitors in one of her TikToks where she notes some of the 'harsh' side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They are relatively new drugs, and the first JAK inhibitor, sold under the brand name Jakafi for cancer treatment, was only just approved by the FDA in 2011 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the immunosuppressive effects of the drugs could be harmful, the researchers point out that it could be useful in controlled environments, such as in the development of vaccines or screening of antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend further studies to better understand how the drugs can be used optimally, especially during virus outbreaks or pandemics,' says Ianevski. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope to increase awareness among doctors and researchers about the effects of these drugs to prevent patients from developing new illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially important for vulnerable patients, such as the elderly or individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in the medical journal, NAR Molecular Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 02:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>肠癌在年轻人中迅速上升：沉默杀手的原因和症状-印度时报 | Bowel cancer is rising rapidly in younger people: Causes and symptoms of the silent killer - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer in young people is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Scientists have found that a bacterial toxin called colibactin may be causing the rise in bowel cancer among young adults. As per them, being exposed to this toxin in childhood could increase the risk of developing cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although researchers are not certain how this exposure occurs, they know that colibactin is produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria in the gut.

It can be caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the lining of the colon or rectum, often starting as small polyps. Symptoms can include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is colibactin linked to bowel cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin has been linked to bowel cancer before, but researchers had not specifically studied its effects on people under 50 until now. This link may help explain why bowel cancer is expected to be the leading cancer-related cause of death for young adults in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that childhood infections produce colibactin, which then harms DNA in the bowel. These mutations can increase the chance of developing cancer later on, often many years after the colibactin is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin-related DNA mutations were found to be 3.3 times more common in adults diagnosed with cancer before age 40 compared to those diagnosed at 70 or older. In older patients, the DNA patterns were more often linked to normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26656679" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="causes-of-bowel-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Causes of bowel cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer is a complex disease with multiple potential causes and risk factors, including age, family history, diet, lifestyle, and certain medical conditions. While the exact cause is not always known, certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing bowel cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key risk factors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The risk of bowel cancer increases significantly with age, with most cases occurring in individuals over 50. However, younger adults of the age group 25-49 are getting more susceptible to the disease with the passing days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Family history:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A family history of bowel cancer or certain inherited conditions like Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) can increase the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A diet low in fiber and high in fat can increase the risk of bowel cancer.

Other common symptoms include rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, abdominal pain or cramping, and a feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely. Fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and weakness are also possible symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Detailed look at symptoms:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Changes in bowel habits:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This can include diarrhea, constipation, or alternating between the two.

Mr. Kennedy, who as health secretary oversees the C.D.C., has repeatedly said that children are at almost no risk from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s true that for many children, a case of Covid will be inconsequential. They might have a runny nose, a cough or other mild symptoms, if any at all, and bounce back within a few days. But some children do become seriously ill and, in rare cases, die from their infections. And data shows that over one million U.S. children have developed long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That discrepancy is at the root of a continuing debate among medical researchers about just how much of a risk Covid poses to children, and whether they should receive annual vaccines against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many agree that the original course of vaccination offered significant protection against serious illness in children. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7248a2.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Data from the C.D.C.&lt;/a&gt; shows that two or more doses of Covid vaccines were 40 percent effective at preventing emergency room visits and hospitalizations among children under the age of 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the question of whether children need annual vaccines to protect against the latest circulating variants is more contentious. Children might not benefit as much as adults would from a yearly shot because their immune systems can remember vaccinations for much longer, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has extensively studied Covid. Another argument against annual shots is that most children in the United States now have some degree of protection from previous infections or vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;COLLIN COUNTY, Texas — Collin County &lt;a href="/article/news/health/second-case-measles-reported-in-collin-county-officials-confirm/287-0c485eb1-e9e3-48b2-b829-137e03d71bdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Health Care Services &lt;/a&gt;announced that a person who was in the county from May 19 to 22 and visited multiple businesses has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a news release from the department, the person visited the following locations in Collin County: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collin County Health Care Services says they are working closely with the Texas Department of State Health Services to monitor the exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted from person-to-person through the air or contaminated surfaces," Health Care Services said. "Measles can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area. Measles can lead to serious health complications."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the listed locations during the specific dates and times should monitor themselves for measles symptoms, Health Care Services said, which include: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflamed eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Koplik’s spots: Small white spots with bluish-white centers located inside the mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, Health Care Services said you should stay home and avoid contact with others, contact your healthcare provider and call before visiting a clinic or hospital to prevent exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The star ingredient of this calming beverage—and the reason behind its golden hue—is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561449/health-benefits-of-turmeric-ginger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;. Known for its vibrant color, turmeric is a root that’s typically enjoyed in powdered form, and it’s brimming with anti-inflammatory compounds that may support gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies suggest that curcumin—the main active compound in turmeric—can help reduce inflammation of the gut lining and, as a result, may help protect against autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to turmeric, golden milk contains several other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7824258/best-anti-inflammatory-spices-for-fighting-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory spices&lt;/a&gt;, including cinnamon, ginger and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-black-pepper-11707883" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;black pepper&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to providing its own anti-inflammatory benefits, black pepper has also been shown to enhance curcumin absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

However, Hochreiter notes that this warming spice may also help keep food moving through your digestive tract, also known as gut motility. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While more research is needed, studies suggest that ginger may help promote gastric emptying, improve gut motility and minimize &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921623/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-an-upset-stomach-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;indigestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s thought that these benefits are due to active compounds found in ginger, including gingerols and shogaols, which may help stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and promote gastrointestinal contractions to keep things moving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated is key for making bathroom visits a smoother experience—literally. Drinking enough fluid can help make stool easier to pass and reduce the risk of constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While we typically think of water when it comes to hydration, milk and plant-based milk alternatives also count toward your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily fluid goal&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some people suggest that turmeric may have a gentle laxative effect and be helpful for reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including constipation. However, research is limited, with larger studies needed to confirm this effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-include-golden-milk-in-a-nightly-routine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Include Golden Milk in a Nightly Routine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a warm mug of golden milk can be a nutritious addition to your bedtime routine, helping you wind down after a long day—and if you don’t have a bedtime routine yet, it may be a good time to start. Research shows that maintaining a regular sleep-hygiene routine can improve sleep quality, which in turn can support numerous other aspects of health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hochreiter agrees: “Pairing your drink with a relaxing bedtime ritual helps to transform this nourishing drink into an act of self-care. When sipped slowly, this warm and soothing drink can help to shift your body into a parasympathetic ‘rest and digest’ state, promoting restful sleep and optimal overnight gut healing.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start by getting into comfortable, breathable clothes, putting your phone away and stepping into your kitchen. Add coconut milk (or other plant-based or cow’s milk), turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper and sweetener of choice to a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the milk into a mug and find a cozy, quiet spot in your home to sip slowly while reading or doing a guided meditation. Wrap up your routine by putting your mug in the sink, and don’t forget to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054788/oral-hygiene-improve-gut-health-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brush your teeth&lt;/a&gt;—after all, your dental hygiene can have a big impact on your gut health, too!

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-drink-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Drink for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, there’s no one “best” drink that’s helpful for everyone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why Hochreiter recommends being wary of trendy beverages that make too-good-to-be-true claims about their benefits on gut health. Instead, she recommends sticking to these general guidelines and selecting a drink that works for your needs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars, Artificial Sweeteners and Gums: &lt;/strong&gt;When possible, opt for drinks with minimal or no added sugars or artificial additives, as they may &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871982/worst-food-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;disrupt the microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and trigger symptoms, like bloating, in some folks. Instead, choose drinks that are naturally sweetened and contain easily recognizable ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Caffeine-Free Options: &lt;/strong&gt;Caffeine-free beverages, like water, milk and herbal teas, tend to be gentler on digestion and less likely to disrupt your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for Prebiotics or Probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;While they aren’t the right fit for everyone, drinks containing prebiotics or probiotics may be beneficial for some. For example, kefir is a nutritious option that provides probiotics, as well as protein and potassium. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rethinking your nightcap may be just what you need to fall asleep faster while also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting gut health&lt;/a&gt;. And when it comes to which drink to sip on before bed, Hochreiter recommends opting for a warm mug of golden milk. In addition to lending a soothing aroma, the spices in this golden-hued beverage may help protect against inflammation in the gut and support healthy digestion. Plus, it’s a flavorful way to boost your fluid intake for the day. So what are you waiting for? Make sure your spice cabinet is stocked and brew yourself a cup of golden milk for a moment of Zen before bed—it might just lead to better zzz’s too!

But like many young people, she started to use more heavily during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The youngest of four sisters, she was was "the light of our lives," her sister Kathleen Dial told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Ms Caldwell's use continued to escalate, to the point that her addiction "started running her life".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She temporarily lost use of her legs after an overdose, which also rendered her incontinent. Still, she continued to use, buying it in local smoke shops, inhaling it in the car park and then heading straight back into the shop to buy more. She sometimes spent hundreds of dollars a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She died last November, in one of those car parks just outside a vape shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"She didn't think that it would hurt her because she was buying it in the smoke shop, so she thought she was using this substance legally," Ms Dial said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The progression of Ms Caldwell's addiction – from youthful misuse to life-threatening compulsion – has become increasingly common. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers found there was a 58 % increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide in the US between 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a worst-case scenario, inhalation of nitrous oxide can lead to hypoxia, where the brain does not get enough oxygen. This can result in death. Regular inhalation can also lead to a Vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause nerve damage, degradation of the spinal column and even paralysis. The number of deaths attributed to nitrous oxide poisonings rose by more than 110% between 2019 and 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Possession of nitrous oxide was criminalised in the UK in 2023 after misuse among young people increased during the pandemic. But while many states have also outlawed the recreational use of the product in the US, it is still legal to sell as a culinary product. Only Louisiana has totally banned the retail sale of the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Galaxy Gas, a major manufacturer, even offers recipes for dishes, including Chicken Satay with Peanut Chili Foam and Watermelon Gazpacho on their website. With flavours like Blue Raspberry or Strawberries and Cream, experts warn this loophole - as well as major changes in packaging and retail - has contributed to the rise in misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Until recently users would take single-use plain metal canisters weighing around 8g and inhale the gas using a balloon. But when usage spiked during the pandemic, nitrous oxide manufacturers began selling much larger canisters online – as large as 2kg – and, eventually, in shops selling electronic vapes and other smoking paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Companies also began to package the gas in bright colourful canisters with designs featuring characters from computer games and television series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pat Aussem, of the Partnership to End Addiction, believes these developments are behind increased misuse:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even being called Galaxy Gas or Miami Magic is marketing," she said. "If you have large canisters, then it means that more people can try it and use it and that can lead to a lot of peer pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The BBC reached out for comment to both Galaxy Gas and Miami Magic but did not receive a response. Amazon, where the gas is sold online, has said they are aware of customers misusing nitrous oxide and that they are working to implement further safety measures. In a response to reporting from CBS News, the BBC's news partner in the US, Galaxy Gas maintained that the gas was intended for culinary use and that they include a message on their sites warning against misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Concern about nitrous oxide misuse increased last year, after several videos of people using the product went viral online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On social media, videos of young people getting high on gas became a trend. A video uploaded in July 2024 by an Atlanta-based fast-food restaurant featured a young man inhaling Strawberries and Cream flavoured nitrous oxide saying "My name's Lil T, man", his voice made deeper by the gas. To date the clip has been viewed about 40 million times and spawned thousands of copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Misuse also featured heavily in rap music videos and Twitch streaming. Guests tried it on the Joe Rogan Show and rappers including Ye (formerly Kanye West) spoke about abusing the substance publicly. Ye has since sued his dentist for "recklessly" supplying Ye with "dangerous amounts of nitrous oxide".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In response to the trend, TikTok blocked searches for "galaxy gas," and redirected users to a message offering resources about substance use and addiction. Rapper SZA also alerted her social media followers about its harms and slammed it for "being MASS marketed to black children".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an official alert warning against inhaling the gas after it "observed an increase in reports of adverse events after inhalation of nitrous oxide products". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The FDA told the BBC that it "continues to actively track adverse events related to nitrous oxide misuse and will take appropriate actions to protect the public health".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Flavoured nitrous oxide cans sold in a smoke shop near Washington, DC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But for some, these warnings came too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2023, the family of a 25-year-old woman, Marissa Politte successfully sued Nitrous Distributor United Brands for $745m in damages after the radiology technician was killed by a driver high on nitrous oxide. The jury found the company responsible for selling the product in the knowledge that it would be misused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Marissa Politte's death shouldn't have happened in the first place, but my God, it should be the last," Johnny Simon, the Politte family's lawyer, said at the time. In the years since there have been several fatal traffic accidents involving the gas both in the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Meanwhile, Ms Caldwell's family have launched a class action lawsuit against manufacturers and distributors of nitrous oxide, hoping to remove the product from retail sales across the US for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The people who administer nitrous oxide in a dentist office now have to go through hours and hours of training, she said. "It just is crazy to me that the drug can be purchased in a smoke shop to anyone who goes in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Unfortunately, it's become very obvious that the manufacturers and the owners of the smoke shops are not going to do the moral thing and take this off the shelves themselves," Ms Dial said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:20:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5vVXVwempXVWpkNzB0QllTZDMzajloZUJFS1BxTDNBVjd4ZXpaTE9JSGJCMW1JOFBLdUZmWnIwR0I5UzBTaWl5dzExeEZYWUNvVEJxWmVtd1VUd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1OZ1UzQTlLSnExV0ljNUctUUphbnR0OW9LTUQxVHFmTWcycnlqNVFiY1U1MUJlbFl0UExLVGhRSE9sd3JLbXJrOW9KUDdoem9VV2Q0UXZNN2R2OEVZaVlZ</guid></item><item><title>科林县警告在麦金尼的4个公共场所接触麻疹-达拉斯新闻 | Collin County warns of measles exposure at 4 public venues in McKinney - Dallas News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPX3hnNnY1QWswbF9HSk1OYlMtajVkVGhNSDdvcC1DSUdCZU5KOXZJWS01SlZHd0lFeng0d1RxOWhlNTlNTXZGS18tTmtkLXdubnpGaWV2ZTluTjNhcHBORjNNbjRIMzVFeGREV0JsY2RQU1dNSUZuWnJ5ZHFjOWFGWkFwckR5eTdTbWFRZ2I3cnJVdk1LbkdjUWdxYjUyU3VSalAyaGdHZVd0NVg1V3MyS09MSnUxMWJGZWlmZXYyMU4yOFotNWE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="body-text dmnc_features-article-body-body-module__Ldbl- mb-8 false"&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Amid an outbreak of &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/measles/" rel=""&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in Texas, Collin County officials on Tuesday warned the public of exposures at four different locations in McKinney last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In a news release, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/collin-county/" rel=""&gt;Collin County&lt;/a&gt; Health Care Services said there was a measles exposure between May 19 and May 22 at the following locations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="body-text-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;24 Hour Fitness, 1601 N.

Collin County officials said the virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The virus, however, spreads mostly amongst people who are not vaccinated against it.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that managing eight risk factors may help people with hypertension avoid early death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risk factors include cholesterol, blood sugar, smoking status and physical activity, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each factor improved, the researchers observed a lower risk of early death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hypertension is a major health issue that increases the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and early death. Studies show that more than 30% of adults around the world are affected by hypertension, making it a top cause of preventable deaths globally.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; People with high blood pressure are at a greater risk of developing certain other concerning health conditions, but research has found that managing multiple health factors together can greatly lower these risks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By controlling these factors, individuals with high blood pressure may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce their chances of heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and even eliminate some of the extra risks associated with the condition. For a recent study&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;researchers wanted to further understand how managing multiple risk factors together could lower the chance of dying early for people with high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result, the researchers determined eight health factors that could help people with high blood pressure lower their risk of early death. The results were published in &lt;em&gt;Precision Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt;—let’s unpack what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers evaluated data from the UK Biobank study, a large research project that collected health data from more than 500,000 adults aged 40 to 69. Participants provided information about their health and lifestyle through touchscreen questionnaires or interviews at 27 centers across the United Kingdom. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this specific analysis, researchers focused on people with high blood pressure (hypertension), which resulted in 70,898 individuals being included in the study. These participants were then carefully matched with 224,069 people without hypertension based on their age, gender and the center they visited for the study. This matching process ensured the groups were similar, making it easier to compare and understand the effects of hypertension accurately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at eight key health factors to see how well they were being managed. These factors included: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blood pressure &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body mass index (BMI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waist size&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking habits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical activity &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants could have any number of factors under control, from zero to eight. The main focus of the study was to understand early deaths and what might contribute to them. The researchers looked at deaths from all causes, cancer, heart and blood vessel diseases (known as cardiovascular disease) and other causes that happened before the age of 80. To define “early death,” they followed previous research that uses 80 years as the cutoff age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over a follow-up period of almost 14 years, researchers studied over 70,000 individuals with high blood pressure and recorded 6,466 early deaths. These included deaths from cancer, heart disease and other causes. They found that people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/a-healthy-lifestyle-may-offset-genetic-risk-factors-8642546" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better control over key health risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;managing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding smoking, had a significantly lower chance of dying early. Specifically, the risk of dying early from cancer went down by 12%, from heart disease by 21% and from other causes by 10%. People who managed seven or more risk factors effectively showed the most significant protection, lowering their risk of premature death by 40% for all causes, 39% for cancer, 53% for CVD and 29% for other causes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers found that as more health risk factors were well-managed, people with high blood pressure experienced an even lower chance of dying early from all causes, including cancer and heart disease, compared to those without high blood pressure. For those with high blood pressure who kept four or more risk factors under control, their risk of early death was similar to those without high blood pressure. Overall, better control of risk factors led to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-may-reduce-premature-death-risk-by-23-percent-8656685" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significant reductions in early death rates&lt;/a&gt;, with improvements ranging from 30% to over 100% for different causes of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to recognize a few limitations of this study. First, the researchers didn’t take into account any changes in risk factors that might have happened during the follow-up period. Second, even though they adjusted for many different factors, there’s still a chance that some unmeasured factors could have influenced results. Third, most of the participants were white Europeans, so more research is needed to see if the findings apply to people across other groups and identities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, because this study was observational, it’s hard to draw definitive conclusions about cause and effect. While the study points to potential associations, further experimental research is necessary to establish whether these relationships are truly causal or simply coincidental. Finally, the researchers weren’t able to include lifestyle factors in their analysis because of limited data and incomplete reporting by the participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-this-applies-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How This Applies to Real Life &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings of this research highlight how proactively managing multiple health factors may help reduce the risks associated with high blood pressure. If you are living with hypertension, this means that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintaining healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;controlling blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/total-exercise-matters-more-than-number-of-days-8725667" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding smoking and maintaining a healthy body weight may drastically improve overall health outcomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study suggests that even small improvements across key health areas may collectively lower the risk of early death, offering a clear and actionable strategy for individuals aiming to manage their hypertension more effectively. Steps people with high blood pressure should consider taking, based on this study, include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor your blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;Regularly check your blood pressure to ensure it stays within a healthy range, typically below 120/80 mmHg. Consider reducing sodium intake and managing stress levels to help keep it under control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a healthy body weight. &lt;/strong&gt;Though &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;BMI is not a helpful metric&lt;/a&gt; for everyone, these researchers suggest trying to stay within a healthy weight range, which a health care provider can help you determine. Sticking with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-fiber-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-11733961" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;a healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt; can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to keep a healthy waist circumference. &lt;/strong&gt;Some research suggests using waist circumference—not BMI—as a way to gauge how much visceral fat you might be carrying. These researchers recommend a circumference of about 88 centimeters or less for women and 102 centimeters or less for men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat plenty of heart-healthy foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Those foods—like oats, nuts and fatty fish—can help you&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;manage your cholesterol levels. We’d recommend you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-cholesterol-8691621" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;avoid excess saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, too. And if you’re really concerned about your cholesterol, get support from a health care provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep an eye on your blood sugar. &lt;/strong&gt;Foods like complex carbohydrates, proteins and healthy fats can help keep your blood sugar at a healthy, stable level. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-when-you-wake-up-for-better-blood-sugar-8761186" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Exercise and hydration&lt;/a&gt; can help, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay on top of your kidney health. &lt;/strong&gt;Drink plenty of water daily, limit high-sodium foods and monitor your intake of over-the-counter medications, as excessive use may strain the kidneys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking. &lt;/strong&gt;If you smoke, seek support to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay physically active. &lt;/strong&gt;Incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly. To enhance muscle mass and overall fitness, try for a mix of strength training and cardio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in &lt;em&gt;Precision Clinical Medicine &lt;/em&gt;underscores the effect that managing multiple health risk factors may have on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing the risks associated with hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. By addressing areas such as blood pressure, weight, cholesterol and lifestyle habits, people with high blood pressure may significantly lower their risk of early death from various causes, including heart disease and cancer. Small, sustained improvements across these key factors can contribute to meaningful positive outcomes.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A judge ultimately let Jirah reunite with her parents in late March, but Alandria continues to face criminal charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, prosecutors pursued an indictment against the mother, and a grand jury indictment claimed Alandria caused her daughter's injury by 'aggressively grabbing, twisting or pulling the arm of an infant child.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A heavily-redacted arrest warrant obtained by CBS News also described the incident as involving 'grabbing and pulling with force sufficient to cause the fracture.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alandria is now due to make her first court appearance next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, a spokesperson for Children's Health told the outlet that its 'top priority is the health and wellbeing of all our patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to patient privacy concerns, we do not discuss the status of individual patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Child Protective Services also declined to comment, citing confidentiality, but noted that it is complying with all court orders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 22:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNSmtxdmswR3lTSlMzeklodjk3SlZib0Z0alVHM0pBN3VPMG9CdzZ4WFgwTmRWY1JrQVRKOHVkRkd0WmNrVVE5N2laeGx2bnJYbktJVU5TNzVUdFB0M1FJSnRvVGNHSGNHcGhUbXFCcm1NeGNsTjJPRjE1TXEyU0dDZ2s3bUV3VnRNR2ZyVVB1Sk83cmF0MkY0WURVb19EMGpYeHhmUEYyelh1ZGVUdEZHQtIBtgFBVV95cUxPZW45MDE1U0kwSVk0bkFyVlBWa2Z6WjJFbXdUMDUtWWwwYWpMMmlZMG9BUldjZG9JZ3VxbG1lSm51Z2lqZVZreWVaSFV2MUF0NWlJazZvbHZNWFpOelhuSU1zcXV4aDQ1VWxSdjZNTFBIcDNqbDhSSEI0Y1RfNDlNTFFPamRiTTB1ZW5CMzhGNkVpc3VFV0RleUd0Y285alljLXgzMzhjRGtVNlRTb0JwOGxnaklQZw</guid></item><item><title>蜱虫给你的ick ？如果您、您的孩子或宠物被咬，您应该和不应该做什么—雅虎 | Ticks giving you the ick?

Tell them about the recent tick bite, when it occurred and the place it likely occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While a bull’s eye rash is a telltale sign of Lyme disease, it’s not the most common way a Lyme disease rash will present itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Fever, aches, and abrupt and severe fatigue can be the main symptoms of acute Lyme,” according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.hopkinslyme.org/lyme-education/lyme-disease-prevention-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins research center;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Johns Hopkins research center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-antibiotics-necessary-after-a-tick-bite"&gt;Are antibiotics necessary after a tick bite?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, the CDC doesn’t recommend taking antibiotics after a tick bite in order to prevent tick-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“However, in certain circumstances, a single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite in an area where Lyme disease is common may lower risk of Lyme disease,” the CDC website says. It advises that people talk to their health care provider about whether antibiotics are right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-found-a-tick-crawling-on-me-but-it-hasnt-attached-to-my-skin-can-i-get-sick"&gt;I found a tick crawling on me, but it hasn’t attached to my skin. Will I get sick?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. A tick has to bite the skin and feed on a person’s or pet’s blood in order to spread any possible diseases. If you have found one crawling on you, another person or a pet, do a tick check for any other ones that may have attached. If found, remove promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-long-does-it-take-for-an-attached-tick-to-spread-disease"&gt;How long does it take for an attached tick to spread disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It depends on the type of tick and the disease.

You may have been bitten by a different tick that was infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bottom line is that if you have been infected, you will likely develop symptoms before the test results are ready.

At the same time, the percentage of mothers who said their mental health was poor increased — particularly among those who were single parents, or whose children had Medicaid or were uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings come at a fraught moment in the national conversation around parenting and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/health/birth-rates-cdc.html" title=""&gt;declining birthrates&lt;/a&gt;. The Trump administration is said to be &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html" title=""&gt;weighing strategies&lt;/a&gt; to persuade more Americans to get married and have children. But just last year, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, who was then the surgeon general, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/upshot/parents-stress-murthy-warning.html" title=""&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; about declining parental mental health in an advisory that described many who were raising children as “exhausted, burned out and perpetually behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The surgeon general’s report led the researchers behind the new study to begin analyzing data from nearly 200,000 mothers who participated in the National Survey of Children’s Health — an annual survey of households with children up to age 17. Researchers found that one in 20 mothers reported her mental health was poor or fair in 2016; by 2023 the ratio was about one in 12. In contrast, one in 22 fathers surveyed reported fair or poor mental health in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are limitations to the study, which was cross-sectional — meaning it looked at snapshots in time but did not follow the same women year over year. It also relied on self-reporting. Still, the findings are not surprising to experts in the field of maternal mental health, who have been observing the decline in emotional well-being for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Tamar Gur, endowed director of the Soter Women’s Health Research Program at Ohio State University, said that if nothing else, the new findings would help reassure the mothers she treats that they are not the only ones struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating snacks with potassium, protein and fiber like our Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast can support healthy weight loss and blood pressure management. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple dietary adjustments, such as following the DASH diet and cooking at home, can significantly reduce sodium intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm#:~:text=Nearly%20half%20of%20adults%20in,are%20taking%20medication%20for%20hypertension." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, nearly half of adults have high blood pressure (that’s over 119.9 million people).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While there are many conditions that can influence someone having high blood pressure, data does suggest that adults who have a greater body fat percentage (adiposity) account for 65% to 78% of those diagnosed with primary hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having high blood pressure also puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in America today.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Given these statistics, it's important to be proactive with small, simple changes that may have a big impact on your blood pressure. And one simple way of doing this is by including snacks that support both healthy blood pressure and weight management. And according to a dietitian, the #1 snack for weight loss when you have high blood pressure is this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261628/peanut-butter-banana-cinnamon-toast/#recipe-body" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast&lt;/a&gt;. The nutrients in this dynamic combo not only pair perfectly together, but also offer a big nutritional bang for your bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-its-so-great"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why It's So Great  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I'm not kidding when I say that as a registered dietitian nutritionist and busy mom of two, I eat this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261628/peanut-butter-banana-cinnamon-toast/#recipe-body" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast&lt;/a&gt; daily not only for its convenience, but also for its powerful benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don't believe me? Then take it from &lt;a href="http://www.olivetreenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rahaf Al Bochi, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. She shares, "A combination of banana, peanut butter and whole-grain toast is a great snack because it provides protein, fiber-rich carbs and healthy fats, which helps keep your blood sugars stable, gives you energy and keeps you full."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to mention, this simple snack is a great source of several nutrients, and these are a few worth noting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s a Good Source of Potassium  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you've heard of potassium, you've likely heard bananas mentioned in the same sentence. That's because bananas are one of the best-known sources of potassium, an important electrolyte essential for keeping your body's fluid levels in balance. Potassium is a dynamic duo with sodium. Potassium works intracellularly to manage fluids, while sodium works extracellularly to help manage your blood pressure as well as keeping your heart pumping smoothly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A medium banana provides around 9% of the Daily Value of potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's not the highest food source of potassium (&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;apricots and potatoes actually pack more per serving&lt;/a&gt;), it's an easy, convenient and budget-friendly choice most people can find at their local grocer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Delicious and nutritious, a 2-tablespoon serving of peanut butter provides around 7 grams of protein, 12 grams of unsaturated fat and 2 grams of filling fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This trio of nutrients found in peanuts (and other nuts) has been shown to potentially help support weight-loss efforts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, this combination has the satiation factor, meaning you're left feeling full and satisfied after eating, and are less likely to mindlessly munch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Be mindful of the type of peanut butter you're choosing. While natural peanut butter is very low in added sugar and sodium, we know there are a variety of options on the market these days that do not have the same nutrition profile. Al Bochi recommends choosing a peanut butter that is "natural" and doesn't contain any added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Includes Whole Grains  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There's a reason why the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends making at least half your grains whole: they're packed with good nutrition!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unlike their enriched or refined counterparts, whole grains contain the bran, germ and endosperm of wheat. This composition of whole grains—including whole-grain breads—provides fiber, which may benefit weight loss and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A study found that replacing refined grains with whole grains led to a decline in body fat percentage and improvements in cholesterol and blood sugar levels, thus decreasing risk for cardiometabolic diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But, buyer beware: you need to be cognizant of the type of bread you're purchasing, because they aren't all created equally. Al Bochi shares, "Sometimes there can be hidden [added] sugars and salt in bread products, so choose products that contain 5% or less of Daily Value for sodium and sugar." Also, try to choose breads that offer at least 2 grams of dietary fiber and 4 or more grams of protein per slice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Al Bochi recommends that people with high blood pressure consider the&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2054270/how-to-follow-the-dash-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; DASH Diet&lt;/a&gt;: "The DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, has been shown to be effective in managing blood pressure. This eating pattern focuses on including plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy, beans, nuts, poultry and fish, while limiting sodium intake to under 2,300 milligrams per day."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of thinking about what you can't eat, focus on what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and try to add more of those foods to your daily meals and snacks. The nutrient combination in this snack can certainly fit into this eating pattern, especially when you choose a lower-sodium bread and peanut butter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cook at Home  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let's face it, we know you're busy and the convenience of picking up takeout or having a prepackaged meal can be lifesaving. However, it's important to be mindful of how frequently you're doing this, because fast foods and frozen meals often pack more sodium than you need (or want) in one meal. Al Bochi recommends cooking more foods at home to help cut back on your sodium intake. But, this doesn't have to mean you're cooking 21 meals at home every week!
&lt;/p&gt;

A scrambled egg omelet with roasted veggies can pair perfectly with the Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast for a simple meal that comes together in no time flat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Losing weight while managing high blood pressure does not mean you have to live on a plain or lackluster diet. Embrace an additive mindset, focusing on the simple, easy-to-prepare meals and snacks you can enjoy, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261628/peanut-butter-banana-cinnamon-toast/#recipe-body" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior COVID-19 vaccination did not stop the immune system from mounting a protective response to the delta and omicron strains, though new mutation-specific antibody production dipped slightly, according to a study led by researchers at the University of Arizona Health Sciences and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-025-02162-2" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Immunology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The paper, titled "Intrinsic immunogenicity is a major determinant of type-specific responses in post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections," could inform future &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; development efforts and help set vaccination and booster strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we really wanted to address is this fundamental question of how the immune system adapts when you're exposed to a virus and then the virus changes—are you able to generate new responses against those new mutations?" said Deepta Bhattacharya, Ph.D., inaugural executive director of the U of A Health Sciences Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies and professor of immunobiology at the U of A College of Medicine–Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that even though new responses to the mutated parts of the virus are down a bit in vaccinated people who get infected, the overall protective response is much, much higher than in those who were unvaccinated when infected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team examined &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibody+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibody responses&lt;/a&gt; to delta and omicron infections in people who were either unvaccinated or vaccinated against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. They found that overall antibody production for the delta and omicron variants was greater in people who received the original COVID-19 vaccine than in those who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of delta-specific antibodies, though, was partially suppressed in people who were previously vaccinated compared with those who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"If you got vaccinated against the original virus strain, and then you got a delta virus infection, you made a ton of protective antibody responses overall, but slightly fewer against the parts of the virus that had mutated compared with people who hadn't had that vaccine," Bhattacharya said, noting that in each variant there are pieces of the virus that did not change. The antibodies aimed at those parts, he said, are extremely protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that immune changes due to antigenic imprinting—the suppression of the original immune response when faced with a slightly different version of the virus—may be too small to be of functional consequence for SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What was really interesting is that even people whose very first exposure was to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/delta/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt; or to omicron, so there was no prior immunity at all, were making very poor responses against the mutant parts of the virus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya, who is also a member of the university's BIO5 Institute, said one of the key takeaways from the study is the potential to develop vaccines in different ways to elicit strong immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If researchers can determine which parts of the virus are causing evasion of the immune system, they could engineer vaccines to make sure that the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; is effectively seeing the entire &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/virus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;. That, he says, is an important part of broadening the immune response to include inevitable viral mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Bhattacharya would like to take a closer look at what is causing the suppression of new antibody responses by prior immunity. That information, he says, could be used to develop logical frameworks for when vaccinations and boosters should be administered.&lt;/p&gt;

The strain was first detected in international travelers arriving at US airports between late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the variant has been found through airport surveillance testing at major entry points including California, Washington State, Virginia, and New York City. Separate reports have confirmed additional cases in Ohio, Rhode Island, and Hawaii, according to the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the total cases remains low in the US and too sparse for CDC to track comprehensively, scientists warn that the variant may be significantly more transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation" class="checktheseout2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;p&gt;“It appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily,” said Dr. Subhash Verma, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada told CBS news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NB.1.8.1 variant has already become the dominant strain in China, leading to spikes in emergency room visits and hospital admissions across the country. In Hong Kong, authorities have reported the worst Covid surge in at least a year, noting 81 severe cases and 30 deaths within a four-week period, mostly among seniors over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What they’re seeing in China, Hong Kong and some other areas where this variant has really surged, is an increase in hospitalization,” Dr. Amy Edwards of Case Western Reserve University’s medical school told CBS news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s airport screening program found that travelers carrying the NB.1.8.1 strain had recently passed through countries such as Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, Vietnam, Spain, and the Netherlands, suggesting a broad global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the spike in cases abroad, experts say there is no current evidence that NB.1.8.1 is more deadly than previous strains. However, there are concerns it may be better at evading vaccine protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the US has stopped recommending routine Covid-19 vaccinations for healthy children and pregnant women. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, announced that the shots have been removed from the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed Covid-19 shots from the CDC and Prevention's recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the US Department of Health and Human Services.'&lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doctors and public health leaders called the move concerning and confusing. “There's no new data or information, just them flying by the seat of their pants,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1.2 million people have died in the US from Covid-19, most of them elderly. But children haven't been spared: The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-space-shield-is-nuclear-war-scenario-north-korea-glbs-2731043-2025-05-27" target="_self"&gt;US space shield is 'nuclear war scenario': North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dottedimg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="authors__container"&gt;&lt;div class="authors__by"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published By: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;Rivanshi Rakhrai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="published__on"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published On: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;May 28, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Wells said.

"We had a lot of cases in one community. But with that, they've also built up natural immunity to measles, so that just adds more kind of speed bumps and slows down the virus from spreading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health in the Yale School of Public Health, explained that measles is incredibly contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Just one infected patient can spread measles to up to nine out of 10 susceptible close contacts, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=Up%20to%209%20out%20of,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Ultimately that reservoir of unvaccinated individuals -- who are either too young to be vaccinated or can't be vaccinated or had family members who chose not to vaccinate them -- ultimately that gets exhausted," he told ABC News. "So, I think that's the story here and the idea that the outbreak, to some degree, kind of burned itself out in terms of its acceptable population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schwartz did add that the U.S. is still seeing flare-ups of isolated measles cases and small outbreaks in various part of the U.S. not associated with large outbreaks seen in Texas or New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;On Tuesday, Nebraska health officials &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/First-Confirmed-Measles-Case-Reported-in-Nebraska.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a measles case in a "vaccinated child with no out-of-state travel history," making Nebraska the 32nd state to report a case of measles this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Changing behavior&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Anecdotally, Wells said she believed some people in Lubbock and the surrounding community changed their behavior in response to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With public awareness campaigns, people began staying home when they knew they were infected, which has limited exposures in places like doctors' offices and day cares, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A sign is seen outside a clinic with the South Plains Public Health District, on Feb. 23, 2025, in Brownfield, Texas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Julio Cortez/AP, FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're not seeing as many people going into the doctor's office ... and we're not seeing seeing hospitalizations like we were seeing before … which is a very good sign," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Halkitis said this change of behavior is similar to the mpox outbreak in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My comparison to that is mpox, where we saw a huge change in behaviors in gay men and a large uptake in vaccination," he said. "I haven't seen a similar push [with measles]. We're talking about, remember, a small segment of the population that's unvaccinated.

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138"&gt;58-second video&lt;/a&gt; posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other details were released, and HHS officials did not immediately respond to questions about how the decision was made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some doctors and public health leaders called the move concerning and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no new data or information, just them flying by the seat of their pants,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of changing the recommendations is not completely out of the blue. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older — who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-cdc-acip-kennedy-d9777cba947f5f52705af04d95e5f7fa"&gt;CDC advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;decided not to wait&lt;/a&gt; for the scientific panel’s review. He said that annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids “despite the lack of any clinical data” to support that decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some physicians and public health leaders expressed concern that HHS officials disregarded a scientific review process that has been in place for decades, in which experts — in public meetings — review current medical evidence and hash out the pros and cons of policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dangerous precedent. If you can start doing that with this vaccine, you can start doing that with any vaccine you want — including mumps-measles-rubella,” said Osterholm, referring to another vaccine that Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-messaging-criticism-vaccine-1a2cbdc14eb0c256695fdfac00cbfb6d"&gt;voiced doubts&lt;/a&gt; about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and others said the announcement raises an array of questions, including whether health insurance companies will keep covering COVID-19 vaccinations and how hard it will be now for people who want the shots to get them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The reason we give vaccines to healthy people is to keep them safe,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1.2 million people have died in the U.S. from COVID-19, most of them elderly. But children haven’t been spared: The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, head of the National Institutes of Health, appeared in the video with Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, during the nomination process, Kennedy gave &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;assurances&lt;/a&gt; to wavering Republicans that he would not alter the federal vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since then, Kennedy and other Trump administration appointees &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;have made big changes&lt;/a&gt; to the system for approval and use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They added restrictions to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/novavax-covid19-vaccine-fda-a477c1aa612ceb293e70d904b46611b0"&gt;a recent vaccine approval&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, the FDA announced &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals&lt;/a&gt; will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the confusion created by Tuesday’s announcement, experts said, was the implication that the coronavirus isn’t dangerous to pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the pandemic, deaths of women during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-deaths-cdc-maternal-mortality-fbb4950245b517b4f4d57517b62556d9"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; to their highest level in 50 years. Indeed, pregnancy was on the list of health conditions that would qualify someone for a COVID-19 vaccination under FDA’s new guidance “framework” announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women, in part, because it’s a way to pass immunity to newborns who are too young for vaccines and are vulnerable to infections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To say that they are not at any risk is simply incorrect,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: “The science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, we've been told that sugar is a major culprit behind the global rise in type 2 diabetes. Now, emerging evidence from BYU researchers adds nuance to that message, suggesting that not all sugar sources carry the same risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study is &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2161831325000493" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis of its kind, BYU researchers—in collaboration with researchers from Germany-based institutions—found that the type and source of sugar may matter far more than previously thought. Researchers analyzed data from over half a million people across multiple continents, revealing a surprising twist: Sugar consumed through beverages—like soda and even &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fruit+juice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fruit juice&lt;/a&gt;—was consistently linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Meanwhile, other sugar sources showed no such link, and in some cases, were even associated with a lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to draw clear dose-response relationships between different sugar sources and type 2 diabetes risk," said Karen Della Corte, lead author and BYU nutritional science professor. "It highlights why drinking your sugar—whether from soda or juice—is more problematic for health than eating it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After correcting for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+mass+index/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt;, excess energy intake and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found the following dose-response relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With each additional 12-oz serving of sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e., &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/soft+drinks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;soft drinks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+drinks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy drinks&lt;/a&gt; and sports drinks) per day, the risk of developing T2D increased by 25%. This strong relationship showed that the increased risk began from the very first daily serving with no minimum threshold below which intake appeared to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With each additional 8-oz serving of fruit juice per day (i.e., 100% fruit juice, nectars and juice drinks), the risk of developing T2D increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above risks are relative not absolute. For example, if the average person's baseline risk of developing T2D is about 10%, four sodas a day could raise that to roughly 20%, not 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparatively, 20 g/day intakes of total sucrose (table sugar) and total sugar (the sum of all naturally occurring and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/added+sugars/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in the diet) showed an inverse association with T2D, hinting at a surprising protective association.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Why drinking sugar would be more problematic than eating sugar may come down to the differing metabolic effects. Sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice supply isolated sugars, leading to a greater glycemic impact that would overwhelm and disrupt liver metabolism, thereby increasing liver fat and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, dietary sugars consumed in or added to nutrient-dense foods, such as whole fruits, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dairy+products/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt;, or whole grains, do not cause metabolic overload in the liver. These embedded sugars elicit slower blood glucose responses due to accompanying fiber, fats, proteins and other beneficial nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit juice, even with some vitamins and nutrients, is much less beneficial. Because of its high and concentrated sugar content, the researchers conclude that fruit juice is a poor substitute for whole fruits, which provide more fiber to support better blood glucose regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study underscores the need for even more stringent recommendations for liquid sugars such as those in sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, as they appear to harmfully associate with metabolic health," Della Corte said. "Rather than condemning all added sugars, future dietary guidelines might consider the differential effects of sugar based on its source and form."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A modeling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7418a3.htm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of vaccination in the 19 low- and middle-income countries that have not introduced rubella-containing vaccines (RCVs) estimates that rolling out these vaccines could prevent 986,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the next 30 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of 2023, 175 of the 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member countries (90%) had included an RCV in their routine immunization programs. In 2024, the WHO recommended universal RCV for the remaining 19 countries, which saw an estimated 28,000 CRS cases—78% of all cases worldwide—in 2023 alone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study analyzed data from country reports to the WHO and UNICEF from 2019 to 2023, as well as national vaccine coverage estimates and World Bank economic information. The disease is also called "German measles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Rubella virus infection usually produces a mild febrile rash illness in children and adults," the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led research team wrote. "However, infection during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings were published last week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speeding progress toward rubella elimination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 19 countries, an estimated 1.03 million CRS cases are predicted to occur from 2025 to 2055 without RCVs. But with RCV catch-up and follow-up supplemental immunization activities—even if population coverage with measles-containing vaccines were under 80%—fewer than 60,000 cases could occur, averting more than 986,000 CRS infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) can provide lifelong protection against rubella.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Caring for CRS cases is costly, and rubella vaccination has been shown to be cost-effective in high- and middle-income countries," the authors wrote. "However, no similar studies have been conducted in low-income countries in Africa or Asia."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) can provide lifelong protection against rubella," they added. "RCV introduction in these 19 countries during 2025–2030 could rapidly accelerate progress toward rubella and CRS elimination worldwide."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They called for global partners such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to support the procurement of vaccines and the construction of the infrastructure needed to deliver them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas this year has been the center of the nation’s largest measles outbreak in more than two decades, as a mostly eradicated disease has sickened more than 700 in the state, sent dozens to hospitals and led to the death of two children who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even as the outbreak slows, a bill approved by state lawmakers and sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott would make it significantly easier for parents to enroll their children in school without standard vaccinations for diseases such as measles, whooping cough, polio and hepatitis A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters say the bill streamlines an already legal exemption process that allows families to avoid vaccines for reasons of conscience, religious beliefs or medical reasons. It would let them download the required forms from a website instead of contacting state health officials and waiting for one to come in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill does not change which vaccines are required. However, critics say easing the exemption process opens a door to further outbreaks with potentially deadly results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this bill becomes law, Texas is likely to see more illness, more death and higher health care costs for families and business,” Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer for Texas-based nonprofit Immunization Project, told state senators before the bill won final approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The outbreak (in Texas) is not a coincidence. It is the canary in the coal mine screaming at the top of its lungs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exemption bill — as well as other bills passed by the Texas House on lawsuits against vaccine makers and removing immunization restrictions on organ transplants — are a snapshot of efforts across dozens of conservative states to question vaccines or roll back requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the national level, this wave has been buoyed by still-lingering pushback from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Trump administration’s embrace of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was one of the nation’s leading anti-vaccine advocates before being appointed secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent federal data shows U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates have dipped since the pandemic — 92.7% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 95% before COVID-19 — and the proportion of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high. And last week, the “Make America Healthy Again” federal report on the nation’s health and wellness questioned the necessity of vaccine mandates for schoolkids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/diseases-know-no-borders-measles-spreads-with-outbreaks-in-canada-mexico-and-u-s"&gt;‘Diseases know no borders’: Measles spreads with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national Association of Immunization Managers, an organization of state and local immunization officials, has been tracking nearly 600 vaccine-related bills across the country in 2025, and the majority would not be considered pro-vaccine, said Brent Ewig, the group’s the group’s chief policy officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We saw a spike in vaccine-related bills during the pandemic. The last few years it had been tapering off. With recent actions at the federal level, there has been a spike again,” Ewig said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Texas measles outbreak and vaccine requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has been considered eliminated from the United States since 2000. The Texas outbreak started in late January in West Texas’ Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, and the highly contagious virus quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many states, Texas requires children to obtain vaccines to protect against 11 diseases to attend public and private schools and child care centers. The state’s vaccination rates for the 2023-24 school year ranged between 93.78% for chicken pox to 95.78% for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But parents can obtain exemptions for religious or personal reasons, or if a doctor determines it would not be safe because of a medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption rates in Texas have been rising for nearly two decades, with a dramatic spike over the last five years. According to the Texas Department of Health Services, the agency received exemption requests for nearly 153,000 students in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, up from 136,000 the previous year and nearly double the 77,000 requested in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Texas’ vaccine rollback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill on vaccine exemption paperwork would make it easier for parents to obtain the needed form by letting them download it to a computer or smartphone. The current system where parents ask state health officials to mail a paper copy to their home can sometimes take weeks. The form would still need to be notarized before it is turned in to a school and a student is enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates say the changes would help parents thread the bureaucratic process and get their children enrolled in school quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This bill is not about whether vaccines are good or bad, it’s about government efficiency and keeping kids in schools,” said Jackie Schlegal, founder of Texans for Medical Freedom, which advocates for “vaccine freedom of choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that simplifying the exemption form process makes it too easy for unvaccinated kids to enroll in a school, endangering the health of other kids and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For years Texas has struck a delicate balance of parents’ right and public health and safety,” Lakshmanan said. “This bill is more than just a form … We can support parents without putting other families at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still waiting for a Senate vote is a bill that would allow vaccine makers who advertise in Texas to be sued if their vaccine causes a person to be injured. That bill has been opposed by the Texas Association of Manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of that bill is first-term state Rep. Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed in 2020 for opening her Dallas salon in violation of governor’s emergency order during the pandemic. Abbott quickly weakened his enforcement of coronavirus safeguards and a court ordered her released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most women do not consume the RDA for vitamin D. Still, they can meet their vitamin D needs through sun exposure and a combination of foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Sunlight Exposure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exposure to sunlight is essential for the body to produce vitamin D. About 80% of vitamin D in the body comes from the sun.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Balancing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-spf-1068889" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ultraviolet (UV)&lt;/a&gt; exposure with the need for vitamin D is tricky. However, research shows that protecting skin from UV rays with sunscreen does not meaningfully impact vitamin D levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A person's vitamin D levels dip in seasons with less light, like winter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Individuals who spend significant amounts of time indoors may require more vitamin D from other sources—people who always cover their bodies when outside are at a greater risk of a vitamin D deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Age and Life Stage &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is necessary for infants. Although breast milk contains some vitamin D, it is not enough to meet the RDA of 10 mcg. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/food-to-eat-while-breastfeeding-5195736" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Breastfed infants&lt;/a&gt; should receive supplemental vitamin D. However, formulas contain sufficient vitamin D, so supplementation is unnecessary.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Older adults have higher vitamin D requirements. The body’s ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight decreases with age. Additionally, older adults may be more likely to spend more time indoors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Skin Tone &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/melanin-8665833" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melanin is a pigment&lt;/a&gt; that gives skin its color. It also filters UV light and protects skin against sun damage. Higher melanin levels cause darker skin pigmentation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People with skin that has more melanin typically need more sunlight to get &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-vitamin-d-supplement-make-skin-darker-11680093" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;enough vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. This can be more challenging during winter months or in lower light. Conversely, skin with less melanin gets vitamin D from the sun more easily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Geographic Location &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D production increases at higher altitudes because of greater UV exposure. Conversely, smog, cloud cover, and thicker ozone layers limit the amount of UV radiation that reaches the skin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Locations further from the equator at higher altitudes experience less sunlight in the winter and more in the summer. This contributes to seasonal differences in vitamin D status.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastric procedures&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Procedures, like &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/gastric-bypass-surgery-recovery-5087733" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gastric bypass&lt;/a&gt;, affect the upper small intestine, where vitamin D is absorbed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastrointestinal conditions&lt;/strong&gt;: Certain conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ulcerative-colitis-7111961" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;, impact fat absorption, which increases the risk of deficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with obesity&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D is stored in fat (adipose) tissue. People affected by obesity tend to have lower levels of circulating vitamin D.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with alcohol use disorder&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Regular, excessive alcohol use (for women, eight or more drinks per week or four or more on any day) may reduce vitamin D levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobacco use&lt;/strong&gt;: Tobacco use can lower vitamin D levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research on the importance of vitamin D continues to evolve, with more evidence supporting its essential role in female health. Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels has benefits, including:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bone health&lt;/strong&gt;: Women reach peak bone mass around 30. Vitamin D is essential for supporting bone mass accumulation. Significant bone remodeling occurs post-menopause, requiring adequate vitamin D levels to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/osteoporosis-4012671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research found supplementing with vitamin D and calcium reduces the risk of total and hip fractures by 15% and 30%, respectively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune function&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D plays a key role in immune health by helping regulate inflammation, supporting the body’s defense against pathogens, and reducing overactive immune responses linked to autoimmune diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may also support a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/gut-microbiome-7253375" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. Low levels are tied to higher risks of infections and autoimmune conditions like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hashimotos-disease-7485191" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Hashimoto’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood regulation&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D plays a role in brain health by interacting with neurons and influencing mood-related neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Low vitamin D levels are linked to depression, including during pregnancy and postpartum. However, research on whether supplements improve symptoms is mixed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research is needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;: About 40% of pregnant individuals are vitamin D deficient, which is associated with pregnancy complications. Ensuring adequate vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy may improve pregnancy outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Low vitamin D levels are linked to a higher risk of miscarriage, preeclampsia, and low birth weight, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adequate vitamin D may also improve &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ivf-5119348" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;in vitro fertilization&lt;/a&gt; (IVF) success and reduce the risk of severe postpartum bleeding, but further studies are required.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-test-4691741" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D blood test&lt;/a&gt; measures 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), the circulating form of vitamin D. Calcidiol reflects vitamin D from sun exposure, supplements, and food.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood tests enable you to check your vitamin D status and adjust your routine accordingly, whether that includes adding or changing a supplement dosage.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are three ways to get vitamin D, which include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunlight&lt;/strong&gt;: Sunlight is the best natural source of vitamin D, with peak production occurring between 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. However, this is also when the risk of sun damage is highest.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/spf-sun-protection-factor-and-sunscreen-2634104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sunscreen (SPF up to 30)&lt;/a&gt; minimizes vitamin D production, so you can protect your skin while supporting healthy levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Natural food sources of vitamin D include rainbow trout,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Atlantic salmon,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; raw, white mushrooms (exposed to ultraviolet light),&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and eggs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many food products have vitamin D added. Fortified food sources of vitamin D include 2% milk and soy milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D comes in two forms: D2 (plant-based) and D3 (often animal-based but also derived from lichen). The body absorbs them both well. Research suggests D3 may raise vitamin D levels more effectively, but both forms are beneficial.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The best dosage depends on your current vitamin D status, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-side-effects"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Side Effects &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avoid vitamin D if you're allergic to it or its components (parts). Seek immediate medical attention if you have a &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/anaphylaxis-7375994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;severe allergic reaction&lt;/a&gt; (itching, hives, shortness of breath).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is toxic in excessive amounts. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-toxicity-4776094" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt; is possible from supplements, not food or sun exposure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/too-much-vitamin-d-8401436" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Too much vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; increases calcium absorption in the digestive tract, contributing to high calcium (hypercalcemia). In severe cases, vitamin D toxicity causes kidney failure, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/calcification-5235494" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;calcification&lt;/a&gt; of soft tissue throughout the body, heart issues, and even death.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of the health effects associated with excessive intake, the tolerable upper limit for vitamin D is 4,000 IU daily for women ages 9 and older and those who are pregnant and lactating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_77-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Be mindful of vitamin D when using the following medications:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_78-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orlistat&lt;/strong&gt;: The weight-loss drug Orlistat reduces fat and vitamin D absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steroids&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/facts-about-corticosteroids-steroids-188358" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Corticosteroids&lt;/a&gt; (such as prednisone) affect vitamin D metabolism, causing lower vitamin D levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statins&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Cholesterol is essential for the body's production of vitamin D. Statins, which lower cholesterol, may also reduce vitamin D levels. Conversely, taking high doses of supplemental vitamin D may lower the effectiveness of statins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thiazide &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/complete-guide-to-diuretics-1124128" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;diuretics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium's removal from the body. Taking vitamin D supplements with thiazide diuretics can increase calcium absorption, causing hypercalcemia.&lt;/li&gt;

What might all these symptoms have in common? They can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa764"&gt;all be signs of menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could these symptoms hint at a greater story? New research suggests that menopause symptoms are not just immediate hurdles to overcome; they might also hold clues about a person’s future health, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03564-3"&gt;including their risk for conditions like dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, to understand this connection, we must first understand what menopause is and how it affects the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is menopause?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause marks the natural end of a woman’s menstrual periods, typically occurring in their late 40s or early 50s. Officially, menopause describes the specific day when someone has gone a full year without a period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, menopause doesn’t happen overnight. It often starts years earlier with a phase called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa764"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the body prepares for menopause, and hormone levels — especially estrogen — fluctuate. This transition can last several years, often bringing symptoms like irregular periods, hot flashes, mood swings and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once periods stop completely, a woman enters postmenopause. Unfortunately, symptoms don’t always end here; some may persist for years, and new symptoms may appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stages — perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause — are all part of the same journey, though &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2024.2445303"&gt;each person’s experience is unique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An all too similar patient’s journey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While menopause is a natural process, its &lt;a href="https://www.endo.theclinics.com/article/S0889-8529(22)00037-8/abstract"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can feel anything but. Some people may experience mild or no symptoms, while others struggle with numerous and severe symptoms that disrupt &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/menopause"&gt;daily life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms like anxiety can make socializing difficult, sleep problems can lead to exhaustion and brain fog can make even simple tasks feel daunting. Together, these challenges can affect thoughts, feelings and social lives — key aspects to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why menopause matters beyond the present&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding menopause and its symptoms is just the beginning. Beyond being a transitional phase, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2024.108130"&gt;challenges of menopause&lt;/a&gt; may offer a unique window into future brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia, marked by progressive memory loss, emotional and personality changes, and eventually, a loss of independence. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2020.100879"&gt;Women are twice as likely as men&lt;/a&gt; to develop Alzheimer’s disease. In the past, research thought this difference was because women live longer than men, but new research suggests that menopause-related hormone changes may also play a critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of hormones in brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During menopause, the ovaries stop producing eggs, triggering significant &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/endocrines2040036"&gt;hormonal changes&lt;/a&gt;. One major change is the drop in estrogen, a hormone not only essential for reproduction, but also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-024-05071-4"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen helps protect memory, strengthen neural connections, regulate mood and remove harmful proteins from the brain. When estrogen levels fall, these health benefits may weaken, possibly leaving the brain and body more vulnerable to harmful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these hormonal changes, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ogc.2018.07.004"&gt;menopause symptoms may also emerge&lt;/a&gt;. While symptoms were once thought to be temporary, albeit uncomfortable, side-effects of menopause, these symptoms may also signal underlying brain changes linked to dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future cognitive and behavioural health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While past research has examined how individual menopausal symptoms may relate to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/gme.0000000000001910"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, our research team (led by Dr. Zahinoor Ismail, a physician-scientist) asked: could the number of symptoms experienced also indicate early warning signs of dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explored this by analyzing changes in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cognition (for example, memory, thinking, and problem-solving) and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behaviour (for example, emotions, personality, and social interactions).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cognitive changes are often top of mind when thinking about dementia, behavioural changes are equally important but frequently overlooked, and might also be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2024.02.006"&gt;early warning signs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined data from 896 postmenopausal participants in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahr.2024.100207"&gt;CAN-PROTECT study&lt;/a&gt;, an online Canadian project on aging and brain health. Participants recalled the type and number of symptoms they experienced during perimenopause and completed tests assessing their current cognition and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the participants, 74.3 per cent experienced perimenopausal symptoms — an average four symptoms per person — with hot flashes (88 per cent) and night sweats (70 per cent) being most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301165"&gt;Our findings&lt;/a&gt; revealed that experiencing more symptoms during perimenopause was associated with greater cognitive and behavioural changes later in life, suggesting the burden of perimenopausal symptoms not only affected immediate well-being, but could also signal long-term brain health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, these findings highlight the importance of recognizing menopausal symptoms as potential early indicators of future brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants who used estrogen-based hormone therapies for perimenopausal symptoms showed fewer behavioural changes than non-users, suggesting a possible role for estrogen in dementia risk reduction. However, further research is critical &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt1288"&gt;to clarify the timing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i8.412"&gt;long-term effects&lt;/a&gt; of hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that these findings show a relationship between symptom burden and later brain health, but do not prove that one causes the other. We still need more research to understand why a connection exists and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this research matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research highlights a crucial link: experiencing multiple perimenopausal symptoms may be related to cognitive and behavioural changes, which are early risk markers of dementia. Recognizing these symptoms as potential warning signs could help health care providers identify risks sooner and explore ways to protect brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause is more than a life transition; it may offer critical insights into long-term brain health. Supporting research like &lt;a href="https://www.can-protect.ca/"&gt;CAN-PROTECT&lt;/a&gt;, which is still recruiting participants, can help us uncover how menopause experiences shape dementia risk, paving the way for earlier interventions and better outcomes.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253216/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253216/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

        &lt;p&gt;Genetic defects are exceedingly common, which is not surprising considering just how many cells make up our bodies, including our reproductive cells. While most of these defects have no or only minor effects, some range from serious to fatal. One of these defects is in the CPS1 gene, with those affected facing a shortened lifespan along with intensive treatments and a liver transplant as the only real solution. This may now be changing, after &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/infant-rare-incurable-disease-first-successfully-receive-personalized-gene-therapy-treatment" target="_blank"&gt;the first successful genetic treatment&lt;/a&gt; of an infant with CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase_I" target="_blank"&gt;CPS1&lt;/a&gt;) is an enzyme that is crucial for breaking down the ammonia that is formed when proteins are broken down. If the body doesn’t produce enough of this enzyme in the liver, ammonia will accumulate in the blood, eventually reaching levels where it will affect primarily the nervous system. As an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder it requires both parents to be carriers, with the severity depending on the exact mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the affected infant, KJ Muldoon, the CPS1 deficiency was severe with only a low-protein diet and ammonia-lowering (nitrogen scavenging) medication keeping the child alive while a search for a donor liver had begun. It is in this context that in a few months time a CRISPR-Cas9 therapy was developed that so far appears to fixing the faulty genes in the liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;

(Credit: Yikrazuul, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Urea_cycle.svg?useskin=vector" target="_blank"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its toxicity to living beings, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia" target="_blank"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is an essential part of these same living beings, primarily in the form of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amine" target="_blank"&gt;amines&lt;/a&gt; (R-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), itself a rather indispensable part of amino acids, specifically the 22 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinogenic_amino_acid" target="_blank"&gt;proteinogenic amino acids&lt;/a&gt; from which proteins are formed. Just as ammonia is required for the amination process, so too is ammonia formed inside the body mostly as the result of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transamination" target="_blank"&gt;transamination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deamination" target="_blank"&gt;deamination&lt;/a&gt; of these biogenic amines. This is a process that takes place primarily in the liver and involves the deamination of both the body’s own waste proteins as well as those from one’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only part of the ammonia can be reused for new amino acids, the rest has to be neutralized. Due to the toxicity of ammonia, blood levels have to be limited to &amp;lt;50 µmol/L or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperammonemia" target="_blank"&gt;hyperammonemia&lt;/a&gt; will occur. This is where the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle" target="_blank"&gt;urea cycle&lt;/a&gt; comes into play to maintain a healthy ammonia level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first step of the urea cycle is the conversion of ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;span class="chemf nowrap"&gt;HCO&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; + 2&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate" target="_blank"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt; → 2ADP + Carbamoyl phosphate + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally this is a very slow reaction, which is where the enzyme CSP1 comes into play as catalyst. In humans the gene for this enzyme is located on chromosome 2’s long arm, at locus 2q34. If there is a mutation in this gene that prevents it from working as a catalyst, ammonia levels in blood plasma will keep rising, eventually reaching levels where the nervous system is affected. In infants this is noticeable as lethargy, seizures and a lack of normal developmental milestones. Without treatment, developmental delay, intellectual disability or death affect 50% of babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Undoing A Mutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When KJ was born on August 2024, it was noticed that he was lethargic, with stiff muscles and other worrisome symptoms. After a severe CPS1 deficiency was diagnosed via genome sequencing, KJ was hospitalized at only five months old. KJ’s only hope appeared to be a liver transplant and was put on the list for a donor organ, providing a slim hope at best. Meanwhile, a team of researchers started researching the cause of KJ’s CPS1 deficiency and the mutations behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-first-human-to-undergo-in-vivo" target="_blank"&gt;described by Dr. Eric Topol&lt;/a&gt; in his summary of the (paywalled) &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2505721" target="_blank"&gt;paper by Gropman et al.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, both the father and mother were found to be carriers for CPS1 mutations, with the father carrying the truncating Q335X variant and the mother another (E714X). If either mutation could be corrected, the child would have one functional copy and theoretically be able to produce enough CPS1 to have a functional urea cycle without external assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complicating issue here is that despite the many reports of gene-editing with CRISPR the past years, there are various gradations, with what Dr. Topol refers to as CRISPR 1.0 through 3.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRISPR 1.0: A CRISPR-Cas9 tool causes sufficient double-strand damage to disable the gene (knock-out). Crude and not relevant here. Also performed &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRISPR 2.0: Introduced single-strand cuts that allow for limited base editing, e.g. swapping A for a G.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRISPR 3.0. Expands base editing to include multiple base pairs, both &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods have previously already been used &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; to create &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/11/27/car-t-cell-immunotherapy-and-the-quiet-hope-for-a-universal-cancer-treatment/"&gt;modified T-cells for CAR T-cell immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; in the context of cancer treatments. In terms of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; treatments, there is the 2023 knocking out of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/base-editing-a-new-form-of-gene-therapy-sharply-lowers-bad-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;PCSK9 liver protein&lt;/a&gt; to reduce bad cholesterol levels and the more recent base editing of the &lt;a href="https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-positive-initial-data-beam-302-phase" target="_blank"&gt;PiZ mutation&lt;/a&gt; responsible for liver and lung damage. There’s also &lt;a href="https://precisionbiosciences.com/arcus-genome-editing/" target="_blank"&gt;ARCUS&lt;/a&gt;, which is a viral vector-based method of base editing that has seen use in fixing another urea cycle-related disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although only CRISPR 2.0 was needed here, what was unique in the case of KJ was that this would be the first fully personalized base editing therapy, applied &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and developed within the span of a mere six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing All The Ts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With how experimental this gene therapy for KJ’s CPS1 disorder was, the researchers had to go through the entire gamut of tests, including on animal models. With a base editor developed to target the father’s Q335X mutation and rewrite it to the correct base pairs, mice were bred that had the same CSP1 mutation, in addition to testing on non-human primates, all to validate the approach and gain FDA approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base editor’s goal was to rewrite the the wrong bases at the Q335X location on locus 2q34. A concern with any application of CRISPR is so-called off-target edits, but the safety review seems to have passed here without serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with a very low dose, blood plasma ammonia levels were carefully monitored with no noticeable changes. Three weeks later the second, higher dose was injected, with reportedly positive effects on the ammonia levels. A third dose was injected a while later, though the results of this aren’t know yet. In the absence of a liver biopsy it is hard to say in how far this is a true cure, as reported so far is a reduced need for medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per reports, KJ is however doing better, hitting developmental targets and got over two viral infections, without an ammonia crisis. Further injections of the treatment will likely administered with an mRNA approach rather than the (presumed) virus vector used so far due to immunity concerns with a virus vector. Open questions remain regarding how many cells have been truly edited in KJ’s liver and what the overall effectiveness is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to cautiously welcome this news as a step forward in personalized gene-therapy, while realizing that the road ahead for both KJ and the rest of us is still full of unknowns and challenges. That said, one can only hope for KJ’s best possible progress and ideally serving as a beacon of hope for others afflicted by genetic disorders like CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
