These cells, previously thought to only enter the brain during disease, were most concentrated in a region that regulates hunger and thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that T cells travel from the gut to the brain, potentially delivering real-time updates about the body’s status. This groundbreaking discovery reveals a new dimension of the gut-brain axis, where immune cells may serve as messengers shaping behavior and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Presence:&lt;/strong&gt; T cells inhabit healthy brains, particularly in the subfornical organ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut-Brain Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; T cells originate in the gut and are influenced by the gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing brain T cells alters food-seeking behavior in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brain is a unique place. It is shielded from much of the body by the blood-brain barrier, meaning it’s protected from pathogens and potentially dangerous substances that might be in our blood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And historically, many scientists believed that separation extended to the immune system as well: The brain has its own specialized immune cells called microglia, but immune cells present in the rest of the body were long thought to steer clear of the brain unless there was a disease or other problem requiring their presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of scientists from Yale School of Medicine (YSM) has shown that immune cells known as T cells reside in the healthy brains of mice and humans, trafficked there from the gut and fat. This is the first time T cells have been shown to inhabit the brain under normal, non-diseased conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published May 28 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of T cells in the healthy brain and evidence that they travel between the brain and other parts of the body upend the field’s dogma about the role of T cells in the brain, the study authors say. Pathologists have seen T cells in the brain before, but it was assumed they were there responding to current or previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of T cells as something that fights off infection and causes autoimmune disease, but the surprise of this study is that T cells have a different role in biology that we were unaware of,” says David Hafler, MD, William S. and Lois Stiles Edgerly Professor of Neurology at YSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this paper, we’ve definitively shown that their presence is not just disease-related but part of normal physiology, and that changes everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found T cells most densely concentrated in a small region called the subfornical organ, which is nestled deep inside the brain and is known to regulate thirst and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found the cells in the subfornical organs of laboratory mice and of people who had died and donated their brains to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the brain also has a slightly leaky blood-brain-barrier, which researchers believe allows cells in this brain region to more readily receive signals from the blood to know when its host animal needs to drink or eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This makes it all the more interesting that immune cells are also there, presumably to provide some kind of signal about the body’s normal state,” says Tomomi Yoshida, a YSM doctoral student and first author of the study. Yoshida led the work along with Andrew Wang, MD, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine and immunobiology, and Hafler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Relaying signals from the gut to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T cells perform many different functions, and researchers often categorize this broad class of immune cells into finer subclasses based on the kinds of proteins they display on their surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the brain’s T cells through this lens, the YSM researchers found that they were different from the T cells present in the membrane that surrounds the brain and were most similar to those that reside in the gut and fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, altering the gut microbiome affected the transport of these T cells to the brain. The researchers found that when baby mice weaned and started on solid food, the corresponding shift in their gut microbiomes kicked off T cells’ travel from gut to brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice reared in a germ-free environment, with no gut microbiomes, didn’t have T cells in their brains. And depleting the animals of the brain T cells changed their food-seeking behavior when the mice were offered food following a short fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that the immune cells may be signaling the status of the body to the brain through a previously undiscovered form of gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highway of information between the digestive system and the brain, also called the gut-brain axis, plays many important roles in our health and well-being, but previous studies had not uncovered a direct route for immune cells to enter the brain from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other means of gut-brain communication include the vagus nerve, which directly connects the brain to the intestines, and small molecules secreted into the blood. Relying on the diffusion of molecules in the blood struck Wang as an inefficient method of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a design principle, it seems kind of a risky way to send information,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How cool would it be if you actually reprogrammed an immune cell to represent the state of the gut and you then send that cell to the brain, where it can tell the brain what it saw and allow the brain to adapt based on that information?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what Wang and his colleagues think is happening. The T cells could be telling the brain about the body’s nutrition status, but they could also be conveying other important signals such as the state of the gut microbiome, the researchers hypothesize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang believes they might be stopping in fat tissue on their way from the gut to the brain as a sort of quality-control checkpoint, but that remains to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists next want to look at how the T cells know to move from the gut to the brain as well as what happens to these cells in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study raises more questions than it answers,” says Yoshida. “But they’re all interesting questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research reported in this news article was supported by the National Institutes of Health (awards R01AI162645, R01AR080104, P01AI073748, R01AI22220, UM1HG009390, P01AI039671, P50CA121974, R01CA227473, 1F31NS130957-01A1, DP1DA050986, and R37AR40072) and Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was also supported by the Smith Family Foundation, the Colton Center for Autoimmunity at Yale, the Food and Allergy Science Initiative, the PEW Charitable Trusts, the Mathers Family Foundation, the Ludwig Family Foundation, the Knights of Columbus, Race to Erase MS, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the National MS Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Tompa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Tompa – Yale&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09050-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The subfornical organ is a nucleus for gut-derived T cells that regulate behaviour&lt;/a&gt;” by David Hafler et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The subfornical organ is a nucleus for gut-derived T cells that regulate behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the organization estimates that more than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with it and nearly 53,000 will die from it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbd0z2xq00003b6mygdumboq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New studies presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in the last few days offer promising findings for both pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions, including the impact of diet and exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00053b6mkmbsux8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diagnoses of colorectal cancer have been decreasing overall for decades, the American Cancer Society says, thanks in large part to better screening. But case rates are rising among younger adults, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/health/colorectal-cancer-young-age-mystery"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;estimates that colorectal cancer will become the leading cause of cancer death among adults ages 20 to 49 by 2030.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00073b6mwjgkf0zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier research has suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/colon-cancer-exercise-wellness"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; can improve survival rates for colorectal cancer patients, and a new study – published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the ASCO conference on Sunday – confirmed those findings with robust clinical trial data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00083b6mj83awgmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Between 2009 and 2024, researchers followed nearly 900 colon cancer patients who had completed chemotherapy – half of whom received an informational booklet that encouraged them to adopt a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and exercise the other half of whom were also matched with a physical activity consultant for three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00093b6mkyy9gqe5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found that there was a 28% reduction in the risk of recurrence or new cancer for patients on the exercise program, with a five-year disease-free survival rate of 80% for the group with an exercise consultant compared with 74% for the group who just received the booklet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000a3b6mf89d2s1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, the exercise program was found to prevent 1 out of every 16 patients from developing recurrent or new cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000b3b6m9m2cz2c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That magnitude is comparable to – and in many cases exceeds – the magnitude of benefit offered by a lot of our very good standard cancer drugs,” said Dr. Christopher Booth, a professor of oncology with Queen’s University and co-author of the new study. “Exercise really should be considered an essential component of treatment of colon cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000c3b6mr1f8bh4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Work is still being done to understand why exercise can help reduce the risk of cancer, but experts say that it may have something to do with the ways exercise helps reduce inflammation in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000d3b6mqesnc4n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244419" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; presented at the ASCO conference on Sunday found that anti-inflammatory diets also helped improve survival rates for people with stage 3 colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000e3b6mvb9cpfp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients who consumed more anti-inflammatory diets – including coffee, tea and vegetables such as leafy greens – and engaged in higher levels of physical activity had a 63% lower risk of death compared to patients who consumed the most inflammatory diets – including things like red meat, processed meat, refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages – and engaged in lower levels of physical activity, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000f3b6ml3iz34ip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Actively, as a field, we’re learning about the role of the immune system in cancer development, and inflammation is an immune response,” said Dr. Sara Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the study, and the rise of colorectal cancer cases in younger people suggests it’s a critical piece of the puzzle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000g3b6md2k4f34q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the incidence of colon cancer in younger individuals … that really suggests to us that there is something in the environment – either in the foods we eat, our lifestyles, the chemicals that could be in our foods, all sorts of different things – that are outside of just genetics alone that could be driving these rates,” she said. “So it is incredibly important for us, as a field, to be thinking about how our diet and lifestyle impacts not just our risk of developing this cancer, but then how people fare after it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000h3b6mi7bfcoz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Booth and Char said that colorectal cancer patients are often seeking ways to proactively manage their risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000i3b6ma0mugc7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s it’s very empowering for patients,” Booth said. “It’s also achievable for patients. This is a commitment, but it’s something that patients can achieve.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000j3b6mok7uwtp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his study, an “exercise prescription” was developed based on each individual’s starting point. Most people were able to reach their target increase if they went for a brisk walk for about an hour three or four days per week, Booth said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000k3b6mw5g7xq1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle interventions like exercise and diet are also “sustainable for health systems,” he said, but it’s key that the system helps support patients in accessing the resources needed for behavioral interventions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbd1163l00023b6m4hor6zj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new study showed promising results that might represent a new standard-of-care for certain patients with advanced colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000l3b6mq6pzopzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, drugmaker Pfizer presented &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on a colorectal cancer drug, Braftovi,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;used in combination with a standard chemotherapy and an antibody drug. During the trial, the drug combo was shown to double the length of time patients with an aggressive form of colorectal cancer lived with treatment: an average of 30 months compared with 15 months using currently available treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000m3b6myxj3ye32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Braftovi targets a mutation in a specific protein that can lead to abnormal cell growth, and it’s already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat some forms of cancer. The study, which was funded by Pfizer, published Friday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000n3b6m0s8hajvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a targeted cancer therapy that really depends on knowing what’s driving patients’ cancer,” Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla told CNN. These targeted therapies are one of the biggest advancements in cancer treatment over the past two decades, he said, and it’s easy to diagnose whether cancer patients have the specific mutation that Braftovi can treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000o3b6map65qocy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest data on treatment for colorectal cancer a “very, very important finding,” Bourla said, and the drugmaker plans to seek additional approval to add the new indication to the drug’s label.

My baby now has measles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alex said she posted her son's illness online to warn others over the dangers of the measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was alerted to the infection by the daycare, and immediately isolated her baby — thinking for the first few days that they were in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on April 10, the little boy developed a mild fever, became sluggish and had congestion and a cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After she took him to see a doctor on April 13, she was told they could see small, white spots on the inside of his cheeks — a sign of a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day an angry, red rash erupted, which spread down from his hairline to his face before eventually overtaking his whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worried mother-of-two posted videos of her son's rash online, where her baby appeared tearful, listless and completely covered in the rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex was extremely concerned her son's infection could turn fatal or leave him with lasting side effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hereforworkoutvideos"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: 'Apart from brain swelling, I’m mostly concerned about secondary &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-5429fc70-3caa-11f0-a211-0308852b4ca6" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles can cause brain inflammation, also known as encephalitis. It is a serious side effect of the virus and can cause permanent brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports it occurs in about one in 1,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, pneumonia can lead to septic shock, respiratory failure and even kidney and lung damage.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with an infected person able to pass the disease to nine out of 10 people exposed who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is particularly dangerous to young children, with the CDC saying one in 20 unvaccinated children who are infected develop pneumonia while one in 1,000 suffer from encephalitis — swelling of the brain that can cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to three in every 1,000 unvaccinated children who are infected die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people commenting on Alex's videos were quick to say the disease did not appear to be a mild illness, with some even saying it motivated them to get their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'My mother told me measles wasn't that bad when I told her I won't travel with my baby because of the outbreak. I sent her this and she changed her mind. My heart hurts for your baby.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second said: 'I'm so sorry your little angel is going through this. My son got his six months shots today, and I elected to get the MMR early because of your video.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is in the grips of America's &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7075977/US-measles-outbreak-worst-1994-900-infected-26-states-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;biggest measles outbreak in two decades&lt;/a&gt; — mostly among young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two young and unvaccinated girls, ages six and eight, have died as a result of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with an infected person able to pass the disease to nine out of 10 people exposed who are unvaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two days of the rash, Alex posted it was beginning to calm down — saying she felt they were now over the worst of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her son was not hospitalized for the disease, but was treated at home to help reduce the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video, she detailed what she gave to her son to help with the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She gave him Tylenol and Motrin for the fever and budesonide, a prescription drug used to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also received antibiotics to head-off any secondary infections, because measles weakens the immune system — raising the risk of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother only let her baby sleep lying down on her chest throughout the illness, and kept using cool baths and washcloths to try to lower his temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also gave him the probiotic Ther-Biotic Baby for his gut, and cod liver oil - an unproven remedy touted by Robert F Kennedy Jr - to boost his levels of Vitamin A and D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her baby had mostly recovered by April 17, with his rash having disappeared. Alex showed him crawling and smiling again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother said she posted her son's illness online to warn others over measles, with doctors being quick to comment saying this was the first modern case recorded publicly that they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex has another child who has been vaccinated against measles, and she said she was not pro- or anti-vaccine, but felt it was important for everyone to work together to stop the disease from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 11:26:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQktJTDB2QWNNZzczOVRmR3JzOTNZd0tHZ1VGd1h3RWx3WXhjSVFLNUhMT0ZtZEZ2NklvWnN1WjN6ODVKWXI0NWxtWVpFSVRFRmJfSXdPY2VwQnh2ZjVvN1R1TER0TUlaZmJPalU1cl9lSlVESjRTRTdBcVlDUC1admpDZFE4ZzlXb3A0RFVwWlBCb2FVS3VDOUcyZVBTREFMMXpadG54VmFTYnF00gGyAUFVX3lxTE80QzdhWW56eWtPT05sLW5GSmpIMGJzaEFRSHk3dVc4TGpKNEFpRFNBTDU3Zk5DbERXdHQxZEd0blFHSElmdFotVjFIcmlFVTRoYWJwZW5ieFhNMklOQVhYYkV0N05sM3d0VUdqQm0yNlVCTnBqaVoyb0l4N0g0dTAwQnladGdoYlFVTUdYMlZ0S2VqdzYweXVYWHdPRVBWS0RNOGp3QWZKRGZ3RHNKLXg5N3c</guid></item><item><title>根据科学家的说法，这是恢复肠道健康的最重要的事情- SciTechDaily | According to Scientists, This Is the Most Important Thing To Restore Your Gut Health - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNR3N5TUJWU1hFX2ZmLV9Fb3duMmxENHFEemVaZERmQmRnRUo2a09JRjZzTGtuZ2dmRGVSSVY0RkNkY0h6ZmR1XzBDN3EteW1iVkxncXQ1RUZMRnJuTFRXZ0pCanZIZWtDZng3b0dxcDU4NG5ObGtqWTJBaTExWnpKNm0yaTBFMy01ZVJCNzVwdlhIRXdGY1pqSVlndWdsNm9zRmdwYllmVThObXA4NGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 11:04:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNR3N5TUJWU1hFX2ZmLV9Fb3duMmxENHFEemVaZERmQmRnRUo2a09JRjZzTGtuZ2dmRGVSSVY0RkNkY0h6ZmR1XzBDN3EteW1iVkxncXQ1RUZMRnJuTFRXZ0pCanZIZWtDZng3b0dxcDU4NG5ObGtqWTJBaTExWnpKNm0yaTBFMy01ZVJCNzVwdlhIRXdGY1pqSVlndWdsNm9zRmdwYllmVThObXA4NGc</guid></item><item><title>随着Ozempic的可怕副作用的出现，紧急健康警告-每日邮报 | Urgent health warning as the terrifying side effects of Ozempic emerge - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQbDVfeGw5d3B3UkFMd2VtTHVGTUlQSi1hM01RdzlTSkMzWEVlaXFkMnRoczlMUkNhd3BCbGxXVEJVTFBsT3c4UTV3aVBKRlB4Q2NSR0trYlpEUlUxUURZN0x2cEpQNG9VbzRkemptbE4tWG9XYVg5d1VaU1oxSTV4NVozdEJVOWRtcjdxaTluRdIBlAFBVV95cUxNT2Q3ZHV4dDJGTHpIdlB0YUxNbEE1MlkwNGM3LUdkR0haaWlNdWdSSFlqS0lIRXk1R05hTVFXUXBpNXdSQW9WNDl6V3hIeWdOcFF4aS1VTEhOVDN1aXZDMDVWOG1NTzNGSVc5RHoxeFBuclNZRHJHSFUwS1ljbHRiN2U5cWpMZkpSd2J2cXVrNXRkVTFW?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dozens of Aussie &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-68c4a590-3ec6-11f0-89a9-49d7494d6be9"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; drug injection patients have complained of symptoms consistent with drug-induced hepatitis, sparking a warning from experts for regular GP check-ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients on GLP-1 agonists Wegovy and Ozempic reported flu-like symptoms, fatigue, abdominal cramps and vomiting, thought to be related to liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most severe cases were rushed to hospital after experiencing symptoms associated with inflammation of the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has received three separate reports of hepatitis or liver injury associated with semaglutide medicine use – marketed as Ozempic and Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two patients were on Ozempic while the other was &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13698545/Wegovy-Ozempic-sister-drug-sold-Australia-days.html"&gt;using Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients on Mounjaro have also expressed concerns online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Any of you on Mounjaro have had to stop taking it due to it affecting your liver?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, kinesiology researchers have released a study that establishes a direct link between ultra-processed foods and poor health. Specifically, these foods trigger a response in our bodies similar to the one triggered by contact with a pathogen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflammatory Response to Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that junk food is now a significant public health issue. By the end of 2024, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a disturbing report. According to the report, this type of diet carries hidden health costs that total up to $8.1 trillion, which can represent up to 10% of the GDP in some countries. A major reason is the widespread shift from whole grains to processed products, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These processed, or rather ultra-processed, products are increasingly concerning, as highlighted by a new study published in the journal Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism on May 7, 2025. According to kinesiology researchers from McMaster University in Canada, there’s a strong connection between the consumption of these foods and the production of C-reactive protein (CRP). This protein is produced by the liver in response to an inflammatory or infectious state in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that our bodies perceive these foods as foreign objects and not as food. It’s crucial to note that these aren’t whole foods but rather substances extracted from foods or chemical solutions, causing our bodies to detect them in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Displacing Healthier Food Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers analyzed data from 6,000 individuals in Canada, covering a broad range of ages, health conditions, and socio-economic backgrounds. These participants completed a questionnaire related to a survey conducted by Health Canada, followed by a personal evaluation at mobile clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that on average, participants consumed more than three servings of ultra-processed foods per day, with the highest consumers averaging six servings per day. These high consumers were more likely to be men with lower incomes and lower educational levels. According to the researchers, ultra-processed foods tend to replace healthier options like fruits and vegetables in the diets of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that ultra-processed foods currently account for nearly 45% of the daily energy intake of Canadian citizens aged 20 and older, the concern is warranted. Furthermore, while this study focuses on Canada, similar conclusions could apply to the United States and, to a lesser extent, some European and Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoga and Pilates are two forms of movement that often get grouped together. They each deserve a place in anyone’s routine thanks to their long roll call of benefits for both mind and body, but which is better for beginners? And how can you tell if you would respond better to a yoga flow or a Pilates routine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tina Traina is especially well placed to explain the differences. An experienced yoga and Pilates teacher, Traina is head of the Mind &amp;amp; Body studios at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;David Lloyd Clubs&lt;/a&gt;, where she has devised a yoga-Pilates fusion class that builds strength, alignment, mobility and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of overlaps with some of the exercises and key benefits,” Traina tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “And I wouldn't necessarily steer someone towards one or the other, I would try to incorporate both disciplines in your training.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she adds, there are a few points of difference worth understanding before you sign up to one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-yoga-promotes-greater-mind-body-connection"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Yoga promotes greater mind-body connection &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of yoga involves forging a closer bond between your mind and body by harnessing your breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Jordi Salas / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its centuries-old origins, yoga is a holistic system that incorporates spiritual practices too. Yoga asana (postures)—the movement side of yoga—is just one element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yoga definitely taps into more of the spiritual aspect and the mind-body connection thanks to the inclusion of periods of meditation,” says Traina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, she admits, can put some people off, but the principle is to forge a closer bond between your mind and body by harnessing your breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PDQUZ4gqajJVf6YXtyXXVQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PDQUZ4gqajJVf6YXtyXXVQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In yoga, the breath is mainly used for focus, so you’re using the breath to relax the mind and to focus your energy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-pilates-will-teach-you-to-engage-your-core"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Pilates will teach you to engage your core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pilates there is also a heavy emphasis on controlling your breathing, but it’s primarily used to engage the core. “The breath is into the ribs and the focus is on diaphragmatic breathing, breathing to engage the core muscles,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastering diaphragmatic breathing will help you learn how to subconsciously activate your core muscles to support your spine when performing strength exercises and lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-yoga-tends-to-involve-more-full-body-movements"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Yoga tends to involve more full-body movements &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an extensive collection of postures for teachers to draw from, it’s rare that you won't engage your whole body when practising yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilates, by contrast, “tends to involve higher repetitions of individual movements focused on body alignment” that will target individual muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can make Pilates a safer option if you need to manage a lingering injury, allowing you to precisely target muscle groups and avoid vulnerable joints, although both Pilates and yoga teachers will be able to adjust a class to suit existing injuries—just make sure you speak up and let them know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-pilates-drills-more-precise-body-alignment"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Pilates drills more precise body alignment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Catherine Delahaye / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both yoga and Pilates are typically low-impact, making them a wise choice for beginners and older adults, the pace and tempo of each can vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the type of class, a yoga flow might follow a slower, more restorative tempo, or be more dynamic and fast-paced, which is usually an Ashtanga style,” says Traina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater emphasis is also placed on listening to your body and being free in the movement, she adds, while Pilates instructors tend to encourage a more precise body alignment with each pose to promote better posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-pilates-is-safer-if-you-are-hypermobile"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pilates is safer if you are hypermobile &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most commonly assumed points of difference is that yoga improves flexibility, whereas Pilates builds strength. In reality, both disciplines can build strength and flexibility, but some bodies might respond better to one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Hypermobility_Syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Hypermobility_Syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;hypermobile&lt;/a&gt;, and have naturally looser connective tissue around your joints and ligaments, you might be better off building strength through Pilates-based movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn't say one stretch is better in Pilates and another is better in yoga,” says Traina. “There is just a different focus on them.” Yoga postures, for example, tend to be held for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Pilates, you might be stretching into repetitions, but you will still benefit from mobile joints and stretched muscles that will support better posture in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee has antioxidants that may lower your risk of disease when consumed in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much caffeine can cause heart issues, anxiety and poor sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee isn’t harmful in moderation, but it can't make up for an unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My husband can’t start the day without his morning coffee. He’s not the kind of guy who can wait to get to the office before having some coffee. On workdays, he wakes up as much as two hours early to make sure that he has time to prepare and enjoy his cups of joe. In other words, it’s very much a lifestyle for him. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; His stringent adherence to his ritual makes me worry. I’m a tea drinker and enjoy a bag of green or black leaves every morning, but if I need to go without it, I can. I don’t mind the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-coffee-makers-8415084" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;our coffee makers&lt;/a&gt; are seemingly always at work. But in recent months, I have grown concerned about my husband’s health, as he has started drinking around a pot of coffee by himself each day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Is his habit harmless or harmful? I spoke with health experts and dug into the science to find out. Here’s what I learned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-first-the-good-news"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; First, the Good News &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wholehealthnutritionvt.com/our-team-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Susie Polgreen, M.S., RD, CD, IFNCP&lt;/a&gt;, is almost as committed to her coffee as my husband is. She grinds locally roasted beans each morning and adds organic half-and-half. “There's really compelling research that shows a lot of health benefits with regular coffee consumption,” she says. “The thing I like to point out is that coffee mainly contains caffeine and something called polyphenols.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polyphenols, she explains, are molecules with antioxidant properties that can fight the body’s cell damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Polyphenols are also warriors against inflammation. In fact, research shows that compounds in coffee (including chlorogenic acid, diterpenes and trigonelline) have been found to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mitigate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; and stave off degenerative disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is a laundry list of ailments whose prevention has been linked to regular, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt;, primarily attributed to a combination of caffeine and polyphenols. Those include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, chronic kidney disease and liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us grew up being told that caffeine was detrimental to our health, but in many cases, that school of thought is now démodé. &lt;a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/stephanie-coulter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephanie Coulter, M.D., FACC, FASE&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist, points to a 2023 review on the impact of coffee consumption on cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The meta-analysis of 17 recent studies, which looked at more than 230,000 participants, found that “moderate coffee consumption leads to a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality, hypertension, cholesterol, heart failure and atrial fibrillation.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Most of the studies and observational data sets have shown that moderate consumption is associated with less risk,” Coulter adds. “That means that if it’s something that you love to enjoy, at best it may be good for you in moderation, but at worst, it’s not harming you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-risks-of-too-much-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Risks of Too Much Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, if you drink coffee moderately, you’re probably in the clear. But what about if you’re like my husband? The first issue that Coulter brings up is sleep. In 2022, the American Heart Association added sleep to its official checklist of cardiovascular health factors, alongside diet and physical activity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Coulter cautions that drinking too much coffee too close to bedtime (usually meaning after 6 p.m.) could interfere with that vital rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coulter explains that 400 milligrams or less of caffeine a day is considered moderate consumption, which is what health authorities recommend as the upper limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s the amount you’ll find in about four cups of coffee. My husband often drinks more than that, so is he at risk, even if his sleep is usually not disrupted by drinking a steamy mug with dessert?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coulter and Polgreen highlight that the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;signs of too much caffeine&lt;/a&gt; include an elevated heart rate, palpitations and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, as well as anxiety and headache. ”We know without a shadow of the doubt that people with lower blood pressures on average as they age have less heart failure, less heart attack, less stroke, less kidney disease and, even better, less cognitive decline, so overconsuming any substances that raise your blood pressure over time probably is not beneficial,” says Coulter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polgreen says that she considers one or two cups a day to be safest for her clients. Though the cardiovascular issues are cumulative with regular caffeine consumption, others—like anxiety—can be a daily battle. That’s because caffeine may elevate your cortisol, a stress hormone. But fortunately, coffee lover Polgreen has a hack for that. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You never want to drink coffee on an empty stomach because what that does is it could actually spike your cortisol,” Polgreen explains. “So even adding in something small with that coffee in the morning can make people feel a lot more regulated throughout the day.” She recommends waiting until after breakfast to have your first cup. Can’t bear the wait? She says that even a protein bar or a handful of nuts could lower your post-java jitters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-does-timing-matter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Does Timing Matter? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In short, it probably does. A new study of American adults and their mortality relating to the timing of their coffee drinking found that people who took their coffee in the morning had a lower risk of early death tied to cardiovascular disease than those who enjoyed it throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why? As Coulter mentioned, sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining your heart's health and well-being. However, there is also some evidence that coffee can act as a balm to inflammation that can reach its peak just after we wake up. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another advantage to drinking coffee first thing in the morning? It can help you poop. Just as you stretch out and start your day, your bowels switch from their sleeping state to a state of wakefulness. If you drink your coffee when your gut is most active, it may help to clean out your colon faster.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-so-is-it-okay-to-continue-enjoying-your-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; So, Is It Okay to Continue Enjoying Your Coffee? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From one perspective, coffee is a relatively neutral entity. Black coffee contains a negligible amount of calories, so whatever you add to it might cause more problems than the beans themselves. In fact, if you take your cup with sugar or artificial sweeteners, that may be where inflammation can enter the picture. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polgreen says flavored coffee creamers are one of the worst culprits for sneaking sugar. And while a little added sugar won’t damage your health, excessive consumption increases your risk of chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re looking for another way to boost the flavor, she recommends adding cinnamon to your cup. “Cinnamon has also been shown to be really great for blood sugar regulation, so not only does it taste great, but it does have its own health benefits,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is evidence that limiting added sugar can also be beneficial in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. A new study demonstrated that women who drank two cups of black coffee each day metabolized glucose better than those who didn’t drink coffee on a daily basis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A recent review of other studies on coffee consumption found ties to both longevity and a healthier lifespan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s worth noting that researchers found similar bioactive ingredients in tea and chocolate, so those of us who don’t drink coffee but enjoy either tea or chocolate can reap those benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coulter notes that since stopping at a coffee shop can be expensive, the same health advantages associated with affluence may influence studies of those who drink coffee versus those who don’t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She’s also quick to say that the best thing for people is to take care of themselves, despite the fact that coffee likely has some healthful benefits. That means incorporating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;, such as eating nutrient-dense meals, prioritizing sleep and staying active through regular movement. She mentions that doing these each day has no replacement. “You can't drink coffee to combat a terrible lifestyle,” she says. “You can't get by with being bad by drinking coffee.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite a bit of cynicism in reference to studies, Coulter is convinced that coffee isn’t harmful to the heart, or any other system, for that matter. “The take-home message about coffee is that people have tried to say it's bad for you for decades, and no one can find any strong data in the moderate consumers to suggest that it's true,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The literal take-home message for me? Though there’s nothing wrong with moderate consumption of my husband’s favorite beans, there has been less written about healthy people who drink more than five cups a day. It’s probably time to work on getting down to a couple of cups each morning, after a small meal. But reading up and talking to the experts allayed many of my fears. Coffee, like everything else, requires moderation. Wish me luck as I tell my husband that.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease affects roughly 127.9 million Americans over the age of 20, making it the leading cause of death in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, thanks to ongoing research, it’s becoming easier to prevent, detect and treat heart disease sooner. However, signs of heart disease aren’t always obvious. We spoke with six doctors to better understand eight signs that may indicate a problem and are worth talking to a cardiologist about. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This is likely the most infamous sign of a heart issue. Chest pain may be described as pressure, tightness, heaviness or burning, and it can spread to the arm, neck, jaw or back. Not all chest pain is cardiac-related, but ignoring it can be dangerous,” says &lt;a href="https://welzo.com/pages/dr-blen-tesfu" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Blen Tesfu, MD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sometimes it is important to see a cardiologist sooner [rather] than later. Some symptoms, such as chest pain, could represent a serious heart issue that requires urgent or even emergency care. Evaluating potential heart problems can prevent them from getting worse and maybe even save your life,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center.

You Have Shortness of Breath &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you feel you are short of breath doing regular activities like walking up stairs, carrying groceries or lying down, it could be more than being out of shape,” Tesfu explains. While being short of breath after &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-activity-for-heart-health-recommended-by-cardiologist-8419619" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; isn’t abnormal, if you notice a sudden change that doesn’t improve over time, it’s best to play it safe and talk with a healthcare professional.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tesfu adds, “Shortness of breath may be a sign that not enough blood is flowing out of the heart, which can be a sign of congestive heart failure or valve disease. A cardiologist can check how well your heart is working and determine if there’s an underlying cardiovascular problem that should be addressed.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some other less common signs of heart disease include feelings of rapid heartbeat and dizziness. If someone has feelings of rapid heartbeat (also referred to as palpitations), especially during exertion, this may also indicate significant underlying heart disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.honorhealth.com/physicians/sheharyar-ali" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sheharyar Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While occasional palpitations are typically benign, experiencing them at high frequency or for a longer duration could be a sign of arrhythmias, [which are] irregular heart rhythms that could raise your risk of stroke or cardiac arrest if not addressed,” adds Tesfu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You Have Swelling in Your Legs/Ankles &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chen highlights swelling of the feet or legs as another potential sign of heart disease. When your heart isn’t working as well as it should, it can’t pump blood efficiently and causes a backup of blood in your lower extremities, such as your calves or ankles. This can cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues and result in a type of swelling known as edema.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Temporary swelling in your lower legs is fairly common and typically harmless. Hot weather, injury, high sodium intake, certain medications, pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-common-habit-can-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure-11693146" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sitting for long periods&lt;/a&gt; (like when taking a long flight) can cause extra fluid to pool in your feet or legs. On the other hand, swelling in both legs (bilateral swelling) that does not subside after a few days—especially when accompanied by other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat or fatigue—are signs that should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

It occurs when the force of blood pressing against your artery walls is consistently too high, making your heart work harder than it should. Over time, this added strain can weaken your heart and blood vessels and increase your risk of heart failure. “High blood pressure does not always show symptoms, but over time it can quietly do damage and raise your chances of serious heart problems,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.harleystreet.sg/heart/doctors/dr-michael-ross-macdonald/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Michael Ross MacDonald, MD&lt;/a&gt;, senior cardiologist at The Harley Street Heart and Vascular Centre.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s recommended that healthy adults have their blood pressure checked at least once a year, typically during their annual physical.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can also check your blood pressure using an at-home monitor or at your local pharmacy, though it’s important to note that these methods may not be as accurate as having your levels tested by a trained healthcare professional.

People often assume it’s stress or poor sleep, and many times, that’s exactly what it is.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not uncommon for individuals to experience multiple health conditions, known as comorbidities. Having comorbidities can increase a person’s risk of developing other major health issues, such as heart disease. “Individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol also have a greater risk of developing heart disease and should be evaluated by a cardiologist,” explains Darabant.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Darabant agrees, adding, “A family history of heart disease is another important reason since inherited risks can play a major role in future problems and can strongly influence heart health.” He also emphasizes the importance of prevention through a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;. “Unhealthy habits like smoking, being overweight or not exercising regularly add to the risk and make early cardiovascular intervention even more important,” he says. Of course, regular check-ups are also a smart way to stay on top of your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, it’s best to schedule an appointment with a healthcare professional, ideally a cardiologist. “In cardiology, we’re trained to look for patterns—not just dramatic symptoms, but the quiet ones that often get overlooked. The tricky part is that a lot of these signs could point to something heart-related—or they could be from something else entirely. That’s why context matters so much,” says Cheema. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help prevent or catch heart disease early, it’s critical to schedule regular check-ups with a healthcare professional, such as a cardiologist or primary care physician.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart concerns should always be taken seriously and discussed with a healthcare professional. While people associate heart disease with obvious symptoms, like sudden, sharp chest pain, it can also present in more subtle and even silent ways. Tesfu urges, “If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms—or even if you are just at high risk because of age, lifestyle or family history—a visit to a cardiologist can be a life-saving move.”&lt;br&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big — and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities — are being hollowed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/department-of-health-and-human-services-to-cut-20000-positions-public-health-agencies-hit-hardest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Health and Human Services to lay off 10,000 workers, close agencies in major restructuring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It’s proposing billions more be slashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That’s one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,” Williams said. “It means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping communities healthy saves lives — and money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic’s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,” Cristino said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="How NIH staffing cuts may delay a promising cancer treatment’s implementation" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CScVzOS3J_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won’t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks — if enough people are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mecklenburg County department, with “Protecting and Promoting the Public’s Health” emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You come to work every day and think: What’s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it’s a new disease,” said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg’s director. “That’s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease prevention is unseen — and ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical care can be glamorous — surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It’s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they’ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People don’t appreciate it,” said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. “Therefore, they don’t invest in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mecklenburg — a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people — has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department’s budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center — arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children’s parents and working late into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,” said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. “We don’t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaos in Washington puts ‘lives at risk’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Exploring the potential impact of Medicaid cuts in Trump's big budget bill" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/koPyOXTxYqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were “broken systems” and reprioritizing resources to “centralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cuts are not about abandoning public health — they’re about reforming it,” spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: “We reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today’s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge’s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Columbus, Ohio — one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts — the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cities complained the cuts had created “severe budget uncertainty” and forced them to redirect their limited resources “to respond to the resulting chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,” Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government’s impractical timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current uncertainty puts lives at risk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg’s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With health departments, “there’s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,” said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky’s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California’s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Why public health groups are concerned about changes to COVID vaccine recommendations" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1-yMAVF5HM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation — some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,” said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County’s health director. “What really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. … We were still pretty trim, but we weren’t just, like, bones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 — slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts are not over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC’s budget, enough to cut the agency’s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without the appropriate funding, we can’t properly address these threats,” he said. “We’re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ungar reported from Charlotte and Louisville, Kentucky, and Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island. Associated Press reporters Mary Conlon in Washington and Kenya Hunter in Atlanta contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research on the microbes living in our digestive tract has triggered a '&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503711/"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;' in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, dietary fiber has become the "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;new protein&lt;/a&gt;", leading to it being added to foods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;in abundance&lt;/a&gt; to feed our gut's microbiome and boost our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a study on mice published in 2024 suggests not all fiber supplements are equally beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form that is readily found in oats and barley, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat_beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, can control blood sugar and assist in weight loss among mice fed a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Vienna it was the only type of fiber supplement they tested that decreased a mouse's fat content and body weight within 18 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fibers they considered, including wheat dextrin, pectin, resistant starch, and cellulose, had no such effect, despite shifting the makeup of the mouse microbiome significantly compared to mice fed no fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that fiber is important and beneficial; the problem is that there are so many different types of fiber," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Frank Duca from UA in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know what kind of fiber would be most beneficial for weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis so that we can inform the community, the consumer, and then also inform the agricultural industry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibers are the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/interactions-between-dietary-fibre-and-the-gut-microbiota/0BEF28B809F38D02AC0B1D4E4990210C"&gt;main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria living in our guts, and &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-dietary-fibers-vary"&gt;yet less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the US consume the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/increasing-fiber-intake"&gt;recommended 25–30 grams (0.9–1 ounce)&lt;/a&gt; of fiber a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg" alt="A bowl of oats and some oat grains " class="size-full wp-image-133570" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta-glucan is found in oats and barley.

But fibers are extremely diverse, so which do we choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fibers, like oat beta-glucans and wheat dextrin, are water-&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are easily fermented by gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like cellulose and resistant starch, are less soluble or insoluble, meaning they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/whats-the-difference-between-soluble-and-insoluble-fiber"&gt;stick to other materials to form stool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFoD3F-nlec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Elizabeth Howard from UA and her colleagues, "there is no study that has investigated the role of various fibers in one cohort."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, the current study tested several forms of fiber in one cohort of mice. Only beta-glucan was found to increase the number of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileibacterium"&gt;Ileibacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found in the mouse intestine. Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy011"&gt;studies on mice&lt;/a&gt; have linked this bacterium to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, long before the 10-week marker, mice fed beta-glucan showed reduced body weight and body fat content compared to mice fed other forms of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings align with another recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-023-00767-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Duca, which fed barley flour, rich in beta-glucan, to rodents. Even though the rats continued eating just as much of their high-fat diet as before, their energy expenditure increased and they lost weight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar outcome was observed in mice fed beta-glucan in the new study. These animals also showed increased concentrations of butyrate in their guts, which is a metabolite made when microbes break down fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butyrate induces the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is the natural protein that synthetic drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; mimic to stimulate insulin release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_124692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg" alt="Fingers Hold Ozempic Pen" class="size-medium wp-image-124692" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs mimic the effects of GLP-1. (imyskin/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the benefits of consuming dietary fiber is through the release of GLP-1 and other gut peptides that regulate appetite and body weight," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Duca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, we don't think that's all of the effect. We think that there are other beneficial things that butyrate could be doing that are not gut peptide related, such as improving gut barrier health and targeting peripheral organs like the liver."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed before these results can be extended to humans, but the findings suggest that some fibers may be better suited to weight loss and insulin control than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There were times when they thought they might lose Max. Throughout that period, in and out of the NICU watching their tiny baby, Rogut took “the very male supporting role”. He supported his wife. He was the point of contact if anyone needed to know what was going on. But it felt as though he was in a sensory deprivation tank.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He became detached from everything and anything. “I was very much in survival mode – but trying to keep everyone else sort of above water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Staff would check in and ask, “How’s mum doing today?” No one asked about how Rogut was doing unless his forthright wife told them to. His friends would get in touch, but there wasn’t much they could do. About halfway through the 121 days Max spent in hospital, his wife was diagnosed with postnatal depression, which helped her access support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="91d9d7d9-0b7e-404b-9383-1355f8de8773" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘I didn’t even know men could get it’: the hidden impact of male postnatal depression","elementId":"91d9d7d9-0b7e-404b-9383-1355f8de8773","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/i-didnt-even-know-men-could-get-it-the-hidden-impact-of-male-postnatal-depression"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But yeah, there was nothing really for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Max was born in March. He came home around July. The new family got into a routine. Rogut was problem solving, helping his wife. He had friends around him. It would have looked to the outside world that he was doing OK. That he was being a good dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I didn’t realise how bad I was until about November, December when I hit the wall.” He became clinically depressed, suicidal. He checked into a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; baby is a beautiful thing. But for decades, after years of advocacy, researchers and health systems have recognised that the arrival of a baby can also be a challenging, traumatic, disorienting thing for new mothers. &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/perinatal-mental-health-screening-australia/contents/what-is-perinatal-mental-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Up to one in five mothers&lt;/a&gt; experience perinatal anxiety or depression. As a result, women are screened for their mental health at metronomic points throughout the orchestrated health path from confirmation of pregnancy through to their infant’s routine immunisations. Maternal mental health remains a serious problem, but one for which a system exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is no such system for fathers. And an increasing body of research shows about one in 10 fathers experience serious mental health issues in the period before and after their child is born. It is also showing that the impacts of this are not just devastating for the fathers, but for their partners and their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We don’t have a community where we wrap our arms around fathers in the same way that we do around mothers in the early stages,” says Deakin University Associate Professor Jacqui Macdonald, convener of the Australian Fatherhood Research Consortium. “Instead the language is around fathers being a support for the mother. There’s not a discussion about who the support is for fathers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It means that fathers, like Rogut – but not limited to those who have had traumatic experiences – can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When you think about the challenges facing a first-time father, says Associate Professor Richard Fletcher, who leads the Fathers and Families Research Program at the University of Newcastle, “the context for him having the baby is one that’s like being in a desert and not even being aware of how thirsty you are, but there’s no water anywhere”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The dads are isolated from pretty well everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is not a phenomenon limited to Australia. Dr Sharin Baldwin conducted a systematic review on perinatal mental health in the UK in 2018. “What stands out most is how often men feel invisible or excluded in the perinatal period,” she says. Meanwhile, they were dealing with challenges associated with changes in identity and their relationship, financial pressures and work-life balance.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Not much has changed since then, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Many men suffer in silence during one of the most significant transitions in their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Families don’t work as individuals, they work as systems. So if one part of that system is really struggling, the rest of the system isn’t going to be working as well,” Macdonald says. “If we can care for the father, then the father does provide a better source of care. The father becomes a partner of the healthcare system in supporting the mother and child, but that’s not possible if we haven’t cared for the father as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he figure of 10% of new fathers experiencing mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression, is an estimation. One reason, says Macdonald, is “we don’t really have proper screening anywhere for new fathers”. The second is that male depression often looks quite different from perinatal depression in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“What we do find is very high correlations between feelings of anger. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re aggressive, it just means that there’s an internalised sense of anger,” she says.

This can make the transition to parenthood difficult for men. It is well established that men frequently take longer to bond with their babies than women. But the work of addressing that, says Fletcher, cannot be left up to individual men, operating in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“People think we’ve really got to get those dads to change their attitudes and be more egalitarian. That’s the task. Whereas I would say we’ve got to change the system surrounding conception, pregnancy and birth so that it’s assumed he’s part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Caring and earning dynamics established early in family life can be difficult to untangle, and can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cause long-term conflict when the reality of the division of caring does not cohere with the vision parents had when entering parenthood. Both parties can feel disappointed, says Fletcher – though women often more so, left literally holding the baby if their partner retreats into work, or hobbies, or alcohol as a way of coping with their own distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The chasm between parents’ expectation and experience, between fathers’ needs and support, leaves families fumbling. They’re asking, says Macdonald: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does the system not respond to what we do as a family and what we need?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My hope is that we’re seeing a potential tipping point … where we see the family as a system; where we see both parents as providers, not just fathers, which means both parents are also protectors, both parents are carers, emotional caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But that needs intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="theyre-not-thinking-oh-what-about-me" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘They’re not thinking, “Oh, what about me?”’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The simple thing” that governments could do, says Fletcher, is screen new fathers for anxiety and depression. “I think that’s a basic fundamental thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/02/nhs-to-introduce-mental-health-checks-for-new-fathers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS in the UK introduced screening for fathers&lt;/a&gt; by health visitors when their partners had already been identified as having perinatal mental health problems. Baldwin says it is a positive step, but is only part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“What we really need is a broader cultural and systemic shift that normalises support for fathers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Often when one asks new fathers how they are doing, they are reluctant to identify that they are struggling. Their response, says Fletcher, is: “‘No, look after her.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is a mistake to attribute this to the father’s sense of the need to preserve a stoic masculinity, he argues. “The evidence says that they’re not so much thinking about that they want to be tough and super masculine, but they care for their partner.” They can see that their partner’s needs are most acute. “They’re not thinking, ‘Oh, what about me?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This means the need for services which are specifically targeted towards fathers. A recent trial of an app which asked fathers to track their moods and offered cognitive behavioural therapy interventions, developed by Dr Sam Teague at James Cook University, found an improvement in fathers with anxiety, stress and even those with severe depression. Fathers also reported improved relationships with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Likewise Fletcher, with a team, developed a father-specific mobile-based information support service called SMS4dads which has more than 18,000 fathers signed up. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6796445/#:~:text=Four%20positive%20outcomes%20of%20SMS4dads,relationship%20with%20partners%20%5B41%5D." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;feasibility study for the service &lt;/a&gt;in 2019 found that fathers using the app improved their relationship with their baby and partner, and reduced their sense of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fletcher and Macdonald say the field of advocates and researchers invested in fatherhood is growing, but efforts to support fathers and their families are still often quite piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Macdonald advocates using the universal GP system, and encouraging men in the early stages of fatherhood to attend routine mental and physical health checks – “just full-on dad checks across that period of time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9864e8c7-d6d6-4228-b43b-ee911399f6f0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":51,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why more men are joining the ranks of therapists: ‘We’re rushing to a place we’re needed’","elementId":"9864e8c7-d6d6-4228-b43b-ee911399f6f0","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/dec/15/finding-male-therapists-mens-mental-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A number of practitioners have told us they don’t feel as confident working with fathers, but once there’s training to do this, they feel very confident,” she says.

With the passage of time, Rogut has become able to share his experience. For a few years, around the time of his son’s birthday, tensions would be high in his home, the relationship would struggle. Now, he is a community champion for &lt;a href="https://www.panda.org.au/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;perinatal mental health service Panda&lt;/a&gt;, and even as he trawls through the darkest of his memories, he comes across as confident, open. Things have changed for fathers in the last decade, he says. “We know this happens and there’s more of a spotlight on it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What might have been different if he had been viewed as someone who needed help, too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I don’t think I would have ended up in hospital, to be honest,” he says. He may have received support before he reached his crisis point. “It’s all those kinds of things that we look back on and think, ‘If only’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 20:00:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNVVpNOFlXaERnLWZaQkg3LWhXVGxfVkY0S1BiWmU3cnYwNGFiVUg3Q1Z3bHRBSzhNTnpXWlNVR3FOZF9KMDEzQlB1RUtPSFplLTkydXBFS25idGtCTGY5OXRBTDk4bVpRSkR3a3l5NHFwcS1xdzEyN2Z0TjZNSXMwWWRIT2FMcmFIRXczR05LUGNsY1RDTlo1UjVBZTEycGktbWFTbg</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果你患有糖尿病，你应该吃6种“坏”高蛋白食物来获得肌肉- EatingWell | 6 "Bad" High-Protein Foods You Should Eat to Gain Muscle If You Have Diabetes, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOV2ZyOHRRcU1wX1drazNzNkQyd1ZOR3BqLTAwbnhVRGhlMXhlcXdkdWdHV2MxQlRZcWhzZld1VlAzb3ZkdTI2RnlhTk9LTmRKWHhfS3htWk1sR3VfQ0Y2Y3gzR2N4MWtsSTVXazVNQWJoZ0k5SUdlT3gxMlRWZmNRbzNQU01IOURTTGE3VFRQb2k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein can help build muscle, improve insulin sensitivity and help manage blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some high-protein foods have been unfairly categorized as off-limits for diabetes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say many of these muscle-building proteins may have diabetes benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it can often feel like you’re on a diet of don'ts. A nagging voice in your head might constantly warn you away from a slew of foods that are high in sugar, carbs or even fat. Yet many foods traditionally thought of as “bad” for diabetes are actually loaded with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt; that can help you build muscle. And since more muscle mass means better insulin sensitivity and a stronger,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053663/the-sneaky-way-diabetes-affects-metabolism-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; faster metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, getting plenty of protein is a key part of a healthy diabetes diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes and have been avoiding these protein-rich foods, dietitians say it’s time to welcome them back to the table.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on the nutrition advice you’ve received, you might believe that eating anything but low-fat dairy is a big no-no for diabetes. But diabetes expert&lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, says a higher fat percentage in yogurt isn’t as worrisome as you might think. “People with diabetes are often told to opt for non-fat dairy,” she says. However, full-fat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Greek yogurt's&lt;/a&gt; combo of slowly-digested fat plus roughly 21 grams of protein per cup can make it a filling option that helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stabilize blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, some studies have shown people who consume more calories from dairy fat may have a lower risk of diabetes, especially when compared to calories from carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gone are the days when health experts recommended steering clear of nuts due to their fat content. Current evidence shows that nuts are an excellent choice in a diabetes-friendly diet. One top-notch option:&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; pistachios&lt;/a&gt;.

A 2-ounce serving of pistachios delivers roughly 12 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One small study found that volunteers with prediabetes who consumed 2 daily ounces of pistachios (1 ounce before breakfast and another ounce before dinner) for 12 weeks experienced improvements in blood sugar, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-you-should-start-to-lose-visceral-fat-11698263#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%2C%20or%20belly%20fat,antioxidants%20and%20promoting%20gut%20health." class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and markers of heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite its generally positive reputation, shellfish has received criticism for its high cholesterol content, says&lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. This has led some people with diabetes (and, therefore, increased risk of heart disease) to avoid shellfish like crab, clams, shrimp and oysters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Gaw says people with diabetes can say yes to shellfish on a regular basis. “Shellfish is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, high-quality protein that promotes blood sugar control,” she explains. There’s more good news. One study found that two weekly servings of fish or shellfish may help protect people with a history of cardiovascular disease from future cardiac events and cardiovascular disease-related death.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try a 3-ounce serving of canned crab for 15 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, beef can be beneficial for health, even for people with diabetes. It all comes down to choosing the right cut. While fatty cuts aren’t advised, Gaw says the high protein content of a&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7826527/500-calorie-beef-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; lean cut of beef&lt;/a&gt; like chuck, sirloin, round or top loin can help build muscle while keeping dietary fat to a minimum. Three ounces of trimmed sirloin steak, for example, contains roughly 17 grams of protein with a reasonable 3 grams of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever heard that soy is a bad actor for your health? While rumors abound that soy increases breast cancer risk, impairs mineral absorption or adversely affects male sex hormones, research has shown that these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-soy-you-need-to-stop-believing-11706042" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soy myths&lt;/a&gt; simply aren’t true.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truth is, soy is actually a healthy choice for muscle-building, especially if you prefer a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based meal plan&lt;/a&gt;. “Soy foods are sometimes avoided for containing phytoestrogens and being processed, but foods like tofu are a great source of plant-based protein,” says diabetes expert&lt;a href="http://vandanasheth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Tofu contains all the essential amino acids and supports muscle growth without blood sugar spikes.” One cup of cubed &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7904929/tofu-recipes-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt; contains an impressive 18 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to diabetes, there’s a lot of confusion around beans and lentils. Their relatively high carb content can give the impression that they’re off-limits for people with blood sugar issues. But Shah says these legumes have a unique saving grace, specifically their fiber. “While they are higher in carbs, they have a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower glycemic load&lt;/a&gt; because of their high fiber content,” she explains. This means they won’t raise your blood sugar quickly. In fact, many dietitians consider beans to be among &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994446/best-high-fiber-foods-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;the best high-fiber foods for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Try a cup of cooked lentils for 18 grams of plant-based protein plus a bonus 16 grams of blood sugar-regulating fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As beneficial as protein is, you need to combine it with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; to effectively build muscle. The resulting increased lean mass can deliver a surprising number of diabetes-related health benefits, like these:

Research has found that reducing visceral fat may promote better insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re living with diabetes, it may be time to rethink your go-to list of high-protein foods. Research reveals that lean protein may help build muscle, manage weight, and improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. Dietitians say that some of the high-protein foods people with diabetes sometimes avoid–such as full-fat yogurt, nuts, shellfish, beef, soy, beans and lentils—can actually be a part of a healthy eating plan for diabetes and can help build the muscle you need.

&lt;p&gt;Late-night scrolling isn’t the only thing sabotaging your slumber.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a common daily habit may send your brain into overdrive while you sleep — even if you do it hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists warn the disruption could interfere with the brain’s overnight recovery processes, potentially taking a toll on your &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/04/health/why-tossing-and-turning-at-night-could-increase-risk-of-cognitive-decline-study/"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Caffeine is a stimulant that can make it hard to fall asleep, but it might also affect your brain once you doze off.   &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, Canadian researchers had 40 healthy adults spend two nonconsecutive nights in a sleep lab.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one night, participants consumed 200 milligrams of caffeine — the equivalent of about two cups of coffee — a few hours before bed. On the other, they were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While most people know caffeine can &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/13/health/sleep-expert-says-drinking-coffee-after-noon-causes-insomnia/"&gt;make it harder to fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used EEG scans to track brain activity after participants dozed off and found it kept their brains in a heightened state of alertness long after they shut their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found, for the first time, that the stimulant pushed the brain into a state of “criticality,” making it more awake, alert and reactive than it should be while catching Zzz’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night: the brain would neither relax nor recover properly,” &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/05/29/how-does-coffee-affect-a-sleeping-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie-Carrier-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Julie Carrier&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor at the University of Montreal and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The majority of Americans drink at least one caffeinated beverage daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;sebra – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used artificial intelligence to detect subtle changes in neuronal activity and found that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, preventing the brain from fully powering down during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The effect was especially strong during non-REM sleep — the deep stage critical for memory and cognitive recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also observed changes in brain wave patterns. Slow waves linked to deep, restorative rest were reduced, while faster waves associated with wakefulness and mental activity increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine,” said&lt;a href="http://www.karimjerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Dr. Karim Jerbi&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor at the University of Montreal and researcher at the Mila Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, who co-authored the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This change in the brain’s rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/14/health/sleep-could-help-erase-bad-memories-therapy-for-our-emotions/#!"&gt;memory processing&lt;/a&gt;,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Caffeine increased neural activity during sleep and suppressed slow waves linked to deep, restorative rest.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maryna – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Notably, the stimulant’s effect’s were far more pronounced in participants aged 20 to 27 compared to those aged 41 to 58 — especially during REM sleep, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/health/why-its-easier-for-some-people-to-remember-dreams-than-others/"&gt;dreaming phase&lt;/a&gt; tied to emotional and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe younger adults responded more strongly due to having more adenosine receptors. These molecules gradually accumulate in the brain throughout the day, triggering fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine’s ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants,” Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest younger brains may be especially vulnerable to caffeine’s hidden impact on rest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Caffiene might have an event greater impact on the sleeping brain’s of young people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Svitlana – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world, commonly found in products such as coffee, tea, chocolate, sodas and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/94-percent-of-us-drink-caffeinated-beverages" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 Sleep Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 94% of US adults consume caffeinated beverages, and 64% drink them daily. Of those, 40% said they didn’t think it affected their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;While the &lt;/a&gt;FDA says up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is generally safe for healthy adults, the study suggests it could still be interfering with sleep quality — even hours after your last sip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists are calling for further research exploring how these nighttime brain changes affect day-to-day functioning and cognitive health. This, they said, could one day shape personalized caffeine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

However, his health continued to deteriorate and he was transferred to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could feel myself getting worse. I prepared myself to say my goodbyes to my family, but I wasn't willing to say it. I just said, ‘See you later,’ ” he told The Independent, adding that Alix brought their 2-year-old son and newborn baby to visit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was really hard on myself at the time, but the only way I was going to be happy was by getting home. I was determined to get out and walk again,” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third round of IVIG was successful, and Pickering was transferred out of the ICU and into a rehabilitation center just before Christmas 2023. He was able to walk again by February 2024, though he noted that it wasn’t an easy path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew my body wasn’t ready for it, but you just have to keep doing it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A man in physical therapy (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pickering — who said he still can’t feel his toes — has been home for about a year and is able to live life mostly normally these days.

Symptoms often begins with tingling and weakness in the feet and legs that spreads to the upper body and arms, though some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As GBS progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis — but it does not do so in most cases. For most people, body weakness typically peaks around three weeks after the initial onset of symptoms and then begins to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBS usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50, and often occurs after a viral infection, which in turn triggers an overactive immune response in the patient, according to the clinic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/fathers-tingling-hands-ends-in-him-becoming-paralyzed-guillain-barre-syndrome-11745985" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 19:01:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE00RURhcE1PdXZSR191SHRLYzlHMTdTemh1aTExN2ZrUWpfYVJMMVpaWDY1bTRCNENXQy1iMXRXb0tRbDJobXdnVUVMeElHLTVfendDd0lFWlE2SjVXcTFVU2FUcDdTYVlyeFpaMlBGRHF5OV9l</guid></item><item><title>抗击影响数百万人的致命疾病的疫苗竞赛遭受毁灭性打击-每日邮报 | Devastating blow in race for vaccine against deadly disease that affects millions - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOSnhNSWJHSVJlSnN1Qlg4NGItRVlzTzg3Rkx5VUNhQlFINHNPVjlVd0YyNTlVMmU2c3drRElZUWwtQlh6N292T253QlVKeV9jSVBhVTVGOHdIM01neWVGblJLb3hBXzVnaDNGVml5OTZEblJWOTloVUk0R3pmZUxrOHJSUGlYNlFEcGg0Sm1Sa9IBlAFBVV95cUxNR1k2VDhKcjFJbEJ4WE9XMVpIalRuVWFNWTJlRnU5V2xxVjZKN1NWbDgyRHg0eDNEUjctX05Zb0FSOXFQSHZrOVF3RU1oYWNTako0U2R1dXV4T3ZHWldQcGhvRkxMaWM2azBCNnJJbnBOUV9pbU40LXlJV2pfRDgtMzR4T29uWWNDYXlVbEFCSFVrWlI5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major US research program to develop a vaccine against &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-17de64a0-3e4d-11f0-ac40-af30899e520e"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; has been abruptly canceled by the Trump administration, sparking outrage as prevention efforts stall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The administration's termination of the promising $258million research program stunned scientists, whose years-long project had also benefited the development of treatments for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-9dfe22d0-3e27-11f0-bc91-d9624054564a"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, autoimmune conditions, and even snakebite antivenom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at Duke University and the Scripps Research Institute were informed on Friday that their funding would be cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The consortia for HIV/AIDS vaccine development and immunology was reviewed by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/northern-ireland/index.html" id="mol-9dfc4e10-3e27-11f0-bc91-d9624054564a" class="class"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; leadership, which does not support it moving forward,' a senior official, who asked not to be named, told the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/health/trump-hiv-cuts.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.

'The holy grail of any virus response and the only things that will eventually keep all Americans safe  is a vaccine. A president worthy of the title would want America to be the first country to invent the HIV jab, not walk off the pitch in the eleventh hour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Trump administration has abruptly shut down a $258 million HIV vaccine research program, halting work at Duke University and the Scripps Research Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NIH said it would no longer support the consortia, shifting focus to existing tools for HIV prevention and treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, the United States has led the world in HIV research, pouring billions into cutting-edge science that turned a once-fatal virus into a manageable condition for millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American labs were the first to crack the genetic code of HIV, to develop life-saving antiretroviral drugs, and to pioneer global initiatives like PEPFAR that saved more than 25 million lives worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The now-axed vaccine program was another shining example of US scientific leadership, bringing together top researchers from coast to coast and pushing the boundaries of immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancellation is part of a broader rollback of federal HIV efforts. The NIH has also paused funding for a separate clinical trial of an HIV vaccine developed by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-9df76c10-3e27-11f0-bc91-d9624054564a"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV rates remain high. In 2023 alone the World Health Organization reported 1.3million new infections, including 120,000 children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 32,000 people in the US contracted the virus last year and there was another 4,000 new cases in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some parts of the US, the effects are already being felt. In Texas, the state's Department of Health Services told grantees to pause HIV prevention activities 'until further notice.' In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 10 health department staffers have been laid off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across Africa, several countries are reporting major disruptions in prevention work after delays in US aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The HIV pandemic will never be ended without a vaccine, so killing research on one will end up killing people,' John Moore, an HIV researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College, said.

The research shows that adults with ADHD are more likely to struggle with education, employment, and overall social functioning compared to those without the condition. Even when individuals adhered to prescribed medication over a 10-year period, their outcomes did not significantly improve in key areas such as educational attainment or employment by the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a developmental condition that affects about 2–3% of children, with symptoms often continuing into adulthood. It is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These behaviors can make it difficult to succeed in academic, social, and workplace settings. While medication is commonly prescribed to manage symptoms, the long-term effects of treatment on real-world outcomes like education and employment have not been well studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to understand how adults with ADHD are doing by age 30, and whether sticking to prescribed medication during young adulthood helps improve social outcomes. They also aimed to quantify the broader social and economic impact of ADHD, particularly in terms of healthcare costs and the presence of other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used national data from Denmark’s health and social registries to track individuals diagnosed with ADHD between 1995 and 2016. To be included, patients had to be under 30 years old by 2005 or turn 30 by 2016, which allowed for at least a decade of follow-up data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 4,897 people with ADHD were matched with 18,931 individuals from the general population. Matching was based on age, gender, and location. The researchers then compared the two groups across a range of outcomes, including education level, employment status, income, healthcare use, and psychiatric comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined medication adherence by tracking how consistently ADHD patients filled prescriptions over the 10 years leading up to age 30. Adherence was defined as receiving at least 70% of the defined daily dose in a given year. The researchers then analyzed whether greater adherence led to better social and economic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, adults with ADHD fared significantly worse than their peers in many areas of life by the time they reached 30. Compared to the control group, individuals with ADHD were more likely to live alone, less likely to have completed higher education, less likely to be employed, more likely to rely on social welfare programs, and more likely to have been diagnosed with additional psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 30, only about 35% of adults with ADHD were employed, compared to over 74% in the control group. A striking 34% of those with ADHD were receiving social security benefits, and 12% were on disability pensions — much higher than their non-ADHD peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic picture was also sobering. Adults with ADHD had lower predicted income from employment and significantly higher healthcare costs. On average, they received more than double the amount of public financial support compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health was another key difference. Psychiatric comorbidities were far more common among ADHD patients, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. These additional conditions strongly influenced outcomes: people with more severe psychiatric comorbidities were much less likely to finish school or be employed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the central questions of the study was whether sticking to ADHD medication made a difference. Surprisingly, the answer was no — or at least not in the expected way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adherence to medication between the ages of 21 and 30 did not increase the chances of completing a vocational or college-level education. Nor did it boost the odds of being employed at age 30. In fact, higher adherence to medication was modestly associated with lower odds of being employed, although the researchers believe this may be due to the fact that people with more severe symptoms — and thus worse outcomes — are also the ones who are more likely to stay on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educational outcomes were most strongly predicted by whether the patient’s parents had higher levels of education. Similarly, parental education also influenced whether the individual was employed by age 30. This suggests that family background remains a powerful driver of success, even among those with access to medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged several limitations. One key issue is that the data do not capture the full range of non-medication treatments, such as therapy, special education services, or social support programs. These may play an important role in long-term success but were not included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is that the study design was observational, which means it cannot prove causation. For example, while medication adherence was not linked to better outcomes, this does not mean that medication is ineffective — it may be that the people who need it most already face serious disadvantages that medication alone cannot overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also limited information about the age at which patients were first diagnosed. Many participants received their diagnosis as adults, missing out on early intervention that might have changed their life trajectories. The researchers note that earlier diagnosis and a combination of treatments might lead to better long-term results, but more studies are needed to test this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2025.01.016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Long-term effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on social functioning and health care outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Poul Jennum, Anne Virring Sørensen, Lone Baandrup, Michael Ibsen, Rikke Ibsen, and Jakob Kjellberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 18:03:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNZTcwbGpDaXNPaElzR2pEcWprM2d4QU9YX19SbEs1Q29tWlV3TGlFc0I3U0ZOcTdmVUhEanBkNDgwWWhXZWFCS2x6Zk96eTJ5NXFqVVNYcmhHU1BkMHNpVUlvT3QzMlVCVW9HMlh2SHpRcUhlYnFRRi1ZMC11SGo2MVBFelpRM0p1VGxlckpoZ3BBOWNGOEhPN2VReWJDNjZXSjExb1V3Y2xSWEdjZzdKWGhSbENYbHp3VURJZQ</guid></item><item><title>TikTok上最常见的心理健康错误信息是什么？ -《卫报》 | What is the most common mental health misinformation on TikTok? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNNmYzclVabWt1RlAwaFJnQzl0UlJIeUQwMDlHdjAyNXZhdl80Nl95VE9MZkVjcVRRUm9tRkRZalh5cXpjbHdhZ2lTWEdKOWZpRndqZXMzVWZYZUNVVTUtTG1UMWhwX05tbDNzYWhtZ1FrQkxlNzVsM1JTXzl1NzIwZEdQVjJ3Y1ROVEZycDdkLUdTQ1Bsd2tZMjFodVp5YzRMRy0wdk95QmE0UDRUQ1ZtcndBdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol data-ignore="global-ol-styling"&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="pathologising-normal-emotions" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;Pathologising normal emotions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several videos about borderline personality disorder suggest symptoms that are everyday experiences – such as feeling anxiety when people change plans, experiencing mood swings, a fear of abandonment and mirroring people’s behaviour to be liked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video purports to show how depression manifests in the workplace as a lack of concentration, feeling tired, having low energy levels, a loss of appetite and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While some of the ‘symptoms’ overlap with depression, these can be attributed to a range of afflictions and struggles,” said Liam Modlin, a therapist and psychology researcher at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="misusing-therapeutic-language" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;2. &lt;/span&gt;Misusing therapeutic language&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One video said that people with bipolar disorder experience mood swings because their emotional pendulum swings more widely and rapidly than most. However this is a misunderstanding, since people experience extended mood changes over periods of weeks rather than rapid “mood swings”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is an example of misappropriating a mental health diagnosis to wrongly explain or justify behaviour,” said Dan Poulter, a former health minister and NHS psychiatrist. “A person with bipolar disorder may find this trivialising of their experience of living with a debilitating and serious mental illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another popular video suggests that when someone is about to die by suicide they become “almost bipolar” – “language [that] can further stigmatise mental health”, said Prof Rina Dutta, a consultant psychiatrist and psychiatry professor at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video claims signs of abuse are constantly apologising; breaking down during small disagreements; needing reassurance; struggling to be open; being hypersensitive to criticism, and hiding feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The behaviours it describes, while potentially present in abusive dynamics, are not exclusive to abuse and may occur in a variety of other contexts,” said Modlin. “By presenting these signs without sufficient context or diagnostic nuance, the video risks encouraging viewers to self-diagnose or mislabel complex relational struggles as abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="unevidenced-treatments-and-false-claims" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;Unevidenced treatments and false claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This was the most common form of misinformation contained in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One video promotes a method it said was cheaper than therapy and had fewer side effects than antidepressants that could enable people “to heal from trauma in an hour” and involved writing about the traumatic experiences for 15 minutes non-stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“No research suggests this is sufficient for cure, definitely not in an hour, and there is risk of independently forcing oneself back into this traumatic mindset without the support of an experienced therapist,” said Amber Johnston, an accredited psychotherapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another clip suggests that crying is self-soothing and good for processing emotions, including by stimulating the release of cortisol. “Cortisol changes related to crying are complex and cannot be distilled down in this way,” said Amy Durden, a psychotherapist. “Crying can bring relief but not always. It can be self-soothing but if the person crying judges their crying negatively, they do not experience this benefit and may feel acute shame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several videos featured glib quotations that the experts viewed as unhelpful such as: “If you’re not changing, you’re choosing”, while another popular quotation said: “When you feel like everyone hates you, sleep. When you feel like you hate everyone, eat. When you feel like you hate yourself, shower. And when you feel like everyone hates everyone, go outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is a huge oversimplification of how to address complex emotional states,” said Durden. “It seems to be pulling from behavioural activation in CBT, but without any context or individualisation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A specific breathing technique for treating anxiety was promoted in another video. “There is no single, universally effective breathing technique that is helpful in all cases,” said David Okai, a consultant neuropsychiatrist. “If performed incorrectly, the exercises can be the equivalent of hyperventilation, which can be extremely unpleasant and exacerbate anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video suggests depression is caused by alcohol, tobacco, MSG, caffeine, sugar and hydrolysed wheat. Modlin said that although lifestyle factors can contribute, “this framing is overly simplistic and potentially misleading”, since there are complex interwoven factors, including genetics and neurobiology, psychosocial stressors, childhood adversity, medical conditions and personality styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other clips promote supplements including saffron, magnesium glycinate and holy basil extract to ease anxiety. Although the psychiatrist Famia Askari said there are some studies showing benefits to some of these, there is not sufficient consensus for these to have become part of clinical practice – they are also manufactured supplements, in contrast to the “natural” claims that featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="anecdotal-evidence" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;4. &lt;/span&gt;Anecdotal evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two videos recommend admission to psychiatric units based on personal experience, including one suggesting someone had considerably improved after six days, and another offering a template for children to ask their parents to have them admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Poulter said this was “misleading” and can “create misconceptions” about the benefits of inpatient admission. “Inpatient admission can in fact create and reinforce maladaptive coping mechanisms,” he said. “It is also very rare that someone would be driving themselves into mental health hospital in the way depicted by the video.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video depicts someone in a hospital gown in what appears to be a psychiatric ward stating: “I was too honest with my psychiatrist.” This could be harmful as it is “potentially encouraging people to not be honest and open with healthcare professionals about their mental health”, said Poulter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In another clip, a woman gives her strategies for managing anxiety, including eating an orange in the shower. “There is no evidence-base for eating citrus in the shower as a means to reducing anxiety, and I would worry that this would lead on to an ever-increasing spiral of unusual behaviours,” said Okai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNNmYzclVabWt1RlAwaFJnQzl0UlJIeUQwMDlHdjAyNXZhdl80Nl95VE9MZkVjcVRRUm9tRkRZalh5cXpjbHdhZ2lTWEdKOWZpRndqZXMzVWZYZUNVVTUtTG1UMWhwX05tbDNzYWhtZ1FrQkxlNzVsM1JTXzl1NzIwZEdQVjJ3Y1ROVEZycDdkLUdTQ1Bsd2tZMjFodVp5YzRMRy0wdk95QmE0UDRUQ1ZtcndBdw</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年5月31日-每日科斯 | Infectious Updates 5/31/2025 - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNVUstcTdVTnZsSGFRSFlBZjI3b2N1UHFNZ1VtQXVZQ0hvWkFUMm1mQkQ0elZrbVI5cHFnRk85MVBjY2s0Zi1wS0tsa1dnWFJuU0dxTlNwUlNldl91bmhIbUdZNHdUZ3E3OVVJSmRXYy1ZNWh6bk9CT0NBb19tc2xrYU5VRlg5R0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has 2515 cases and counting rapidly, more than twice the confirmed measles cases as the US.  Alberta &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/southern-alberta-measles-cases-tip-of-iceberg-1.7546237" target="_blank" title=""&gt;has 654 confirmed,&lt;/a&gt; concentrated in the south, and doctors report that the patients they see are reporting that other family members have had it recently and not gone to a doctor, so the actual total is much worse. In many ways, Alberta is Canada’s Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico was over 1500 cases at last report, but up-to-date figures are hard to come by.  &lt;a href="https://disa.org/measles-outbreak-challenges-mexico-amidst-public-distrust-and-misinformation/" target="_blank"&gt;They are working hard against misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination rates often do not remain high enough, worldwide, and the Covid pandemic disrupted efforts, which have not recovered in any WHO region. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3" target="_blank"&gt;Nature.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In practice, however, vaccination coverage often plateaus or declines after substantial initial gains (Supplementary Fig. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#MOESM1" target="_blank"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), leaving many countries stalled in moderate control regimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#ref-CR4" target="_blank"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As a result, resurgence occurs, for example, in 2018–2019, large outbreaks affected several locations including Ukraine, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted control efforts, and as of 2023 no WHO region has regained its pre-pandemic vaccination coverage levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#ref-CR3" target="_blank"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Consequently, 36 countries experienced large and disruptive outbreaks in 2022, rising to 57 countries in 2023 (ref.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#ref-CR5" target="_blank"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/norovirus/norovirus-vaccine-produces-mucosal-immunity-phase-2b-trial" target="_blank"&gt;working norovirus vaccine may be on the horizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H5N1 continues to simmer, no further shoes have dropped as far as the virus. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cambodia-logs-fourth-fatal-h5n1-avian-flu-case-year" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Cambodia reports its fourth fatal case this year&lt;/a&gt;. China had a human case that recovered.  The US is up to 1072 dairy herds affected, and a few more poultry farms added this week. Workers are not being routinely tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna?utm_id=75768454&amp;amp;orgid=&amp;amp;uniquet=&amp;amp;utm_att1=" target="_blank"&gt;The Tfump admin has cancelled Moderna's contract to develop a vaccine.&lt;/a&gt;  They really want us to die, don't they? RFKJr wants to &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/rfk-jr-says-no-covid-vaccines-healthy-children-pregnant-women" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Deny Covid vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, despite pregnancy being a high-risk condition for severe disease.  And he wants Moderna and Pfizer to put on their labels that myocarditis is a "common" adverse event which it %$#@ing well isn't.  Disinformation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/yellow-fever/quick-takes-yellow-fever-risk-h5n1-avian-flu-case-china-updated-moderna-covid-vaccine" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Yellow fever risk is high in the Americas&lt;/a&gt;, including outside the Amazon basin.&lt;/p&gt;

He was unusually lethargic and struggled with breathing. Blood tests revealed dangerously high levels of ammonia, and further testing confirmed a deficiency in the CPS1 enzyme — an extremely rare genetic disorder where one in two patients dies within the first few months of life. Those who survive often experience developmental delays and intellectual disabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="cdjrf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cdjrf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cdjrf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Once diagnosed, KJ’s doctors immediately began a race to develop a personalized gene therapy to correct the specific error in his genetic code. Remarkably, they succeeded in just six months, making young Muldoon the first person ever to receive a gene-editing therapy tailored exclusively for him. This achievement paves the way for personalized gene therapies for rare genetic disorders that are currently deemed untreatable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="celj1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide firstImageInArticle firstImageInArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx" id="image_ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SyGpsGCmWgl/SyGpsGCmWgl_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="Baby KJ is the first person in the world to undergo personalized gene therapy using base editing technology  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SyGpsGCmWgl/SyGpsGCmWgl_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="Baby KJ is the first person in the world to undergo personalized gene therapy using base editing technology  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Baby KJ is the first person in the world to undergo personalized gene therapy using base editing technology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="710s5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="710s5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="710s5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;KJ, the fourth child of Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, was born a few weeks early in Pennsylvania and initially appeared healthy. However, shortly after birth, he began showing symptoms that led doctors to suspect meningitis or sepsis — a severe and life-threatening response to a blood infection. Thanks to the vigilance of his caregivers, dangerously high levels of ammonia were detected in his blood, and the doctors quickly realized that his critical condition was not caused by an infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="c9t0e-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c9t0e-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c9t0e-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The infant was transferred to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where the medical team began treatment to remove the excess ammonia from his body. At the hospital, KJ’s genome was sequenced, revealing a defect in both copies of the gene responsible for producing the CPS1 enzyme. This meant his body could not produce the enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the urea cycle — the body's process of eliminating ammonia, a toxic byproduct of protein breakdown, by converting it into urea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="7l32m-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7l32m-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7l32m-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In healthy individuals, ammonia is converted into urea in the liver, enters the bloodstream and is then filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. But for those lacking a functioning CPS1 enzyme, ammonia accumulates in the body to toxic levels. This condition is life-threatening because ammonia is especially harmful to nerve cells and can cause brain damage, coma and death. It is also an extremely rare condition, affecting only one in every 1.3 million newborns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a566k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a566k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a566k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Treatment for CPS1 deficiency typically involves reducing protein intake in the patient’s diet and administering medications that help eliminate ammonia — until the child is old enough for a liver transplant with a functioning urea cycle. However, during this time, spikes in ammonia levels — such as those triggered by infections — can lead to irreversible brain damage or death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a30np-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a30np-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a30np-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“When we Googled CPS1 deficiency, we saw there were two likely outcomes – a liver transplant or death,” said Nicole, KJ’s mother. “We were in shock.” Faced with this devastating reality, she and her partner decided to keep KJ hospitalized for as long as necessary, so he could receive round-the-clock care to maximize his chances of survival. Due to his critical condition, KJ was placed on the liver transplant waiting list at just five months old — a transplant that might arrive too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="2rlr9-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="66s6i-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="66s6i-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="66s6i-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Meanwhile, KJ’s medical team began working on a potential treatment that might be able to repair one of the defective copies of his gene in the liver. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a physician and researcher at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Kiran Musunuru, a doctor and geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, along with their colleagues, described the race to develop the gene therapy in a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="bmo9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bmo9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bmo9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru have been collaborating for several years in an effort to find ways to correct genetic errors — mutations — in the livers of children suffering from urea cycle disorders. Their focus was on base editing, a CRISPR-based gene-editing enables the alteration of a single base, or “letter”, in DNA. The CRISPR system, which scientists began using only in the past decade, has revolutionized genetic engineering. It enables easy and rapid gene editing and is often described as "genetic scissors" that cut both strands of the DNA. In contrast, base editing is more like using an eraser and pencil — it makes a small nick in one DNA strand, enabling the replacement of a single base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="c35i8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c35i8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c35i8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;To help children born with urea cycle disorders, mutations must be corrected as early as possible, before irreversible damage occurs. To that end, Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru developed a workflow to accelerate the production of a personalized base-editing system from the moment a patient’s disease-causing mutation is identified. The researchers had practiced the process, selecting a known genetic error that causes a urea cycle disorder and working as fast as possible to develop a suitable editor. In each trial, they managed to reduce the time required to find a solution — from over a year to just a few months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="5260b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5260b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5260b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;KJ’s mutation was the seventh they attempted to rapidly correct — but this time, it wasn’t just a lab exercise.

They worked almost nonstop, including through holidays. By the time KJ was one month old, the researchers had already grown cell cultures carrying his specific mutation to test the treatment. A month later, they had a working base-editing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="96atv-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll" id="image_ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/Syc2Oz511ll/Syc2Oz511ll_0_0_3000_1800_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="CRISPR  (Illustration: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/Syc2Oz511ll/Syc2Oz511ll_0_0_3000_1800_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="CRISPR  (Illustration: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;CRISPR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Illustration: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="67thd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="67thd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="67thd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The system is encased in a tiny fatty bubble (lipid nanoparticle) that protects it and helps it enter liver cells. Inside the bubble are the instructions for producing the editor, along with a small genetic sequence (gRNA) that guides the editor precisely to the location where the incorrect letter in one copy of KJ’s gene needs to be corrected. This sequence was named “kayjayguran” after the baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="chrra-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="chrra-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="chrra-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines use similar lipid bubbles, though they don’t carry instructions to alter genetic sequences.

The treatment successfully corrected the mutation. However, as it often happens with the CRISPR system, it also caused some unintended changes in other regions of the DNA. Fortunately, testing showed that these off-target genetic changes did not cause harm. It is similar in a way to correcting a typo in the sentence “Cats have many supestitions,” so it reads “Kats have many superstitions” after the correction. The change outside the word “superstitions” doesn’t alter the meaning of the sentence and, therefore, is harmless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a8mo8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a8mo8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a8mo8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;At the same time, the researchers were also testing the therapy’s safety in a macaque monkey. When KJ was six months old, the researchers submitted the test results and an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of the therapy as an investigational new drug for a single patient. The FDA approved the request within a week, and several biotech companies collaborated to produce the treatment at cost and at a quality suitable for human use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="2oqmd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2oqmd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2oqmd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Once the researchers knew they had an approved treatment, Ahrens-Nicklas finally told KJ’s parents that she might have good news. “My biggest fear in all of this was giving false hope to a family,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6ad7s-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe" id="image_ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/S1g53uMcZgx/S1g53uMcZgx_0_0_1000_667_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="Illustration: Shutterstock" aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/S1g53uMcZgx/S1g53uMcZgx_0_0_1000_667_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="Illustration: Shutterstock" aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Illustration: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="55ncq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="55ncq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="55ncq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Nicole and Kyle chose to go ahead with the treatment. “Our child was sick. We either had to have a liver transplant or give him this medicine that’s never been given to anybody before,” Kyle said. “It was an impossible choice, but we felt this was the best possible scenario for a life that, at one point, we didn’t know if he would be able to have.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="frrf2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="frrf2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="frrf2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;On February 25, six-month-old KJ received his first infusion — the first of three approved doses — at a very low dose. In March and late April, he received two more infusions at higher doses. His condition improved almost immediately: he was able to eat more protein, his medication dose was cut in half and even viral infections didn’t cause spikes in his blood ammonia levels — a typical reaction for patients like him. He also gained weight, jumping from the 7th percentile just before the first infusion to the 40th percentile now, at 9.5 months old. In addition, KJ is currently no longer on the liver transplant list, although it’s still uncertain if he might need one in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="b6977-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b6977-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b6977-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The treatment did not cure him, but it significantly reduced the severity of his disease. “While KJ will need to be monitored carefully for the rest of his life, our initial findings are quite promising,” Ahrens-Nicklas said in a press release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="4gpp9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4gpp9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4gpp9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Only a few weeks have passed since his last infusion, and it’s still too early to determine whether KJ’s improvement will be sustained over time, whether there will be any long-term side effects, or whether he will eventually be able to stop taking ammonia-clearing medications. Additionally, there is no way to determine the exact success rate of the gene editing in KJ’s liver or whether any unintended genetic changes occurred. To assess this, researchers would need to perform a liver biopsy, which is too risky for a baby of his age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6m4i2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6m4i2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6m4i2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Still, thanks to the treatment and his dramatic improvement, KJ no longer requires full-time hospitalization and will soon be going home. “We’re so excited that we’ll finally all be together at home,” said Kyle. “So that KJ can be with his siblings — and we can finally breathe again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6gmi9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6gmi9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6gmi9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The treatment KJ received is specifically tailored for him, designed to address the single mutation in his CPS1 gene. It cannot help other patients with the same enzyme deficiency if their disease is caused by a different mutation in the gene. However, its success offers hope that this method can be adapted for the rapid development of personalized gene therapies for patients with rare diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="cc63l-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee" id="image_ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SylajfCmZel/SylajfCmZel_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="KJ and Kyle Muldoon  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SylajfCmZel/SylajfCmZel_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="KJ and Kyle Muldoon  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;KJ and Kyle Muldoon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="f9ntd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f9ntd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f9ntd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Estimates suggest there are over 10,000 rare diseases. While each one is individually rare, together they affect about 300 million people worldwide as of 2024. More than 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and the majority affect children. A very large portion of these diseases currently lacks treatment, partly because it has not been financially viable for companies to invest the time and resources required to develop drugs for such small patient populations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="20a50-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="20a50-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="20a50-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The hope of KJ’s medical team — and of other groups working on similar therapies — is that most components of the gene therapy could remain the same, while certain elements, like the small genetic sequence that directs the editor to its target, could be personalized for each patient. This approach could potentially bypass some regulatory steps currently required for treatment approval, further shortening development time and reducing costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="d7591-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d7591-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d7591-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;How much does it cost to develop such a treatment? It's hard to say. The development budget for KJ’s therapy was part of a larger NIH-funded research project. Musunuru told MIT Technology Review that the development effort involved more than 45 physicians and scientists, along with pro bono assistance from several biotechnology companies. He estimates the eventual cost of gene-editing treatments might be similar to that of liver transplants — around $800,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="abl2o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="abl2o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="abl2o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The development of KJ’s treatment was also made possible by the openness of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which is responsible for regulating such therapies. In an editorial published alongside the article by Ahrens-Nicklas, Musunuru and their colleagues, the center’s director, Peter Marks, wrote that he had adopted “an advanced regulatory approach aimed at safely accelerating the development and availability of life-saving drugs.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a6ipq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a6ipq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a6ipq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;However, in March of this year, Marks was forced to resign after attempting to defend the FDA against actions taken by U.S. Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is now unclear whether the center will continue to support personalized gene therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="p43f-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="p43f-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="p43f-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The administration’s cuts to research funding and the NIH budget also raise concerns about the future of gene therapies in particular, and the future of scientific research in the U.S. more broadly. KJ’s treatment would not have been possible without federal investment — both in the treatment itself and in the many years of research that preceded it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="df7ao-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="df7ao-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="df7ao-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The CRISPR system was discovered through basic research— federally funded — on the immune system of bacteria against viruses. The development of CRISPR into a gene-editing tool was also largely supported by public investment.

But you can’t cut them out completely. A lot of foods contain sulphur, and it’s a nutrient you need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Foods high in sulphur include some pretty common staples, such as garlic and onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Others include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list_list__njBdr"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cruciferous vegetables, for example broccoli, cauliflower, sprouts and kale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dried fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red meat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;To aid with this, WebMD recommend drinking lots of water, adding probiotics to your diet or trying green, ginger, peppermint or chamomile tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk - which manufacturers the drug - told LADbible: "Wegovy (semaglutide injection) and Ozempic (semaglutide injection) are prescription only medicines and require a healthcare professional to prescribe under strict supervision.

We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 RA medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety. As part of this work we continue to monitor reports of adverse drug reactions through routine pharmacovigilance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Regarding safety, the most common adverse events among people treated with Ozempic (semaglutide injection) for its indicated use, are gastrointestinal events including nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.

This practice has been linked to better management of blood sugar, especially for those living with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These recommendations gained fresh attention from Dr. Ifabunmi Oduyemi Osonuga at &lt;a href="https://web.oouagoiwoye.edu.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Olabisi Onabanjo University&lt;/a&gt;, Nigeria. His work looked at how increasing water intake might influence glucose parameters and other metabolic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-insulin-resistance"&gt;Understanding insulin resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance happens when the body does not respond well to &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/medication/insulin-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone responsible for helping cells absorb sugar from the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor response to insulin can lead to elevated blood glucose levels and complications tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have mentioned that good hydration may help with insulin action by lowering the concentration of certain hormones that affect sugar metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body has less fluid, it can produce &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526069/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vasopressin&lt;/a&gt;, which research shows can negatively impact glucose regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-impact-of-water-on-blood-glucose"&gt;The impact of water on blood glucose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts note that dehydration could raise the risk of higher blood sugar. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5197923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found glucose concentrations dropped notably in non-diabetic individuals after a set period of increased water intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved hydration supports kidney function so the body can eliminate extra sugar more effectively. This process may aid those dealing with insulin resistance who are looking to optimize glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-daily-water-consumption"&gt;Tips for daily water consumption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions from the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10925/chapter/6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; say adult men should aim for about 3.7 liters of fluid daily from all sources, while adult women should aim for about 2.7 liters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least half of that total should come from pure water, which means focusing on beverages without added sugars or artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often advise drinking water before meals to help reduce unnecessary calories. Those with insulin resistance might benefit from planning their water intake throughout the day to maintain steady hydration levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-when-you-don-t-drink-enough"&gt;What happens when you don’t drink enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mars-water-reservoir-discovered-medusae-fossae-formation-two-miles-deep/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; too often may trigger a hormonal response that works against blood sugar balance. When the body senses dehydration, it produces more vasopressin, a hormone that helps the kidneys retain water but also influences how sugar is processed in the liver and pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher vasopressin levels are linked to increased blood sugar and poorer insulin response. This makes dehydration a quiet contributor to glucose spikes, especially in people who are already managing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-advantages-for-appetite-control"&gt;Possible advantages for appetite control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have noted that drinking water can help curb hunger by preventing confusion between thirst and hunger signals. Taking a glass of water soon after waking and regularly over the course of the day can help reduce overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice seems especially relevant for anyone managing insulin resistance, where weight regulation is key. Even small habits like consistent water intake may add up over time when paired with a balanced diet and regular activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connecting-hydration-with-kidney-health"&gt;Connecting hydration with kidney health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kidneys play a vital role in clearing excess glucose from the blood. When a person is well hydrated, the kidneys filter more efficiently, helping to excrete extra sugar through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unidentified-chemical-found-in-tap-water-across-the-u-s/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, this system slows down. That can lead to higher concentrations of glucose in the blood, placing extra strain on the body and increasing the risk of complications in individuals with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hydration-ties-into-lifestyle-changes"&gt;How hydration ties into lifestyle changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists emphasize that hydration alone cannot reverse insulin resistance. They see it as one piece of a bigger plan that includes balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and medical monitoring as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A supportive lifestyle often yields gradual improvements in insulin sensitivity. Good hydration, healthier food choices, and consistent physical movement can work together to keep blood sugar levels more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-more-research-is-heading"&gt;Where more research is heading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence that short-duration exposure to plain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; intake can improve glycemic parameters in diabetic patients is limited,” remarked Dr. Osonuga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators have observed that short-term trials linking plain water intake to better glycemic measures show promise, especially in individuals who do not yet have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer and broader studies are planned to explore whether these improvements translate to lasting changes in people already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope this approach might guide personalized water-consumption advice for different groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-reminders"&gt;Practical reminders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians suggest checking the color of one’s urine as a quick gauge of hydration, aiming for a light yellow shade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals should consider other health factors, such as kidney conditions or cardiovascular issues, before making drastic changes to fluid intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who struggle with daily water consumption might try flavor-infused water using slices of fruit for variety without adding sugary ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may prefer consistent sipping throughout the day to stay hydrated without feeling overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-on-hydration-habits"&gt;Final thoughts on hydration habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with diabetes need strategies to keep their blood sugar in a healthier range. Drinking eight to 10 glasses of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-discovery-water-molecules-will-force-chemistry-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; daily could be a helpful step, but it is only one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the whole lifestyle picture offers the best results. With careful planning, consistent monitoring, and professional advice, water intake may play a meaningful role in supporting balanced glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227624000590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific African&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 16:04:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQc1pfRHhURXB2YTFJMlI5OUpPV2k2SHZxUUFzcm81bjlWN0hqRHhyTTI2UnRIRHdJcHRjbjF1TlBhNFNtY1ZUT0FIRlh2U3I0djVSNzZ3QXc4c3FiUDZOUGNRZTVhd2RDS1JsMTJEdkJfTHVQV3hRNzc4VTA3c2dHblRMc1dDRGJPUnI4QkxycUdhWkRjeWhITEk2RjkzOWlXVWw5SVpRQVdJVE5QTDE4RUFYTnRoMXdMakdZZjVOTQ</guid></item><item><title>另一位健美运动员刚刚死于可怕的死亡- futurism.com | Another Bodybuilder Just Died a Horrible Death - futurism.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE40cVBId1pmNkhQOGVxY09weW9PcmE5Wmp5M3hTMGZLSVdvSWRNWWRUWUtuV2tIaWhfbUdseVR5ekd4bElkdmJfd093OVp3M2pvbTNFeUtmaGw4VkczUlRoZ2J4MlNLdXh6VWtMSXVYVEx3S0ZDZlVUeg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by @tkachyk_1990 via Instagram / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After quitting the bizarre injections that puffed up his muscles, a Russian bodybuilder has become the latest in a long and unfortunate line of pro weightlifters to meet untimely demises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/35073298/bodybuilding-star-nikita-tkachuk-dead-muscle-growth-injections/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, 35-year-old Nikita Tkachuk hadn't injected synthol — a so-called "&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-synthol-and-why-are-bodybuilders-injecting-it-into-their-muscles-237528" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;site enhancement oil&lt;/a&gt;" primarily made up of oils like paraffin or sesame alongside a local anesthetic and benzoyl alcohol that makes muscles appear bulkier without actually causing any strength or fitness benefits — before he died of a heart attack in a St. Petersburg hospital last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how he got there is tragic, even for the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/fitness-influencer-death" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;morbid world of weightlifting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After winning "Master of Sports" in Russia at 21, Tkachuk began injecting synthol to appear beefier. That practice is known as "&lt;a href="https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/575932/2/Synthol_Hall_Grogan_Gough.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;fluffing&lt;/a&gt;," and it produces muscles that appear, as &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; magazine put it back in 2013, "&lt;a href="https://www.ironmanmagazine.com/inject-to-grow/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;comically inflated&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Tkachuk signed a deal with a pharmaceutical company that contractually obligated him to keep taking the shots — a deal that turned out to be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initially being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a disorder involving tiny granules of immune cells forming on his organs, the strain from all that "fluffing" ultimately led to kidney and lung failure, and then a heart attack, his widow, Maria Tkachuk, said, per &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were many trials over the years," said the widow Tkachuk, who is also a bodybuilder. "[His] resources ran out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a lot remains unclear about the man's death, including why he finally succumbed years after quitting the injections, his regret over the use of synthol — which in a 2022 video he called his "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10xuvEOBWSc" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;biggest mistake&lt;/a&gt;" — is plain as day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If your arm is 18 inches or 20 inches, what will it change in your life?" Tkachuk said ahead of his death, per &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. "You're going to lose a lot of health.

The oils are extracted from the seeds of plants, like canola oil from canola — or rapeseed — plant seeds. The other seed oils of concern are corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, sunflower, safflower and rice bran oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seed oils are primarily polyunsaturated fats, which are less chemically stable than saturated fats, the main lipid in animal fats.

That’s a problem, they say, because it’s hydrofluorosilicic acid, &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/halogen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a chemical byproduct;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a chemical byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the phosphate fertilizer industry, and contains heavy metals &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/arsenic-cadmium-rice-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as arsenic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;such as arsenic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s true that hydrofluorosilicic acid is the fluoridation &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/institutes/foia/58947-tranche-6.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:agent of choice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;agent of choice&lt;/a&gt; for many municipalities . That hydrofluorosilicic acid also contains more arsenic than sodium fluoride is also true, &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2013-19486/p-32" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the EPA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, which has also said it limits the amount of arsenic allowed in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Toxic Nation” sources added that fluoride can block thyroid receptors and cause dental fluorosis. This is a cosmetic change in children’s tooth enamel caused by ingesting excessive fluoride while their permanent teeth are still forming underneath their gums, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/about-dental-fluorosis.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background: &lt;/strong&gt;Medical organizations or institutions such as the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faq/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; continue to support water fluoridation and use of fluoride toothpaste. Most of the documentary sources acknowledged that sodium fluoride can strengthen enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies prove that “water fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing dental decay by at least 25% in children and adults, even in the of era widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, such as fluoride toothpaste,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A new study &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/fluoride-removal-excess-cavities-study?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the journal JAMA affirms this. It estimated that eliminating fluoride from public water systems would be associated with a 7.5% increase in tooth decay, according to data on 8,484 children with an average age of 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a few studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a few studies&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/publications/monographs/mgraph08" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a federal review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a federal review&lt;/a&gt; published in August, have supported concerns about higher levels of fluoride in water affecting children’s intellectual development. Some have also found only slight dental benefits of fluoridating water. But the federal review noted that associations between normal levels of fluoride and children’s IQ are less consistent. And research on adults is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to avoid fluoride intake, you can buy water filters that filter out fluoride. They should be independently certified, such as by the National Sanitation Foundation or another official lab. Also ensure your kids don’t swallow toothpaste that contains fluoride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To help prevent cavities, brush and floss your teeth daily and nightly, and limit your intake of sugary foods and beverages, the &lt;a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/dental-care/how-do-we-prevent-cavities" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; recommends.

            Ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, pesticides and fluoride: They’re all targets of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, whose chief proponent is US Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;Robert F.

            Now, MAHA Films, a production company dedicated to promoting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/rfk-trump-health-influencers"&gt;the movement’s values&lt;/a&gt;, has released its first documentary.

            “Toxic Nation: From Fluoride to Seed Oils — How We Got Here, Who Profits, and What You Can Do” highlights those four food- and environmental-related issues that Kennedy’s nonprofit MAHA Action, an advocacy partner for the film, says “silently endanger millions of Americans every day.” &lt;a href="https://rka9exdbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001tZooA0RZeZZd3ESBpK13tT9Et8brE4sosAMhAVJaoASRw6Iu4gu-4XfiwelvYFk8TaHGOVcGJ_qY5F2orDzNws11WxZKryJK_BPzTnds1jaqLj1xoUDTlNuDzyPPuM_9Q4rdQ4rAkZAhtebEUn3UcA==&amp;amp;c=PEXIr4Ve566P7F1V4Zm8K1slXbvRa6aL9rC-9oJbJ8T7fWoMVNFpWg==&amp;amp;ch=fCWt771tjNapjpiFfA66ZZ50-Ju5XUsJxO8uSLFjsbH1ddwuiX0LXg==" target="_blank"&gt;Released online Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the film is the first in a planned four-part series.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            “If we can love our children more than we hate each other, we can solve the chronic disease epidemic affecting them,” producer and director Jeff Hays said in a news release, &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/e22JSr2g7mo?si=lPY3kHcJr8zdXPnC" target="_blank"&gt;quoting Kennedy’s ethos&lt;/a&gt;. “‘Toxic Nation’ is our love letter to that vision, a call to create an America where families can finally thrive in true health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The documentary’s release follows the May 22 publication of the first MAHA Commission report, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/maha-rfk-report-medicines-processed-foods-pesticides"&gt;lays the groundwork&lt;/a&gt; for an overhaul of federal policy to reduce the burden of chronic disease on American children. Still, Kennedy’s agenda to overhaul food systems, pharmaceuticals and environmental toxins may run into roadblocks due to significant budget and staffing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts"&gt;cuts at HHS&lt;/a&gt; and the US Environmental Protection Agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The Trump Administration can’t have it both ways,” Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization, wrote in an email. (Although there is substantial overlap with some issues that have become Kennedy’s focus at HHS, the documentary was not released by the federal government.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “On the one hand, they’re sounding the alarm about diet-related disease and the illnesses caused by dangerous chemicals,” Faber added. “On the other hand, they’re making it &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/01/health/staff-cuts-at-federal-health-agencies-have-begun"&gt;harder for people&lt;/a&gt; to build healthy diets and eliminating the safeguards that protect us from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/forever-chemicals-epa-regulation"&gt;toxins like PFAS&lt;/a&gt; and pathogens.”

            Although some experts have long talked about the effects of what we consume on our risk of disease, when it comes to specifics, there is some controversy around the potential dangers, benefits or neutrality, if any.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The documentary calls out ultraprocessed foods as one of the roots of chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000h3b6mr9vh5j8w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Composing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/ultraprocessed-hyperpalatable-foods-wellness"&gt;up to 70%&lt;/a&gt; of the US food supply, ultraprocessed foods are made with industrial techniques and ingredients “never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca5644en/ca5644en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Ultraprocessed foods are typically low in fiber; are high in calories, added sugar, refined grains and fats, and sodium; and include additives such as preservatives, flavor enhancers &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness"&gt;or dyes&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The research:&lt;/strong&gt; Numerous studies over decades have linked consumption of ultraprocessed foods to diseases or health issues &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/ultraprocessed-food-additives-harm-wellness"&gt;including type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, premature death, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/31/health/ultraprocessed-foods-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, depression, cognitive decline, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and sleep disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The harms could be partly due to ultraprocessed foods’ effects on metabolism, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/health/high-cholesterol-triglycerides-alzheimers-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;experts have said&lt;/a&gt; — since without fiber, for example, refined carbohydrates can raise triglycerides and spike blood glucose levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;QUIZ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/11/health/ultraprocessed-foods-health-wellness/"&gt;How much ultraprocessed food are you eating?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: Limit your intake of ultraprocessed foods by increasing your consumption of whole fruits, veggies, grains, nuts and seeds, and legumes. Read ingredient labels and be aware of how much sodium you’re eating and how certain foods make you feel; ultraprocessed foods can keep you wanting more, whereas whole foods are more satiating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The documentary challenges the long-held guidance that for heart health, cooks should replace saturated fats from animal products such as beef tallow, pig lard and butter with seed oils. (Kennedy applauded &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/beef-tallow-healthy-seed-oils-rfk-wellness"&gt;Steak ‘n Shake’s switchover&lt;/a&gt; from seed oils to beef tallow for frying its french fries, calling it a healthier choice.)

            &lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Vegetable and seed oils became popular in the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, when scientists began looking into animal fat as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the culprit behind the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html"&gt;uptick in cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; and promoted oils as heart-healthy alternatives.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some experts’ concerns about seed oils are based on their chemistry, the industrial production involving various chemicals and the behavior of seed oils when they’re exposed to heat, air and light. The oils are extracted from the seeds of plants, like canola oil from canola — or rapeseed — plant seeds. The other seed oils of concern are corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, sunflower, safflower and rice bran oils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000r3b6mw18qcbkr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are primarily polyunsaturated fats, which are less chemically stable than saturated fats, the main lipid in animal fats. Polyunsaturated fats are thus prone &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4066722/" target="_blank"&gt;to faster peroxidation&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to oxygen or cooked, which can produce molecules linked to cellular damage and oxidative stress, Dr. Daisy Zamora, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Medicine, told CNN in March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The research:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past few decades and continuing today, scientists have published copious data showing that diets &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/butter-seed-oils-reduced-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;higher in plant fats&lt;/a&gt; result in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/health/fat-stroke-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;better health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; than diets higher in animal fats, Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, the Stanley N. Gershoff Professor of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston, told CNN in March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000t3b6m7ch1byu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research on seed oils has picked up over the past decade , including Zamora’s &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/abstract/2013/11000/targeted_alteration_of_dietary_n_3_and_n_6_fatty.27.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; that found limiting seed oils improved &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" target="_blank"&gt;participants’ chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies have linked seed oil intake with atherosclerosis or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5422895/#Sec18" target="_blank"&gt;biomarkers of fat&lt;/a&gt; buildup in arteries. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            The risk of harmful degradation products may not come into play unless the oils are cooked too hot, used repeatedly or kept for too long, and it’s possible that some food companies, restaurants and individuals may be doing those things, Dr. Eric Decker, a professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told CNN in a previous story.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re concerned about seed oils, you can try substituting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/health/olive-oil-healthiest-quality-wellness"&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; or avocado oil, experts said. Experts also recommend that any fat you consume should be in moderation.

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The film raises concerns about the herbicide glyphosate, citing previously documented links to cancer. Sources also said glyphosate may &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/health/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-wellness"&gt;cause endocrine disruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/health/microbiome-health-wellness"&gt;damaged gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter potentially increasing risk for irritable bowel diseases and celiac disease.

            &lt;strong&gt;The research:&lt;/strong&gt; Research on the effects of glyphosate on the human gut microbiome is in the early stages, although harm in rats has been found. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/health/us-glyphosate-cancer-study-scli-intl"&gt;A 2019 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of studies on thousands of people and animals found that exposure to glyphosate was associated with a 41% higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system.

            The US Food and Drug Administration’s role is to ensure that pesticide or herbicide residues on or in domestic and imported foods don’t exceed limits set by the EPA, at levels the EPA determines to “provide a reasonable certainty of no harm,” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/pesticides/questions-and-answers-glyphosate" target="_blank"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;.

            The &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-releases-draft-risk-assessments-glyphosate" target="_blank"&gt;EPA has said&lt;/a&gt; that glyphosate isn’t likely to be carcinogenic for humans and that it &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/health/epa-says-glyphosate-is-safe"&gt;continues to find&lt;/a&gt; “no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label.”

            The EPA’s conclusion contradicts the &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization’s stance&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/who-iarc-glyphosate/" target="_blank"&gt;has been controversial&lt;/a&gt;   among both industry and some health experts. The decision was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/us/roundup-cancer-verdict-philadelphia-bayer-monsanto"&gt;thousands of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; — against the leading producer of glyphosate-based weed killers — claiming that glyphosate exposure caused plaintiffs’ cancer. Some have been successful to varying degrees, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/10/health/monsanto-johnson-trial-verdict"&gt;high-profile case&lt;/a&gt; partly argued by Kennedy when he was an environmental lawyer.

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do:&lt;/strong&gt; You can limit your consumption of herbicides (as well as pesticides) by eating mostly or only organic foods. Since that’s not feasible for many people, you can still make an impact by reducing your intake of the foods on the Environmental Working Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php" target="_blank"&gt;“Dirty Dozen” list&lt;/a&gt; and increasing your intake of &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/2024foodnews/clean-fifteen.php" target="_blank"&gt;its “Clean Fifteen”&lt;/a&gt; foods. The lists refer to conventionally grown fruits and vegetables with the most or least amount of pesticide residues, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Still, the &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/faq.php" target="_blank"&gt;EWG also says&lt;/a&gt; the health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure, so don’t let perfection be the enemy of the good.

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim: &lt;/strong&gt;Documentary sources claimed that the type of fluoride predominantly used in drinking water for most of the US population differs from dental sodium fluoride. That’s a problem, they say, because it’s hydrofluorosilicic acid, &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/halogen" target="_blank"&gt;a chemical byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the phosphate fertilizer industry, and contains heavy metals &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/arsenic-cadmium-rice-wellness"&gt;such as arsenic&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It’s true that hydrofluorosilicic acid is the fluoridation &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/institutes/foia/58947-tranche-6.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agent of choice&lt;/a&gt; for many municipalities . That hydrofluorosilicic acid also contains more arsenic than sodium fluoride is also true, &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2013-19486/p-32" target="_blank"&gt;according to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, which has also said it limits the amount of arsenic allowed in water.

            “Toxic Nation” sources&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;added that fluoride can block thyroid receptors and cause dental fluorosis. This is a cosmetic change in children’s tooth enamel caused by ingesting excessive fluoride while their permanent teeth are still forming underneath their gums, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/about-dental-fluorosis.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Most of the documentary sources acknowledged that sodium fluoride can strengthen enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The research: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies prove that “water fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing dental decay by at least 25% in children and adults, even in the of era widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, such as fluoride toothpaste,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" target="_blank"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            A new study &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/fluoride-removal-excess-cavities-study"&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the journal JAMA affirms this. It estimated that eliminating fluoride from public water systems would be associated with a 7.5% increase in tooth decay, according to data on 8,484 children with an average age of 9.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science"&gt;a few studies&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/publications/monographs/mgraph08" target="_blank"&gt;a federal review&lt;/a&gt; published in August, have supported concerns about higher levels of fluoride in water affecting children’s intellectual development. Some have also found only slight dental benefits of fluoridating water. But the federal review noted that associations between normal levels of fluoride and children’s IQ are less consistent. And research on adults is scarce.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to avoid fluoride intake, you can buy water filters that filter out fluoride. They should be independently certified, such as by the National Sanitation Foundation or another official lab. Also ensure your kids don’t swallow toothpaste that contains fluoride.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            To help prevent cavities, brush and floss your teeth daily and nightly, and limit your intake of sugary foods and beverages, the &lt;a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/dental-care/how-do-we-prevent-cavities" target="_blank"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; recommends.

    &lt;p&gt;Last week, the World Health Organization designated NB.1.8.1, a new strain of COVID-19 that’s been rising in frequency lately, as a “variant under monitoring.” Now, Washington state has its first case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was detected by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance program at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to a statement sent to McClatchy by the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There appears to be a single detection of NB.1.8.1 in Washington state,” the statement said. “The sample was collected on May 15th 2025 by Ginko Bioworks, the industry partner for CDC’s Traveler Genomic Surveillance Program. This means this sample was captured via a CDC program, not a WA surveillance system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is one of four states where airport screening has detected the new variant, along with California, New York and Virginia. Reports suggest that only a handful of states have detected the variant, which has yet to become common enough for the CDC to include it on its COVID-19 variant tracking dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant has been linked to a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China, leading to concerns it could spread quickly in the U.S. However, officials say the early indications are that the variant doesn’t pose much of a threat. Here’s what to know about NB.1.8.1 in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is NB.1.8.1?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WHO, the frequency of NB.1.8.1 cases quadrupled during April. The variant accounted for 2.5% of COVID-19 samples obtained over the week ending April 6. By April 27, that number had risen to 10.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the sharp rise, health officials say that the case doesn’t necessarily pose a threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WHO, there isn’t much evidence that NB.1.8.1 is any more dangerous than existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The additional public health risk posed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low,” WHO’s latest report on the strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s largely due to the fact that early evidence indicates available COVID vaccines protect against the severe illness in patients with the new variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;NB.1.8.1 risk in WA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO did note that some countries have seen an increase in cases and hospitalizations as NB.1.8.1 spread. However, WHO’s latest update on the variant states that “current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO also noted that little information is available about the variant right now, and that these conclusions are drawn from preliminary observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department echoed WHO, saying that there’s no evidence the variant poses significant risk to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH noted that the case was detected in the airport, making it unclear whether or not the person who tested positive is a Washington resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because this is a Traveler Genomic Surveillance collection, the collection site would be SEA-TAC airport; however, that doesn’t mean that the case is necessarily a Washington resident, meaning county may not be a relevant field,” the DOH statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;COVID-19 cases in WA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 case counts have fallen in Washington so far this year. Through mid-May, the state has seen 399 COVID-19 deaths, according to DOH’s respiratory illness dashboard. That’s less than half of the 897 deaths seen at this point last year, and around 25% of the number seen in 2023. The disease currently accounts for 0.5% of Washington hospital visits, compared to 0.9% last May and 1.5% in May of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In mouse models with a rare mutation that causes dopamine to leak abnormally, KOR blockers reduced this leakage and restored normal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could offer safer treatment alternatives for conditions like ADHD, bipolar disorder, and autism, which are often linked to disrupted dopamine signaling. Importantly, the treatment did not affect animals without the mutation, suggesting targeted therapeutic potential with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking KOR reduces dopamine transporter leakage in mice with the DAT Val559 mutation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Restoration:&lt;/strong&gt; KOR blockers reversed cognitive and compulsive symptoms without affecting healthy animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings offer a potential new pathway for treating multiple dopamine-related brain disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine, a small molecule derived from the amino acid tyrosine, plays a significant role in regulating multiple essential brain functions including movement, mood and motivation as well as multiple cognitive functions including attention and memory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine signaling in the brain is a complex process, with many mechanisms in place to accelerate or slow down dopamine’s effects. When dopamine is released from nerve cells, its efficient removal to limit signaling occurs through the activity of special proteins called “transporters,” ensuring a shorter action of dopamine in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110552"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers believe that further work on KOR blockers may give individuals affected with brain disorders that display these alterations better treatment options than what is currently available today. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptions in dopamine signaling have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, substance use disorder and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for dopamine-related conditions use agents that can either block or enhance dopamine signaling such as stimulants used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder including amphetamines, which can have unwanted side effects or lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of dopamine to regulate brain mechanisms of thought, mood and reward has kept scientists searching for better ways to control its actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a newly published study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from Florida Atlantic University and their collaborators have discovered a potentially safer yet effective treatment for multiple disorders that display altered dopamine signaling. The “key?” A molecule that targets a specific protein called the kappa opioid receptor (KOR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioids are commonly known as powerful painkillers with strong psychoactive effects. They increase dopamine signaling in the brain, producing pleasurable sensations that can encourage repeated use and, over time, lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both endogenous and illicit opioid molecules act on signaling proteins termed receptors. But all opioid receptors are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers targeted KOR, a subtype of opioid receptor that when activated can decrease synaptic dopamine levels by decreasing dopamine release and increasing the availability of synaptic dopamine transporters, thereby halting the dopamine signal. Instead of activating KOR, scientists used a drug that can block it. But wouldn’t this cause addiction by elevating dopamine?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It all depends on whether dopamine levels are elevated or suppressed by the insult that produces the disorder to begin with,” said Randy D. Blakely, Ph.D., senior author,  executive director of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the David J.S. Nicholson Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience, and a professor of biomedical science in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some people, a rare genetic mutation known as DAT Val559 causes the dopamine transporter to ‘run backward,’ leaking dopamine into the synapse rather than sucking it away, turning the transporter from an efficient nano-vacuum cleaner into a nano-leaky faucet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shouldn’t a leaking dopamine into the synapses elevate dopamine in the synapse and lead to addiction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Blakely, unlike the sharp rise in dopamine that triggers euphoria and can lead to addiction, dopamine that dribbles out through a leaky transporter makes it hard for a receptive brain cell to detect the normal rapid rise in dopamine that acts to fine tune our thinking and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DAT Val559 genetic variant has been found in individuals with diagnoses of ADHD, ASD and BPD,” said Blakely. “This led us to ponder whether blocking KORs could reduce the expression of leaky dopamine transporters and thereby actually normalize dopamine signaling and restore normal cognition and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the study reveal that this is indeed the case. More than a decade ago, Blakely’s team and collaborators demonstrated that mice engineered to express the mutation show altered behaviors that can be aligned with features seen in individuals with cognitive and compulsive disorders and altered psychostimulant responses, interestingly, in a sex-dependent manner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers administered a long-acting KOR blocking drug to these mice, they found that the agent reduced the expression of the mutant transporter on the cell surface where it normally encounters dopamine, preventing dopamine leaks from reaching dopamine receptors and correcting multiple behavioral deficits seen in the mutant mice.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our studies indicate that when there’s an issue with how DAT is expressed, activated or inhibited, the brain can have altered states of dopamine availability, creating the traits that psychiatrists describe as inattention or compulsivity as well as altered patterns of reactivity and emotion,” said Felix P. Mayer, Ph.D., first author and a former post-doctoral researcher in the Blakely lab, who is now a faculty member at the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayer says that by blocking KOR, they have found a way to help fix this issue, at least in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the DAT mutation is rare, our findings might be considered of limited medical significance,” said Blakely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we and others have found that DAT proteins are sensitively regulated by multiple pathways inside cells. Changes in any one of these pathways, as well as changes that regulate how dopamine is released and acts, could cause behavioral disorders that would benefit from KOR blockers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blakely notes however that antagonizing KOR could have opposite effects if dysregulation of dopamine signaling is not the issue underlying the diagnosis. The key will be defining the type of dopamine change that contributes to the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, for the behaviors assessed in the study, animals with normal DAT protein failed to show behavioral changes when exposed to the KOR antagonist at the doses given, suggesting a degree of protection against side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that further work on KOR blockers may give individuals affected with brain disorders that display these alterations better treatment options than what is currently available today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although the DAT Val559 mutation produces sex-dependent behavioral changes, blocking KOR improved the distinct alterations seen in males and females, suggesting that utility of KOR blockers, at least in mice, is not limited by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of genetic variation in proteins that tightly regulate brain dopamine signaling, like DAT Val559, no matter how rare, can still offer insights into more common disease mechanisms,” said Sammanda Ramamoorthy, Ph.D., co-corresponding author on the study and a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-authors are Adele Stewart, Ph.D., FAU Schmidt College of Medicine and Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute; Durairaj Ragu Varman, Ph.D., and Lankupalle D.

DAT Val559, like several other disease-associated variants of DAT, exhibits anomalous DA efflux (ADE) that can be blocked by d-amphetamine and methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are expressed by DA neurons and modulate DA release and clearance, suggesting that targeting KORs might also provide an alternative approach to normalizing DA-signaling disrupted by perturbed DAT function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we demonstrate that KOR stimulation leads to enhanced surface trafficking and phosphorylation of Thr53 in wildtype DAT, effects achieved constitutively by the Val559 mutant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these effects can be rescued by KOR antagonism of DAT Val559 in ex vivo preparations. Importantly, KOR antagonism also corrected in vivo DA release as well as sex-dependent behavioral abnormalities observed in DAT Val559 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given their low abuse liability, our studies with a construct valid model of human DA associated disorders reinforce considerations of KOR antagonism as a pharmacological strategy to treat DA associated brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 15:31:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4zWXBoRjFoZFZ1TkNGRjlLOEpsdDJkdTM2XzktRkNTbTQ4dFJQVGlLQWRSbWtzNXk2ZTl3UEJCTVlFYV8zSmhkeGVBMDZYZzlxam50RnZnUmtzNTNtc3RTc2NwbFhfREc2aFllN0JR</guid></item><item><title>大幅削减削弱了美国公共卫生系统的基础，结束了进步，威胁到更糟糕的未来-美联社新闻 | Deep cuts erode the foundations of US public health system, end progress, threaten worse to come - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZldOSDFzREJjSUtZbnpKbHlQSTRPS3J0cERYbVRqODdUNWV1VWNQa2RLS3l2WkFQNDMteHRxMk9PdUtpVUtMc1hfVUk2SFAtdDY2cERaVzkwLWZfb0F5WW9BS2k2bUJJQWwtODlPT3hMcE9FUzhNcUFBTU5EVnhDZ0QzWlRINFRCRHhkR2c5bDI3REliRXdCdHgtdmY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 15:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZldOSDFzREJjSUtZbnpKbHlQSTRPS3J0cERYbVRqODdUNWV1VWNQa2RLS3l2WkFQNDMteHRxMk9PdUtpVUtMc1hfVUk2SFAtdDY2cERaVzkwLWZfb0F5WW9BS2k2bUJJQWwtODlPT3hMcE9FUzhNcUFBTU5EVnhDZ0QzWlRINFRCRHhkR2c5bDI3REliRXdCdHgtdmY</guid></item><item><title>7种可能破坏你身体的酸奶-吃这个不是那个 | 7 Yogurts That May Wreck Your Body - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE84WGNCU2hRdjFleEZUTGxNODRyamk0M1VMMjlxeXltQkd3TGJMRExsSHItdzhfSHQyZHhmRUVHcXJpWmx6T2J6SDlqaWlFdGxFRmRnMG9jUUFkWTQ1bEJFcEpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Yogurt is one of the best things you can enjoy for your health—rich in protein (especially for Greek yogurt), calcium, and probiotics, yogurt is a delicious and versatile ingredient to enjoy at any time of the day. Not all yogurts are created equal, though. For every limited-ingredient, high-quality option at the store there are several more packed with unnecessary sugars and additives, turning what should be a simple, nutrient-dense food into an ultraprocessed disaster. Here are seven yogurts that could negatively impact your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One 6 oz container of Yoplait Original French Vanilla contains 19 g of sugar, which includes 14 g of added sugar. That’s almost the sugar limit recommended for women by the American Heart Association (25g). Definitely more of a sweet treat than a healthy snack.&lt;/p&gt;

You’d be better off making a smoothie at home with real yogurt and fruit, but this option sadly misses the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another yogurt marketed towards kids, these &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://danimals.com/kids-yogurt-and-smoothies/yogurt-pouch/strawberry/" target="_blank"&gt;Danimals&lt;/a&gt; Strawberry Flavor Pouches contain 11 g of sugar per 99 oz pouch. That’s almost halfway towards the American Heart Association’s recommendation of 25 g of sugar a day for children in just one pouch of yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Yogurt’s Probiotic &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://layogurt.com/yogurts/rich-creamy-lowfat/" target="_blank"&gt;Pumpkin Pie Yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is, according to the company, “kid approved”, but with 29 g of sugar per 170 g container I would be wary about that. You’re better off getting gut-friendly probiotics from yogurts without so much added sugar.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
