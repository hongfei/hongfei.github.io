    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38tqux00aj26oz4x4668v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not surprising that many people fear the dentist. Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00063b6n8lk4gh5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00073b6n4kvi97pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23458883/" target="_blank"&gt;grew a tooth &lt;/a&gt;from human and mouse cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00083b6nx32ub98d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, she led a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39532305/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt00093b6ne7zrtypj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000a3b6n6eksaw8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000b3b6nksdqhjnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000c3b6nphp2ih3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000d3b6nyj8yc13m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000e3b6nrxthzi6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000g3b6n7cdnstyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000h3b6nlyrkjpm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh39e1pm00153b6nipf3rorz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000i3b6nxvf73jgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000j3b6nhcte4hnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000k3b6n7zilp2pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/04/24/pigs-can-regrow-their-adult-teeth-what-if-humans-could-too" target="_blank"&gt;in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000l3b6nuc19zrso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, &lt;a href="https://iscrm.uw.edu/stories/teaming-up-for-living-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;has successfully grown&lt;/a&gt; dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh38wxkt000m3b6n1uyj51tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New guidelines on what to eat and drink if you have chronic (long-term) constipation have been making news in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the British Dietetic Association's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.70133"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; has focused on advice to eat kiwifruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other recommendations have not received so much attention. One, in particular, marks a shift in managing chronic constipation. The guidelines don't advise a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-type-of-fiber-may-have-weight-loss-benefits-similar-to-ozempic"&gt;A Type of Fiber May Have Weight Loss Benefits Similar to Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the guidelines say help (and don't help) to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the guidelines look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 75  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to come up with recommendations for food, drink and supplements for chronic constipation in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical trials varied and so they had to come up with a consensus on the quality of the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that constipation means different things to different people, they used a very broad definition for constipation. This encompassed what patients perceived to be constipation as well as definitions of constipation used in clinical trials. Chronic constipation is generally when someone passes few, hard stools over a period of at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg" alt="kiwi fruit halved" class="wp-image-178895 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/kiwifruits-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178895" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers recommend eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-kiwi-cut-in-half-GAMExm6pQI0"&gt;Стейси Сакс/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers produced 59 recommendations. However, the researchers said most of the recommendations were based on poor-quality evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why kiwifruit? How many a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommended eating two to three kiwifruit a day for at least four weeks to improve constipation. Whether it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000002124"&gt;green kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194146"&gt;gold kiwifruit&lt;/a&gt; the evidence clearly shows they can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how? There are several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre in kiwifruit &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2002.00287.x"&gt;swells a lot&lt;/a&gt; when mixed with water, more so than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394294-4.00005-5"&gt;apple fibre&lt;/a&gt;. This swelling helps make stools more bulky, easing their way through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating the whole fruit including the skin provides more fibre than just eating the flesh but eating the kiwifruit without the skin is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green kiwifruit contains an enzyme called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114513003401"&gt;actinidin&lt;/a&gt; that helps the body digest protein in the stomach and the small intestine. This may help with constipation by making food proteins softer and easier to pass through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit contain a type of crystal called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2017.1327841"&gt;raphides&lt;/a&gt;. These are believed to increase mucus production in the gut, lubricating it and helping passage of the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwifruit may also result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300646m"&gt;reduced species of methane producing bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.655"&gt;linked to constipation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mineral water and magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported on the benefits of drinking mineral water. They suggested drinking 0.5–1.5 litres a day (roughly two to six cups) of mineral water for two to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Mineral water &lt;a href="https://afcd.foodstandards.gov.au/fooddetails.aspx?PFKID=F005696"&gt;often contains magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072052"&gt;acts as a laxative&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, magnesium oxide is often used as a dietary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020421"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt; for chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines confirmed magnesium oxide can help soften the stool and increase stool frequency. The researchers recommended taking 0.5–1. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="178889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; a day for at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this may not be appropriate for everyone. For instance people with kidney disease need to be careful. Magnesium supplements may also interact with other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rye bread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cited &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118570"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; rye bread relieves constipation more than white bread or common laxatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended six to eight slices a day of rye bread for at least three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this just isn't realistic for a lot of people. And as rye contains gluten, this would not be appropriate for people with coeliac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-fibre diet may not be needed after all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one key surprise in the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said there was a lack of strong evidence for generic high-fibre diets for constipation, when people eat at &lt;a href="https://nutritionaustralia.org/resources/fibre-2/"&gt;least 25g&lt;/a&gt; of fibre a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rationale. The researchers could only find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.01.012"&gt;one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; – the gold standard for testing interventions, such as a change in diet – where a high-fibre diet (25–30g/day) was compared with a low-fibre diet (15–20g/day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial showed no benefit for the high-fibre diet in improving constipation. People on the low-fibre diet farted less and were less bloated than people on the high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean fibre doesn't help constipation. There is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13662"&gt;good evidence&lt;/a&gt; for supplementing your diet with more fibre to help chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than focusing on a high-fibre diet for constipation, the guidelines instead recommend taking at least 10g a day of a fibre supplement, such as psyllium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-fibre diet is usually a key part of national dietary guidelines. For example the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends some adults have a dietary fibre intake of at least 28g a day. There are certainly health benefits such as lowered cholesterol and blood sugar levels from eating a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we now know it's not needed to relieve chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we take away from the guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines provide more personalised, evidence-based dietary advice tailored to patient symptoms than previous guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit are considered a safe and effective treatment for chronic constipation. Mineral water, magnesium supplements and rye bread can help too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be worth discussing magnesium supplements with a health professional, especially if there are concerns about kidney disease or you take other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267617/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Many people turn to tried-and-true medications, like minoxidil, the active ingredient in products like Rogaine. Despite a recent connection to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a65130958/are-hair-loss-supplements-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain health risks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain health risks&lt;/a&gt;, many of these solutions are relatively inexpensive and available over-the-counter—a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are exploring a way to make minoxidil more effective for hair loss—and it involves stevia. You’re probably familiar with stevia as a sweetener, and this hair loss hack actually repurposes it. It specifically uses the sweetener stevioside, which is derived from the stevia plant, to help stimulate hair growth. The research on this is still in its infancy, and this particular study was done on mice, not humans. But the findings are impressive enough that they’re already getting plenty of attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital; &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the link between stevia and hair growth? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503575" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For the study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;For the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers combined stevioside with microneedle patches, which use tiny microneedles to help deliver an active ingredient—in this case, minoxidil—into the skin. The researchers tested this in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose their hair and discovered that more of the minoxidil made it into the skin and more hair grew back in the mice that used the patches with stevioside compared to those that just received minoxidil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the stevioside patches caused the mice to regrow hair across 67.5 percent of the treatment area with hair after 35 days. Mice with different treatment options didn’t see as big of an impact, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might stevia help with hair growth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s still being explored, but the researchers have a theory: Stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve better in water and, in theory, that can help more minoxidil get under the skin and into the hair follicles to push for more growth. In essence, the stevioside “acts as a natural absorption enhancer,” explains &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/gary-goldenberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gary Goldenberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Minoxidil has limited skin permeability, which restricts its effectiveness in traditional applications,” he continues. But minoxidil in dissolving microneedles that are enhanced with something like stevioside can bypass your skin’s resistance to support more minoxidil penetration and, hopefully, create more of an impact, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s important to point out that more research is needed. “I do microneedling in combination with minoxidil to improve efficacy in my practice,” says &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ife J. Rodney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ife J. Rodney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, founding director of Eternal Dermatology + Aesthetics. “But we need controlled trials for the efficacy with adding stevioside and also the safety. We don’t know what the potential side effects could look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't put stevia directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have stevia and minoxidil at home, it’s tempting to want to DIY. But Dr. Goldenberg says that’s unlikely to help. “Without the microneedling, applying stevia onto your scalp won't help much,” he says. “Minoxidil would still have the same absorption issue as using it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to see a dermatologist if you’re dealing with hair loss, Rodney says. “Minoxidil is very useful for some types of hair loss and it’s something you can use at home while you wait to get into the dermatologist’s office,” she says. “But there are many different types of hair loss with different causes and treatments. Depending on the cause of your hair loss, minoxidil may not be the specific or only answer.” Some stand-by treatments dermatologists consistently recommend are here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2% Minoxidil Topical Solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This solution contains 2% minoxidil, the only FDA-approved topical ingredient to deal with hair loss. A great first-line treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMLOKHU?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69136978%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$44.97 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$44.97 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who need a little extra power, this foam is enriched with 5% minoxidil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KWR3WBT?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69136978%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$40.10 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$40.10 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ultima 12 LaserComb&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shoes that laser light can reverse hair loss.

    &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five urinary tract infections in a group of patients in Southern California were linked to E. coli from contaminated meat, a four-year study found. And researchers say the problem could be occurring across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found 18% of the more than 2,300 urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the study — published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mBio&lt;/a&gt; journal on Thursday — were linked to E. coli strains found in meat samples from grocery stores in the same area. The meats most commonly found to test positive for E. coli were turkey and chicken, followed by pork and beef, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/uti/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. They disproportionately affect female and elder patients, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem," Lance B. Price, senior study author and professor at the George Washington University, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102657" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up new avenues for prevention, especially for vulnerable communities that bear a disproportionate burden." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs compared to those in wealthier neighborhoods, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the reasons for the strong correlation between poverty rate and foodborne UTIs are unclear, the authors say possible factors include inadequate food safety regulations, poor retail conditions and improper food handling and hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added these findings show why there should be more investments, not less, in research about the social determinants of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your risk of infection should not depend on your ZIP code," Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more strict measures are put in place by meat producers and regulatory agencies, the authors of the study advise consumers exercise caution when handling raw meat to prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preventive steps, such as thorough handwashing, avoiding cross-contamination, and ensuring proper cooking of meat products, are essential to reducing exposure," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve told her there’s been a lot going on at work, but I can’t keep putting her off forever. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

The writer is not in a position to give us answers to any questions, and it’s not really their place to say, “Hey, wife, we haven’t had sex in two weeks. And now randomly I’m asking, why were you douching?” But please, don’t douche.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jat6z001i3b79170rgxka@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;It seems like one of the most straightforward, unhealthy products of capitalism made under the guise of being for women’s reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jav2p001s3b79b90vdhxq@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; In very rare circumstances, there might be a short-term, specific medical use for it. But the douche as a cleanliness product, just for the sake of it, is not good for you. I cannot walk past the word douche without a public service announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re supposed to do that with clean water, and that’s strictly for the purpose of making one’s asshole not shitty during anal sex. So that’s a different kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jayro002c3b796mtsegmc@published"&gt;It’s funny that you bring it up, because my question after reading this was, what’s so traumatic about douching? What if this guy is super knowledgeable about women’s health, and it’s the very fact that she’s doing this? He can’t believe she would do that to her body.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb0l1002m3b79rhdphuox@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;He’s like, “Oh, my God, until two weeks ago, I thought my wife was a mature adult with functional judgment skills, and it turns out now I can’t look at her the same way.” That is a funny scenario. I think it’s more likely that he is grossed out by the fact of her having a body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb21n002w3b79cwkdjobh@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, it seems like that would be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb32800363b79v0y5i9ob@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/dear-prudence-secret-discovery-worst-way.html"&gt;Dear Prudence column&lt;/a&gt;, there was an ideologically body-positive woman, but she was struggling to connect that ideology in practical terms to how she thinks about her own body. And Jenée told her to look at people with bodies similar to yours being people, doing things everybody does, until that feels normalized. I think that might be useful here. Read some subreddits related to women’s health. Just walk right up to the thing that you never really had to realize before, and kind of rub your own face in it a little bit. Hear about some of the gross stuff. Actually, that might completely backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb4vi003g3b79cnokb4ob@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;It can be shocking to actually consider the full extent of your partner’s humanity and existence in a body, but I think it speaks to a rift in intimacy, that you’d be able to have sex with this person and theoretically want to please them and know their body well enough to do that, but then shrink away when you’re presented with another reality of their body. The fact that, for whatever reason, she thought her vagina was not up to snuff in terms of freshness, and somehow, this is going to send him into a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb6mw003q3b79uigiv4qb@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; Women are people. I’ve never heard of anyone losing their capacity to see a woman as erotic because of douching, but I think that’s only because most people our age got told really early on, “Do not douche.” But I’ve had male partners who didn’t want to wait until my period was over to have sex, but had to do it with the lights off and the windows open because if they were visually or olfactorily confronted with the reality that there is menstrual fluid, which has a coppery smell. They would be squicked out and disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jb93q00403b79gq6rzigg@published"&gt;I’ve also had male partners who are completely fascinated by tampons or menstrual cups, not in an erotic way. There’s nothing arousing about it, but it seems to be the same thing as for me when I saw a male partner shave their face the first few times. There’s that curiosity. The way we teach sex education, even in the areas where people get relatively good sex education, leaves young men severely in the dark about how women’s bodies operate. And I do leave space for the fact that giving birth is pretty traumatic for everyone. So I have a lot of empathy for the men who watch their wife give birth and then are like, “I’ve got a lot to work through.” But these everyday experiences are different.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbblt004a3b79nmgkgijx@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;And that aspect of birth is a documented phenomenon. There are a lot of people who have that reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbd9h004k3b79cxy1l9dn@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so that aside, we’re talking about common, everyday occurrences. When you’re ovulating, the completely healthy fluids coming out of your vulva are sometimes milky or cloudy. Menstrual blood, it’s a thing, it smells like copper, it’s part of having a body. Tampons, they go in, they come out, and they sit in the trash. I mean, it’s aggressive to leave a bloody menstrual cup sitting on the side of the sink where everyone’s toothbrushes are. I can understand how that’s a lot for someone. A tampon in the trash can, that’s another story.&lt;br&gt;It shouldn’t be on the woman to have to manage all of these shocked and grossed-out feelings. It’s like, “I’m sorry. I’m basically an animal with very little body hair.” You’ve got to come to terms with that if you want to have sex with women, marry women, and live with women.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbf7f004u3b79lsoo8pld@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that coming to terms with it is actually the process here. You just kind of have to allow yourself to process these feelings and to understand them and just go through it. It has been two weeks for this guy who saw this thing that traumatized him for whatever reason, so it’s early.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2jbgz200543b798dkl7f7p@published"&gt;If he walked in on her doing it, she’s aware of that. So if the problem is that he doesn’t want to tell her, but she keeps asking, you can tell her. She may find it strange, confusing, or offensive, but it is the reason, and this is a thing that is beyond you; you’re not controlling this. You can be honest about it. Maybe then she’ll have suggestions or she’ll be able to kind of hold your hand, even if you don’t quite deserve it, and actually help you through it. Or you’ll be on your own. And you know what? Give it a few more weeks, give it a month, and you’ll get horny one day, and that will probably be enough to overcome this issue. You just might need to metabolize this and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

Stay in that lane. Own that it is. The writer should own that they are having a reaction that is their problem. They want to let their wife know what’s going on. If the wife offers to be supportive, great. But if at any point the writer frames douching as disgusting or any other facet of just living in a body with internal genitalia and reproductive organs, and the wife leaves them, that is the writer’s fault. If it blows back on you because you’re acting like it’s disgusting to be human, then that’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;

The trial demonstrated that this method of ventilation is safe and “paves the way for future studies to see if this technique can help patients with respiratory failure,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study published on Monday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enteral ventilation is not meant to replace mechanical ventilators or ECMO, but rather to serve as a complementary oxygenation route,” said Takanori Takebe, &lt;a href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/t/takanori-takebe?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an expert in organoid medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with appointments at both Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the University of Osaka, in an email to 404 Media. The technique proves a backdoor “to provide partial oxygen support while allowing the lungs to rest,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while this method is safe for humans, it hasn’t been experimentally shown to work on patients experiencing respiratory distress yet. If future trials show that enteral ventilation is also effective, it could potentially help newborns and premature infants who are struggling to establish lung function after birth, aid patients with severe respiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), or be applied in other situations in which temporary oxygen supplementation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In such cases, intestinal oxygen delivery could serve as a ‘bridge’ therapy until normal respiration or full ventilatory support can be established,” Takebe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-b6b4a63f-1a81-4c89-aed6-bf50bf5e5f41.jpeg 996w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;A figure outlining the first enteral ventilation trial in humans.

This initial trial in humans involved 27 healthy male volunteers, who received a liquid called perfluorodecalin through their rectums in an enema-like process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the trial was only intended to determine the safety of the procedure, rather than probe its efficacy in humans, the perfluorodecalin was not oxygenated and none of the volunteers were experiencing any respiratory distress during the course of the study.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results aligned closely with what we had anticipated from our preclinical data,” Takebe said. “We found that intrarectal administration of perfluorodecalin up to 1,000 mL was safe and well tolerated, with only mild and transient gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next phase will involve testing ‘oxygenated’ perfluorodecalin (O₂-PFD) in patients with hypoxemia to evaluate actual oxygen transfer efficacy,” he added. “We are currently planning a Phase II trial in collaboration with clinical partners in Japan and the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takebe and his colleagues were inspired to develop this roundabout route by aquatic species, such as loaches, which absorb oxygen through their intestines to survive in low-oxygen environments. While the idea of rectally administering perfluorodecalin is relatively new, the use of oxygenated liquid for ventilation dates back decades. It even shows up in James Cameron’s 1989 thriller &lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, which includes a real scene of a rat breathing in a tank of liquid perfluorocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique may prove to be an effective means to alleviate respiratory distress in humans, but it’s also inspired its fair share of jokes because, well, it is about butt breath, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, for instance, Takebe’s team &lt;a href="https://www.tmd.ac.jp/english/news/20240916032859/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;received the Ig Nobel Prize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a satirical award that honors “achievements so surprising that they make people laugh, then think,” according to its website. Fellow Ig Nobel awardees include a team that &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/tiny-matters/the-ig-nobel-prize-levitating-frogs-constipated-scorpions-and-other-science-that-makes-you-laugh-then-think.html?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;levitated a frog in midair&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and another that investigated why&lt;a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/news/11-hilariously-bizarre-winners-of-the-ig-nobel-prize?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt; pregnant women aren’t constantly tipping over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Receiving the Ig Nobel Prize was both humorous and humbling,” Takebe said. “It was a reminder that truly unconventional ideas often begin at the boundary between curiosity and skepticism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the prize is lighthearted in tone, I do believe it serves a serious purpose, encouraging the public to stay curious and to appreciate how even seemingly odd scientific questions can lead to meaningful innovations,” he concluded. “What began as a playful concept is now moving closer to a viable medical technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"&gt;&lt;p class="kg-callout-emoji"&gt;🌘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-callout-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/signup/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscribe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to 404 Media to get &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/tag/the-abstract/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong class="italic"&gt;The Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, our newsletter about the most exciting and mind-boggling science news and studies of the week. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) as the enzyme that releases energy stored in our fat. Yet patients born without this protein do not become obese: on the contrary, they lose their adipose tissue, developing lipodystrophy with severe metabolic complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team from the Institute of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases (I2MC, Inserm/Université de Toulouse) has just solved this puzzle by discovering that HSL plays a second, unsuspected role in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nucleus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nucleus&lt;/a&gt; of fat cells. The study is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00433-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fat cells, called adipocytes, do more than just store extra weight. They play a key role in managing the body's energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipocytes accumulate fat in the form of lipid droplets that the body can use when needed—for example, during fasting periods between meals. To do this, the body uses the HSL protein like a kind of switch. When energy is lacking, HSL is activated by hormones such as adrenaline and releases fat to fuel various organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of HSL, one might assume that the energy tap is shut off and that fat would inevitably accumulate. Paradoxically, however, studies in mice and in patients with mutations in the HSL gene show that this does not lead to obesity with excess fat. Quite the opposite happens: the absence of this protein causes a reduction in fat mass, a pathological condition known as lipodystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity and lipodystrophy, though seemingly opposite, share a common point: in both cases, adipocytes malfunction, leading to similar metabolic and cardiovascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To understand this peculiarity, the research team led by Dominique Langin, professor at the University of Toulouse within the I2MC, noticed that HSL was located in an unexpected area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adipocytes, the protein is known to be on the surface of lipid droplets, where it acts as an enzyme breaking down fat. But the study reveals that it is also present in the nucleus of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the nucleus of adipocytes, HSL is able to associate with many other proteins and take part in a program that maintains an optimal amount of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adipose+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt; and keeps adipocytes 'healthy,'" explains Jérémy Dufau, co-author of the study, who defended his doctoral thesis on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study shows that the amount of HSL in the nucleus is finely regulated. Adrenaline, which activates the enzyme on the lipid droplet, also promotes its exit from the nucleus. This is what happens during fasting. In a pathological context, the amount of nuclear HSL is increased in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HSL has been known since the 1960s as a fat-mobilizing enzyme. But we now know that it also plays an essential role in the nucleus of adipocytes, where it helps maintain healthy adipose tissue," concludes Langin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new role explains the lipodystrophy observed in patients lacking HSL and opens avenues for a better understanding of metabolic diseases such as obesity and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery comes at a timely moment. Overweight and obesity affect one in two adults in France. Worldwide, two and a half billion people are affected. Obesity increases the risk of many diseases, including diabetes and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and impairs quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continued research is essential to improve prevention and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patient care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	This is the first confirmed case of locally acquired terrestrial rabies in a feral cat and the 12th case in wildlife in the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt; As News 12 has reported 11 raccoons tested positive for the virus this year.

	Rabies is a viral disease transmitted from infected mammals to humans. Left untreated, it can lead to death. 

	Early symptoms include irritability, headache, fever, and sometimes itching at the site of exposure. Within days, the disease progresses to paralysis, spasms of the throat muscles, convulsions, delirium, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials are working with the USDA, to conduct a Racoon Rabies Control Program which comprises enhanced surveillance of the raccoon population to identify areas where the disease may be present.

	They're also distributing oral rabies vaccine (ORV) baits in the Towns of Babylon, Huntington, Smithtown, and Islip to prevent the spread of rabies.

	The baits contain a vaccine that, when consumed by a raccoon, will vaccinate the animal against the rabies virus. The goal of the Racoon Rabies Control Program is containment and elimination of terrestrial rabies in local wild animal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:33:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPbG91T0RQR09ZTTZFWTBOVXFRSFBYQnpzYXc3ZlRRS3hybTZIeV9Hc2FlZ0NHa1BWb244Rjl5Z2N3ZHgwbUtHLS1veVd5MTI2UU4wSlBDcDA4LTYyLVpqNHZpeTRGOHphbE0tTHFHR0FWS3B4TXhEM1ozWXQyUC1VcDFFa0hOdTlkTEhHMA</guid></item><item><title>“超级老人”的大脑似乎并不老化，现在科学家说他们知道原因- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/superagers-have-brains-that-dont-seem-to-age-now-scientists-say-they-know-why/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a quarter of a century, researchers have been tracking a rare group of older adults who defy expectations about aging. These “SuperAgers,” all aged 80 or older, seem to have brains that age more slowly while routinely scoring very high on memory tests – as well as people three decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their performance upends the notion that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; is an unavoidable consequence of growing old – and it’s giving scientists a roadmap to protect brain health deep into later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-superagers-brains"&gt;Studying SuperAgers’ brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SuperAging program began in the late 1990s, when neurologist M. Marsel Mesulam coined the term and launched an effort to find out what sets these individuals apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, 290 SuperAgers have enrolled, and 77 have donated their brains for study after death. The research blends years of cognitive testing, personality assessments, and high-resolution imaging with painstaking postmortem analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, researchers noticed a common thread among the living participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are unusually social and outgoing, reporting rich interpersonal networks and frequent engagement with others. But the most startling insights have come from the tissue under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really what we’ve found in their brains that’s been so earth-shattering for us,” said Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences, and neurology at &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-protects-superagers-brains"&gt;What protects SuperAgers’ brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathology tells a nuanced story. Some SuperAger brains show very little buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles the proteins that hallmark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-attacks-the-brain-in-two-separate-phases/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Others carry these lesions but appear unfazed by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,” Weintraub said. “One is resistance: they don’t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don’t do anything to their brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That “do nothing” is key. In typical aging, higher levels of amyloid and tau correlate with cortical thinning and memory decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SuperAgers, either the proteins are absent, or the brain’s networks seem to withstand their presence without measurable loss in function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This split – resistance versus resilience – could guide both preventive strategies and future treatments for Alzheimer’s and related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-that-stays-decades-younger"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Memory that stays decades younger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, SuperAgers clear a high bar. On a standard delayed word recall test, they score nine or better out of 15, a performance that mirrors average results for people in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference isn’t a fleeting testing trick; it persists year after year in longitudinal follow-up. That consistency allows scientists to distinguish a single lucky test day from a truly exceptional memory profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stronger-cortex-sharper-memory"&gt;Stronger cortex, sharper memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging adds another layer. Unlike typical older adults, SuperAgers do not show the widespread thinning of the cerebral cortex that comes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some regions they look even more robust than younger people. The anterior cingulate cortex – central to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/optimal-decision-making-is-a-balance-of-experience-and-knowledge/"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt;, motivation, and emotional control – often appears thicker in SuperAgers than in adults decades their junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern hints at why their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/words-like-this-and-that-direct-attention-across-languages/"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt;, motivation, and executive function remain so strong and may contribute directly to memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cells-of-connection-and-strength"&gt;Cells of connection and strength&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the microscope, two cellular details stand out. First, SuperAgers have more von Economo neurons – large, fast-signaling cells linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/social-curiosity-starts-young-and-helps-us-survive/"&gt;social behavior&lt;/a&gt; and intuition – than typically aging peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they show larger neurons in the entorhinal cortex, a hub for memory processing that’s among the first brain regions to falter in Alzheimer’s. Both traits suggest a structural and cellular foundation for the resilience seen at the systems level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social theme that emerges in personality measures may not be incidental. More &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Economo_neuron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Economo neurons&lt;/a&gt; could be part of the biological substrate underpinning the sociability many SuperAgers report, a behavioral pattern long associated with better cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-memory-before-decline"&gt;Protecting memory before decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and her colleagues see these findings as more than a scientific curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile,” she said. “This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers can mimic the protective features of SuperAger brains – or train the brain to resist or withstand pathology – clinical practice could shift from chasing symptoms to preserving function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may mean new pharmaceuticals aimed at bolstering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/infant-brains-are-more-organized-and-adaptable-than-we-thought/"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle interventions that amplify the brain’s natural “reserve,” or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reframes traditional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s research&lt;/a&gt;: rather than asking only how to remove amyloid or tau, scientists can also ask how to make the brain less vulnerable to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-superagers-lasting-legacy"&gt;SuperAgers’ lasting legacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of what we know comes from an extraordinary commitment by participants. SuperAgers are evaluated annually, and many choose to donate their brains for postmortem analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades,” said neuropsychologist Tamar Gefen, a co-author on the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-superagers-sharp-brains-future-health"&gt;SuperAgers, sharp brains, future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now probing why some brains resist pathology while others absorb it without consequence. Are there genetic signatures that predict resilience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do lifelong habits – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/older-adults-value-social-connection-over-their-own-health/"&gt;social engagement&lt;/a&gt;, aerobic fitness, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, cognitive challenge – interact with biology to produce the SuperAger profile? And can targeted interventions in midlife shift the brain toward the same protective patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 25 years, one message is already clear: cognitive decline isn’t a foregone conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subset of older adults retains memory performance on par with people decades younger, supported by unusual structural, cellular, and pathological profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SuperAgers show that the aging brain can be both tough and flexible – and that translating their biology into prevention could help more of us keep our minds keen well into our 80s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:09:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNakVBY3dDZHdUMVFXalIyaDRtT0dYTHZSNEpOTmhjTERVbXA2aWNEblEwTU0tN25RMDh0aGhQY255WTByZW9Oc0ExM09XaTREcjc3S3Rna0o5UzV4eFdQUkJJRkRiT1dCbWtqbVRDbGxkckhxWVJIUlRzTEZ1NFlhMkZfc3NsSENlNDVHOW5HSVo4allhWVBRVGFmYVhvcXFJMVk2ZHpaR20</guid></item><item><title>您的脖子揭示了您的健康状况-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/what-your-neck-reveals-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;More serious persistent pain can indicate disc herniation, compression of the spinal cord, spinal infection, spinal tumours and infections such as meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Swelling in the neck, accompanied by difficulty swallowing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also linked to the thyroid, this could indicate an iodine deficiency. This condition was once so common among people living in parts of Derbyshire, where &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/healthy-supplements-really/"&gt;iodine&lt;/a&gt; in diets was scarce, that it became known as Derbyshire neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Derbyshire neck is now rare in the UK, thanks to more varied diets and imported foods rich in iodine such as dairy and seafood, iodine deficiency is a growing concern in the UK, particularly among vulnerable groups like pregnant women, women of childbearing age and girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While severe deficiency is rare, studies have shown that mild to moderate deficiency is prevalent as a result of changing dietary habits, such as drinking less milk and a rise in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Nodes or lumps in the side of the neck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swollen glands in the neck are usually a sign the body is fighting an infection. Swollen glands can be accompanied by flu-like symptoms, a sore throat, a rough rash, scabs and sores, severe muscle aches, nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Swollen glands could suggest sepsis in the mouth or throat, or tonsillitis.” explains Dr Dilkes. “Tongue &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/throat-cancer-guide-larynx-pharynx-signs-symptoms/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Bulging vein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bulging, ropey vein in the neck can be a sign of increased pressure in the venous system, and while sometimes harmless, it can also indicate an underlying heart or circulatory problem, such as kidney or liver disease, right-sided heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jugular veins drain blood from the head and neck back to the heart and a bulging jugular vein can indicate that the right side of the heart isn’t pumping efficiently. If this is the case, blood can back-up into these veins, making them appear swollen or pulsating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dilkes explains: “In medical exams, clinicians use the height of the jugular vein as a visible gauge of central venous pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Throbbing lump&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often called a pulsatile mass, a new or enlarged throbbing &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/laryngeal-larynx-cancer-a-comprehensive-guide/"&gt;lump&lt;/a&gt; in the neck that beats in time with your pulse, or is on one side only, could mean an artery has weakened, ballooned or developed an abnormal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, a weak, a ballooned area that expands with each heartbeat could rupture (causing an aneurysm) or form a blood clot that travels to the brain, increasing the risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lump could also be a carotid body tumour (paraganglioma), which is a benign growth that develops on the small cluster of nerve tissue next to the carotid artery, a major blood vessel located on the side of the neck. Though usually not life-threatening, it often needs surgery or monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other causes could be trauma-related swelling, an enlarged thyroid artery or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal connection between arteries and veins that can result in death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Alzheimer's Association&lt;/a&gt;, dementia is not a specific disease. Rather, it's an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that is severe enough to interfere with daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's caused by damage to brain cells, which affects a person's ability to think, remember, and communicate. While &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-throws-away-video-tapes-ex-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; loss is the most well-known symptom, dementia also impacts focus, reasoning, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stage, a person can still be very independent, but may experience noticeable memory lapses. The middle stage is typically the longest, and this is where many of the unfiltered and surreal moments shared in this list can occur. As the disease progresses, social filters can fade, and the part of the brain that says "you probably shouldn't say that out loud" isn't working as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533597"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533597" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2148597169-68f8832a74f7d__700.jpg" alt="Young woman and elderly patient with dementia sharing a lighthearted moment while drinking tea on a sofa at home." title="Young woman and elderly patient with dementia sharing a lighthearted moment while drinking tea on a sofa at home."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;When my grandma had dementia she offered to steal a rug for me. “You like this rug?

The curious part is, the comment refers to events from 1865, a time the patient could not possibly have been alive. So, if it’s not a memory, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Bradley Bursack, an elder care consultant, explains that this is called &lt;a href="https://www.agingcare.com/articles/how-to-handle-alzheimers-disease-lying-144204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;confabulation&lt;/a&gt;, a common symptom in mid-to-late-stage dementia. The brain, struggling with significant memory gaps, will essentially create a plausible, though often historically or personally inaccurate, story to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person experiencing confabulation is not lying; they genuinely believe these created memories are true. Their brain's filing system is damaged, so it grabs bits and pieces of information from books, movies, or &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;historical events&lt;/a&gt; learned long ago and misapplies them to the present reality, leading to these deeply strange and often hilarious moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533681"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533681" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2149232318-68f88749c413a__700.jpg" alt="Young child sitting on an old yellow tractor outdoors, capturing a candid moment related to dementia patient stories." title="Young child sitting on an old yellow tractor outdoors, capturing a candid moment related to dementia patient stories."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My dementia patient was a farmer.

However, Dr. Andrew E. Budson &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/managing-your-memory/202405/dont-fight-false-memories-in-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that this is often the worst possible approach when dealing with dementia. He says that directly fighting or arguing with a false memory is not only ineffective but can be actively harmful, leading to increased distress for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key, Dr. Budson advises, is to remember that the person genuinely believes their false reality. Arguing with them is like arguing with you about what you had for breakfast; it feels like a personal attack. Instead of correcting, the recommended approach is to "go with the flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge their reality, validate the emotion behind it, and then gently redirect the conversation. The goal is not to win a factual debate but to maintain a positive, trusting connection and ensure your loved one feels safe and understood, even if their reality doesn't match our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533599"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533599" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2150494655-68f8836a56101__700.jpg" alt="Elderly woman reading a book calmly in a cozy home setting, reflecting moments of unfiltered and funny dementia patient quotes." title="Elderly woman reading a book calmly in a cozy home setting, reflecting moments of unfiltered and funny dementia patient quotes."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had one that wanted to teach me how to read.

As explained by the neuro-health company &lt;a href="https://optoceutics.com/weird-strange-odd-things-behaviors-dementia-patients-do/?srsltid=AfmBOoo3DpSFKX6pnRrdHTEept1_xH7WzuBZcFdyDq1zNqVcHS6D_2nx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Optoceutics&lt;/a&gt;, these shifts are a core part of the condition, and there are several common behaviors that can be observed in people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caregiver shared that their patient constantly believes it's their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/parents-give-thoughtless-gift-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;18th birthday&lt;/a&gt;, a happy memory the brain has decided to joyfully live in on repeat. Another noted that deep-seated prejudices, like racism, simply vanished, as if the part of the brain that held on to that learned negativity had been wiped clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it can be painful, not recognizing a child can sometimes lead to a sweet new beginning, like the parent who gossips about their kids, to their kids, as if they were new best friends instead!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533609"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533609" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/19092-68f89a650113f__700.jpg" alt="Young male doctor with glasses and stethoscope smiling confidently in a medical office, related to dementia patient care." title="Young male doctor with glasses and stethoscope smiling confidently in a medical office, related to dementia patient care."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;my grandfather had dementia and told my mom he took a trip to China so she asked the nurse about it. the specialist saw him that day and the dr was Chinese.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="www.tiktok.com/@neveah_hstfh/photo/7534856592936717599?cid=NzUzNTA3ODM3MTU1MjAxOTIzMQ" target="_blank"&gt; Mamabear &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/portrait-asian-doctor-white-coat-with-stethoscope-standing-office-smiling-camera_52355423.htm#from_element=cross_selling__photo" target="_blank"&gt; sodawhiskey &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/funniest-dementia-patients-stories-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9533612"&gt;  &lt;p id="9533612" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2149370432-68f886b3f2f75__700.jpg" alt="Elderly male patient with dementia in a wheelchair, wearing a green sweater, expressing an unfiltered and funny moment." title="Elderly male patient with dementia in a wheelchair, wearing a green sweater, expressing an unfiltered and funny moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;my grandpa had dementia and he told someone " you dont sweat that much for a fat person " and fully thought it was a compliment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="www.tiktok.com/@neveah_hstfh/photo/7534856592936717599?cid=NzUzNTE0MDM0OTQwMTc2MDU0Mg" target="_blank"&gt; Kris &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/old-patient-suffering-from-parkinson_25177981.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=3&amp;amp;uuid=c5cec629-5811-4245-9dfa-cd1d1fe4dd61&amp;amp;query=grandpa+dementia+patient" target="_blank"&gt; freepik &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/funniest-dementia-patients-stories-10/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a caregiver for someone with dementia is one of the most emotionally and physically demanding roles anyone can undertake. The daily challenges can be immense, which is why finding moments of light is not just a bonus; it's a crucial survival strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As caregiving experts at Onyx Home Care &lt;a href="https://onyxhomecare.com/how-to-stay-positive-and-find-joy-in-dementia-caregiving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt;, it is essential for caregivers to consciously look for opportunities to find joy and stay positive, both for their own well-being and for the person they are caring for. The stories shared in this list are a perfect example of this principle in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to embrace the surreal humor of a situation rather than fight it, these caregivers are finding a way to connect with their loved ones in the present moment. These flashes of laughter don't erase the heartbreak of the condition, but they are a powerful reminder of the enduring love that shines through, even in the most difficult of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have any hilarious anecdotes to share from your experiences with dementia?

&lt;p&gt;The bat was discovered around 2 p.m. Oct. 16 on the west side of the 500 block of South Main Street, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials urged anyone who touched the bat or saw someone else handle it to call the agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division at 714-834-8180, which operates 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners whose animals may have had contact with the bat should contact their veterinarian, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-fbvgdraj" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_fbvgdraj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal,” the agency said in a statement, adding that preventive treatment is safe and effective if administered promptly after possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency and OC Animal Care offered the following safety tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Avoid contact with wild animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Vaccinate cats and dogs against rabies&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;—Do not sleep with unscreened windows or doors open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Contact animal control if bats are found inside a home or building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Do not leave pet food outside where it could attract wild animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Wash animal bites immediately with soap and water and seek medical care&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;—Report animal bites to OC Animal Care at 714-935-6848&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals, usually by a bite, though rare cases have occurred through contact with the eyes, mouth or an open wound, officials said. Most U.S. human rabies cases in recent years have come from bats, whose small bites can go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that cysteine can activate an immune signaling process that encourages stem cells to grow new intestinal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enhanced ability to regenerate could help the body heal damage caused by radiation, which is a common side effect of cancer treatments. Although the study was conducted in mice, scientists say that if similar results are seen in humans, cysteine from food or supplements might offer a new way to help the intestine recover faster after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study suggests that if we give these patients a cysteine-rich diet or cysteine supplementation, perhaps we can dampen some of the chemotherapy or radiation-induced injury," says Omer Yilmaz, director of the MIT Stem Cell Initiative, an associate professor of biology at MIT, and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. "The beauty here is we're not using a synthetic molecule; we're exploiting a natural dietary compound."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that specific types of diets, including calorie restriction, can enhance the function of intestinal stem cells. However, this research is the first to pinpoint a single nutrient that directly boosts the gut's regenerative capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yilmaz is the senior author of the study, which was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The paper's lead author is Koch Institute postdoctoral researcher Fangtao Chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet and Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that diet plays a major role in health. High-fat diets can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, while low-calorie diets have been linked to longer lifespans in many species. Yilmaz's lab has long studied how different dietary patterns influence stem cell regeneration and has previously shown that both high-fat diets and short-term fasting can boost stem cell activity in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that macro diets such as high-sugar diets, high-fat diets, and low-calorie diets have a clear impact on health. But at the granular level, we know much less about how individual nutrients impact stem cell fate decisions, as well as tissue function and overall tissue health," Yilmaz says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest work, the MIT team fed mice diets high in one of 20 amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. They then analyzed how each amino acid affected stem cell growth in the intestine. Cysteine produced the strongest impact, greatly increasing both stem cells and progenitor cells (immature cells that develop into adult intestinal cells).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed that cysteine sets off a chain reaction that activates immune cells known as CD8 T cells. When intestinal cells absorb cysteine from food, they convert it into CoA, a cofactor that moves into the mucosal lining of the intestine. There, CD8 T cells take up CoA, which triggers them to multiply and release a signaling molecule called IL-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IL-22 plays a key role in regulating intestinal stem cell regeneration, but until now, scientists did not know that CD8 T cells could produce it. Once activated, these IL-22-releasing T cells help protect and repair the intestinal lining whenever it is injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's really exciting here is that feeding mice a cysteine-rich diet leads to the expansion of an immune cell population that we typically don't associate with IL-22 production and the regulation of intestinal stemness," Yilmaz says. "What happens in a cysteine-rich diet is that the pool of cells that make IL-22 increases, particularly the CD8 T-cell fraction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These T cells tend to cluster in the intestinal lining, placing them in the right location to respond quickly to damage. The researchers observed that the activation of CD8 T cells occurred mainly in the small intestine, not elsewhere in the digestive tract, likely because most dietary protein is absorbed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repairing Radiation and Chemotherapy Damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, mice on a cysteine-rich diet showed improved repair of radiation damage to the intestinal lining. In additional, unpublished work, the team found that the same diet helped regeneration after treatment with 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy drug commonly used for colon and pancreatic cancers that can also harm intestinal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine occurs naturally in many protein-rich foods, including meat, dairy, legumes, and nuts. The body can also make cysteine by converting another amino acid, methionine, in the liver. However, the cysteine produced internally circulates throughout the body rather than concentrating in the intestine the way dietary cysteine does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With our high-cysteine diet, the gut is the first place that sees a high amount of cysteine," Chi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cysteine has long been known for its antioxidant properties, but this study is the first to show that it also helps intestinal stem cells regenerate. The researchers are now exploring whether cysteine can stimulate regeneration in other tissues as well. One ongoing project is testing whether cysteine can promote hair follicle regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also plan to continue investigating other amino acids that may influence stem cell renewal and gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think we're going to uncover multiple new mechanisms for how these amino acids regulate cell fate decisions and gut health in the small intestine and colon," Yilmaz says.&lt;/p&gt;

It is chemistry, biology, and chance working together in every cell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have searched for measurable signs in the body that tell how well life is aging. These signs, called biomarkers, can reveal more than just years – they can whisper how healthy the body truly is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists studying dogs have found molecular traces that could help explain aging in both animals and humans. These findings could reshape how researchers study longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking these molecules, scientists may soon measure not only how fast aging happens but also how to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery offers a glimpse into a shared biological story between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-pandemic-changed-dog-behavior-over-3-years/"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, written in the language of chemistry, resilience, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-as-aging-mirrors"&gt;Dogs as aging mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt; analyzed blood from almost 800 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dogs live in homes, eat family food, and breathe the same air as their owners. Their shared environments make them powerful models for human biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that about 40 percent of small molecules in the dogs’ blood shifted with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These molecules, known as metabolites, are basically the building blocks of life,” said Daniel Promislow, senior scientist and scientific advisor at the HNRCA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They serve as the raw materials for forming proteins, DNA, and other cellular components, and play a critical role in keeping cells alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery hints that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mapping-disease-patterns-in-dogs-can-reveal-whats-ahead/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; reshapes metabolism deeply. The body does not just slow down – it changes the way its chemistry works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-clues-in-dogs"&gt;Aging clues in dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the thousands of molecules examined, one group stood out. These were post-translationally modified amino acids, or ptmAAs. They form when proteins break apart or when gut bacteria tinker with nutrients during digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that ptmAAs appeared more often in older dogs, no matter the breed or size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These metabolites are created in two ways in the body,” explained Promislow. “The bacteria in our guts can make ptmAAs as we digest our food, or they can show up when proteins break down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery connects aging to how the body manages its proteins. When these molecules accumulate, they might signal slower recycling of proteins or rising wear inside &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/training-service-dogs-slows-aging-and-stress-in-veterans/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt;. Each change reflects a shift in how the body maintains itself over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kidneys-show-aging-impacts"&gt;Kidneys show aging impacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pattern stood out clearly. Dogs with weaker kidneys carried higher levels of these modified amino acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys normally filter protein byproducts out of the blood. When filtration weakens, these chemicals stay behind, building up in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That buildup may reveal how well the body clears its own waste. It also helps explain why some animals seem to age more gently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger kidney function might keep the blood cleaner and the body healthier longer. Because humans share similar biology, the finding may apply to us too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-dogs-over-years"&gt;Tracking dogs over years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study captured a single moment – a comparison between young and old dogs. But aging is a story written slowly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to follow the same dogs for years to see how these metabolites change. Tracking individual dogs will help reveal whether these molecules predict future &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-owners-ages-and-beliefs-influence-their-pet-food-choices/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, not just describe the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will also explore how gut microbes influence these aging signals. Changes in the gut community can alter metabolism and immune balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain bacteria drive the rise of ptmAAs, targeting those microbes could one day help slow aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-dogs-teach-about-aging"&gt;What dogs teach about aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing results in dogs and humans, scientists hope to find universal signs of aging. Such biomarkers could guide new treatments, showing whether an intervention truly keeps the body younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dog Aging Project’s massive dataset, rich with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle information, makes that possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promislow sees a shared benefit ahead. “We have a tremendous opportunity to understand the causes and consequences of aging and to discover ways to ensure that both species enjoy the healthiest aging trajectory possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs may not live as long as humans, but their lives unfold faster – and in that speed, science can read the script of aging. Every wagging tail and every heartbeat might hold clues to how both species can stay stronger, healthier, and more vibrant for longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their shorter lifespans allow scientists to observe decades of biological change within years, revealing how organs adapt, how cells repair damage, and how lifestyle influences longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8ccbe339-cbe1-4cd6-a8be-c11242db49b8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8b05bbf5-d035-4b30-9a95-ff1d53f72d45"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-b12e5732-0b61-49a5-9936-fb4b54f06e7f"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-dcccefa8-a45e-4859-829e-cb01c7743ac3"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:02:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5VV1hFQ2k4aURjYTdZRkdqMnFXM3hiUWtHWFlTT1Y2OU9EaF9aUmlNVUxoOG5rYVJkTVlVTFZ5MnlqVTM1VVFpc1drbURDWUF4dVlvajhuSmhLZU5nbFhHVnBMSUhWVURWeHVGS0w4Q3lqODZJWWE1X1hPM3BYQQ</guid></item><item><title>Chai与咖啡：哪种对能量、消化和心脏健康有益？ - Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/chai-vs-coffee-11832964</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway_1-0" class="comp health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway health-sc-block-callout-base mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-key-takeaway theme-key-takeaway" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee gives you more energy because it has more caffeine than chai.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chai is gentler on the stomach and might be better if coffee upsets your stomach.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both coffee and chai are good for your heart because they have antioxidants.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chai is a traditional drink from India that's made from boiling black tea (often Assam tea) with milk and sugar. A variation of the drink, called masala chai, includes aromatic spices like ginger, cardamom, cloves, and black pepper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both coffee and chai offer several health benefits when consumed regularly. However, the main difference between these two is the caffeine content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-coffee-has-a-lot-more-caffeine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Coffee Has a Lot More Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the black tea used for chai does provide a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-energy-drinks-11824927" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt;, coffee provides about twice as much caffeine per cup:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80-100 milligrams in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30-50 milligrams in chai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Coffee provides more of an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/snacks-that-boost-your-energy-more-than-a-cup-of-coffee-11760875" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;energy boost due to its higher caffeine content&lt;/a&gt;. It can increase alertness, improve physical performance, and sharpen focus," said &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/overviewcoph/faculty/lywright" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, director of nutrition programs and an associate professor at USF College of Public Health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She said this makes coffee a good choice for people who tolerate caffeine well and are looking for a stronger mental and physical boost, especially in the morning or before workouts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some, the jolt can lead to jitteriness, anxiety, or even disrupted sleep. Because chai has less caffeine and an amino acid called L-theanine, it tends to provide a gentler energy boost than coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Many drinkers describe it as 'calm energy,'" Wright said. "People who are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-allergy-83178" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, have reflux, or struggle with anxiety may do better with chai."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-chai-might-be-easier-on-your-stomach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Chai Might Be Easier on Your Stomach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result of its bitter compounds, coffee can stimulate digestive processes, said &lt;a href="https://stjudewellnesscenter.org/meet-our-dietitians/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Megan Wroe, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and the wellness manager at Providence St. Jude Medical Center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But some of its compounds can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-7111848" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;trigger IBS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and be hard on the digestive system, she added. For those with sensitive stomachs, the high caffeine content can also lead to digestive issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chai, on the other hand, is easier on the stomach because of its low caffeine content. If you get masala chai, which typically contains ginger, it can soothe the stomach, aid digestion, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ginger-for-nausea-8740699" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relieve nausea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wroe explained that coffee and chai both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contain polyphenols and antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, which are good for the immune and cardiovascular systems.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She said there is a vast amount of research showing consumption of either is associated with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-all-cause-mortality-2223349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduction in all-cause deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long-term studies consistently link moderate coffee consumption with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tea drinkers, especially regular black or green tea drinkers, experience similar benefits,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which she said is likely due to the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/tea-health-benefits-11812040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyphenols and flavonoids in tea leaves&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you tolerate caffeine well enough, no rule says you must choose one drink over another. In fact, many people enjoy both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Some choose coffee to start the day and drink chai in the afternoon when they want something warm and flavorful without the same caffeine levels," Wright said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If caffeine causes you anxiety, upsets your stomach, or disrupts your sleep, she said you may want to opt for chai or even decaffeinated coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's important to note that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/too-much-caffeine-11802174" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FDA’s general guideline on caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is no more than 400 milligrams per day, which is about four 8-ounce cups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Whether choosing coffee or chai, I caution consumers to read labels of pre-made versions and be aware of milk and sugar additions they add themselves," Wroe noted. "High sugar and additives often found in these drinks create inflammatory effects that somewhat cancel the other benefits."&lt;br&gt;

Around 6 million to 8 million cases are recorded in the United States every year, and around &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection" target="_blank"&gt;80% are caused by E. coli bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But the strains responsible for the majority of UTIs are not the ones typically associated with foodborne illnesses, which cause diarrhea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8abcda" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank"&gt;published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal mBio, hints at the prevalence of foodborne UTIs, which were largely unknown to scientists two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4faf66" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is the latest in a long series of studies that have shown that we’re getting some of our urinary tract infections from food,” said Dr. Martin Blaser, a microbiologist at Rutgers University, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da3ec2" class="body-graf"&gt;“A study like this allows people to draw inferences, to understand what’s going on,” he added. “If somebody develops a urinary tract infection, they’re now wondering, ‘Well, was it the hamburger I ate three days ago or five days ago?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d102f" class="body-graf"&gt;When E. coli bacteria from food wind up causing a UTI, they first enter the gut after people touch contaminated meat in the cooking process or eat undercooked meat. From there, the bacteria can get into the urethra as a result of poor hygiene or improper wiping in the bathroom, then ascend into the urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25cebe" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the study’s authors, Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, said he was inspired to investigate the link between UTIs and contaminated meat about 15 years ago, when he noticed that most of the chicken and turkey he tested carried the bacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-796bfe" class="body-graf"&gt;“For some reason, that was basically being ignored. If it didn’t cause diarrhea, it was being ignored. And so that started me on this path,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad4fc5" class="body-graf"&gt;Price’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000381" target="_blank"&gt;previous research estimated, based on modeling, &lt;/a&gt;that foodborne E. coli could account for up to 640,000 UTIs in the United States every year — around 8% of the total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5dc1ce" class="body-graf"&gt;His new findings come from a collaboration with researchers at Kaiser Permanente, who collected more than 2,300 urine samples that were positive for E. coli in Southern California from 2017 to 2021. They also took more than 3,300 samples from meat sold in major grocery stores in the area over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ef358" class="body-graf"&gt;A lab at George Washington University then analyzed the genetic material to determine the origins of people’s infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-431eac" class="body-graf"&gt;“Strains have different DNA signatures, and you can see whether the strains in the animals and the strains in the people match up or not. And they found a number of matches,” Blaser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4e2ee" class="body-graf"&gt;Among the meat sampled, contamination rates were highest in chicken and turkey products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02f5e9" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also found that low-income neighborhoods in Southern California had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs than wealthier neighborhoods. Price and his co-authors suggested that grocery stores in those areas might not have proper storage temperatures or that they may keep products out for too long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1a809" class="body-graf"&gt;Price said he has seen poorly packaged meat sold in some stores in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d37b2" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would buy these packages of chicken that were just bloated, just so full of saline that when I put it on the conveyor belt ... it would just be wet,” he said. “And I know what’s in that liquid: It’s bacteria, and often drug-resistant bacteria, that’s spilling onto these conveyor belts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-640c3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Urinary tract infections can cause painful and frequent urination, and if they are left untreated, they can lead to serious or life-threatening complications, so people with suspected UTIs should seek treatment right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbc9d3" class="body-graf"&gt;“The bladder is a major gateway to the bloodstream for E. coli. And when you get these E. coli in your blood, they can kill you,” Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb6add" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors treat UTIs with the same antibiotics regardless of whether the E. coli originated from contaminated meat or another source. (Doctors and patients rarely know the source of an infection, Price said.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f74442" class="body-graf"&gt;Although thoroughly cooking meat and poultry can kill bacteria, Price said, the transmission of foodborne E. coli is mostly due to cross-contamination in the kitchen, so it is important to keep raw meat separate from other items and wash your hands thoroughly after you prepare food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aebd09" class="body-graf"&gt;His study also recommends that meat producers and regulatory agencies consider stricter measures to limit E. coli contamination, such as making sure packages are sealed tightly and do not contain excess liquid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcaca2" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Everybody should have leak-proof packaging in the United States,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOaHV4UFI4NkwwR3ZyV2NsSmVZdkYyUTlKOWdIMk42LW9hX1RuUmNob24wOWkwMGJHQThzUDlRXzZhRi1KUDgtLWdVUVRFNTlpX1Z3eVFYa2F6VUF6REZMRFZsVFZJeW1oTWhfcU5SdThUM1pnWWlGSVh5NXZCbDM3Ml9HTlpqNE5pcXJ0MFNoZjdZSTY1YnE2NGxnZlY2RXZDNU8tVlMtVVdjd9IBVkFVX3lxTFBEWGtKajRqaFo4aS04Tndpc0x1aE9DckVnMDQxOTNzbWVoLWhfRzM1YVVkMUlDbXh6T1UxdzdoWWg2UUQyeEcxeW43MGdQXzhuaWVoLXdn</guid></item><item><title>妈妈醉酒女孩的旅行事故揭示了令人震惊的健康诊断并挽救了她的生命： “奇迹” - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/mom-drunken-girls-trip-mishap-123007884.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Butlins in Minehead in the U.K.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thinking she may have broken or bruised her rib during a drunken weekend away with friends, Charlotte Morjaria, 31, headed to the hospital where doctors discovered something more sinister was going on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that moment, it was probably the most scared I've ever been in my life," the mother of one told BBC Wales of her diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria was diagnosed with kidney cancer after medics found a sizable cancerous tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 31-year-old British woman has a drunken weekend away with her two best friends to thank for potentially saving her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Charlotte Morjaria, who lives in Newport in Wales, headed to a Butlin's seaside resort in the town of Minehead in Somerset, England, for a girls' trip, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c864dg1wvplo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC Wales;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC Wales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the vacation, the trio joined a bachelor party and were playing a game of tag when one of the men picked Morjaria up and lifted her over his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then that she heard something "go pop," but carried on having fun before heading to the hospital the following day once she had returned home to get checked out, thinking she might have broken or bruised a rib, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probably a tad too much drinking, albeit we were having a fantastic time before disaster struck — or you could call it a miracle," Morjaria, who was 30 at the time of the injury, told BBC Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at the hospital, the mother of one learned that her ribs were fine, but medics had discovered a "sizeable" cancerous tumor on her kidney, per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Titmuss/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty&lt;/p&gt; Butlins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that moment, it was probably the most scared I've ever been in my life," she said, insisting that she had no idea the tumor — which was 2.5 inches in size — was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said they'd found a sizeable mass on my left kidney," said Morjaria, who almost left the hospital's waiting room several times after having to wait for 22 hours, before her mom and her friend persuaded her to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was told the tumor was being treated as cancer, which she couldn't believe, telling the outlet, "The conversation was a strange one, because I thought I was fine. There really weren't very big tell-tale signs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria — who was sent from The Grange Hospital to nearby Royal Gwent Hospital — ended up being diagnosed with stage one of a rare form of kidney cancer: &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-kidney-tumors/translocation-renal-cell-carcinoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TFE3 renal cell carcinoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TFE3 renal cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had surgery to have her kidney removed in August of this year, a day before she turned 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria told BBC Wales, "[My consultant] had only heard of one case, it is rare. They didn't have a lot of information," adding, "Thankfully it hadn't spread ... but they still needed to get it out pretty quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Horwood/Getty&lt;/p&gt; Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Wales&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morjaria — who was told in September that she's cancer free, but still has to have regular scans as she's seen as high risk — told the outlet that there were quite a few factors that could have hidden any symptoms of weight loss, chronic fatigue and back pain before her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she had the "normal aches and pains," but just put it down to running around after her "absolutely crazy" son, Sebastian, 2.

People sip it for weight, dab it on skin, and drop it into morning water. A little diluted vinegar now and then might be harmless for many, but used chronically or undiluted and especially when people rely on supplements or poorly made commercial bottles, ACV can cause real harm. Here are six severe side effects specialists see in the clinic and in the literature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tooth enamel erosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACV is highly acidic. Repeated exposure softens and erodes tooth enamel in ways similar to acidic drinks. An 8-week randomised &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297831/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and in-vitro studies show measurable enamel wear and tooth surface changes after regular vinegar ingestion or exposure. Even diluted daily “shots” can accelerate enamel loss over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous drops in potassium (hypokalemia) and bone loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic, large-volume ingestion has been linked to low potassium levels - a condition that can cause muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and even cardiac arrest in extreme cases. In fact, a well-documented &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9736833/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;case report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; even links prolonged cider-vinegar consumption to hypokalemia and subsequent osteoporosis, showing how sustained misuse can impact bone health.

It can lower blood glucose and magnify the effect of diabetes medications, risking hypoglycaemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can lower potassium and thus increase toxicity risk with drugs like digoxin. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and some laxatives may also interact. If you’re on prescription medicine, discuss ACV with your clinician before starting regular use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slowed gastric emptying, a hidden hazard for people with diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprising to many, vinegar can delay &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2245945/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;gastric emptying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. For people with diabetic gastroparesis, that means worse glycaemic control and unpredictable blood sugar swings; even for others, slowed digestion can cause nausea and bloating. A controlled study showed vinegar reduced gastric emptying rates in people with type 1 diabetes and gastroparesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chemical burns and skin damage from topical use&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of “natural equals safe” is costly when people apply undiluted ACV to the skin.

Investigations of commercial products, especially tablets and some branded preparations, found wide variability in pH, acid content and label claims; some products were pasteurised or filtered (removing the “mother”), others had much lower or inconsistent acetic acid levels than advertised. In short: many commercial varieties are not truly aged, unpasteurized, or standardized, which undermines both safety and the very benefits people expect. Consumers should prefer reputable, clearly labelled raw/unfiltered products and treat supplements with caution, checking for ingredient transparency, manufacturing origin, and expiry dates to ensure authenticity and consistent quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical guidance (short and clinical)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t drink undiluted ACV.

If you use ACV for a specific reason, set a time limit and monitor side effects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t apply undiluted vinegar to skin. For oral health, avoid swishing ACV and rinse with water after use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple cider vinegar can be useful in the kitchen and has some modest, documented metabolic effects. But it is an acid first and a remedy second. Used recklessly, chronically, undiluted, or in unreliable commercial forms, it can cause serious, preventable harm. Nutrition experts should be louder about the risks, and patients should expect clear, evidence-based advice before making ACV a daily habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 12:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19疫苗可以帮助一些癌症患者对抗肿瘤- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The most widely used &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; may offer a surprise benefit for some cancer patients – revving up their immune systems to help fight tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00063b6qyepwfa39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/4c83cc7cc92a430b8c026691e77815c2" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy drugs&lt;/a&gt; lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00073b6q6epnm2ri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it had nothing to do with virus infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00083b6qj2jml1sn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mrna-kennedy-rfk-jr-covid-flu-51babaaeb003c45473080a52d67d7d72" target="_blank"&gt;the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA&lt;/a&gt;, appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00093b6qvo9ahzw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine “acts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,” said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. “We’re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000a3b6qjky8kzw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank"&gt;cutting $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; for some uses of the technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000b3b6qfym710z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000c3b6qgq5f5j1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPsgoqfas&amp;amp;list=PLslqZ7OaczKEUNNDVq-u_OE31P2k7UwKc&amp;amp;index=19" target="_blank"&gt;Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000d3b6q0z0vw6l4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-71306bd18785477f3a85a69caa6e09c9" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000e3b6qvcrqmhrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000f3b6qqx2m7dp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000g3b6qjf4hfwyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000h3b6qajtq56em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000i3b6qgagydoxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000j3b6qhe6ovmbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once your profile is live, you can begin scrolling. “Around 70 per cent of donors on the app offer their sperm for free,” says Sofie Hafström Kritsotaki, the app’s co-founder. “While around 40 per cent of future parents are willing to pay the donor for their support.” When you search for a match on the app, you can stipulate whether you want the donation to be “free” or “with compensation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From what we know, if they agree on compensation, it’s usually in the range of £50-£100, to cover time spent and travel costs. This is not arranged through our platform, but between the parties themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many donors include both current and childhood photos, giving prospective parents a glimpse of their future child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is Juan*, 31, from Catalonia, who prefers “intercourse” as a method of donation; or Stephen*, 41, a bus driver from Somerset seeking home insemination via a clinic. “Always wanted to be a dad but the situation never arose,” he writes. “Not sure it will ever happen for me before I’m too old, but I want to help others achieve their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many women, these platforms offer a pragmatic alternative to the high costs and long waiting lists of licensed clinics. Despite several regulated sperm banks across the UK, supply remains chronically short. Under HFEA rules, an official donor’s sperm can only be used to create a maximum of 10 families – a limit designed to reduce the risk of accidental genetic links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official fertility treatment, meanwhile, can be financially crippling. Intrauterine insemination (IUI), where prepared sperm is placed directly into the womb, costs around £1,500 per cycle privately, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/parenting/fertility/beginners-guide-to-ivf/"&gt;in vitro fertilisation (IVF)&lt;/a&gt; – where the egg and sperm are combined in a lab and the embryo is then transferred to the uterus – substantially more. NHS coverage varies by region and is often available only after multiple paid cycles have failed. For many single women and same-sex couples, conception through official channels feels financially out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That economic reality has created a shadow system. And despite the potential pitfalls, unregulated donation offers something the clinics cannot: choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hi, how picky do you think you can be?” one woman asks on Sperm Donors UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I was to conceive a son, is it too picky to try to find a donor who also has thick, full hair?” A donor replies: “Absolutely you can be picky. I won’t donate to overweight and unhealthy-looking women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Natalie Lovejoy, 42, from Wiltshire, it was less about choosiness than practicality. “I still hadn’t met anyone and, two years ago, I realised dating apps were awful, and my relationships weren’t going anywhere,” she says. “I know I want a baby, so I’m going to have a baby, and then love will come later.”&lt;/p&gt;

They also were more likely to say that they lost weight, were able to concentrate more, and had better energy than they did before. The researchers even noticed physical changes, like the participants had better blood pressure, vascular health, and liver function, and had less &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a64254355/supplements-for-insulin-resistance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered a precursor to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who cut back—but didn’t quit entirely—saw some improvements in those health metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants were also more likely to drink less and have less signs of alcohol use disorder during a six-month follow-up. Dry January “likely provided an opportunity for self-reflection,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fcitations%3Fuser%3DmyHwm9EAAAAJ%26hl%3Den&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69123057%2Fsober-october-no-alcohol-benefits-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Megan Strowger, PhD;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Megan Strowger, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and post-doctoral research associate at University at Buffalo. “Dry January is a great opportunity to re-evaluate your relationship with alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does skipping alcohol for a month benefit your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, alcoholic drinks have calories, and they can also impact how much people eat, says &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/susan-kelly-weeder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Susan Kelly-Weeder, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Susan Kelly-Weeder, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; researcher and dean of the George Washington University School of Nursing. “People often eat after drinking in an attempt to decrease the impact of the alcohol and so consume extra calories,” she says, adding that drinking lowers inhibitions, which could further influence what and how much you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being at an unhealthy weight can raise the risk of a host of health issues, while cutting out alcohol can help with healthy weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, alcohol can mess with your sleep, which can impact your physical and mental health, Kelly-Weeder points out. “Most adults do not get enough quality sleep and we know that alcohol use interferes with deep restful sleep,” she says. “Once alcohol is eliminated, people begin to sleep better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the mental health side, alcohol can do a number on your brain, Strowger says. “Alcohol’s reputation is people having fun and the social benefits, but alcohol is fundamentally a depressant. Over time, that can impact mood, happiness, and mental health. By removing that influence in a short period [like Sober October or Dry January], it allows the brain to stabilize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you cut back (but don't quit)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found you can still see health perks if you just drink here and there. “The key takeaway is that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reduction in alcohol consumption helps,” Strowger says. Even if someone didn’t fully avoid alcohol for the entire month, cutting back from their usual amount resulted in some health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, experts say it’s a good idea to reduce your alcohol use when you can. “Every little bit helps,” Kelly-Weeder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:36:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5oOFJ3VlpSV2NPVnA3S0Vhb1ZaZk02dHFFQXRaMkFJY2hlMnkxdlRkZ1RxaWQ5RTgzXzI4R3loSjA1UVFKSkN5M0xnNTRadjR1NEE5R0ltaTV6ZVMtUGNhRFdBeU9YUHRoRGZKRWszU2RTLV9sal9oWGdjdTI</guid></item><item><title>头发灰白可能会带来令人惊讶的健康益处- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/there-could-be-a-surprising-health-benefit-to-having-gray-hair-81293</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;Going gray is an inevitable, and for many, undesirable, part of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/aging" target="_blank"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, but health-wise, it’s no bad thing – it could reflect the body’s natural defense against cancer, new research in mice suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only gate-screenreader--text"&gt;The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by researchers from the University of Tokyo, investigated how hair follicle stem cells responded to DNA damage, and in doing so, revealed a surprising link between &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/scientists-pinpoint-how-stress-turns-hair-gray-54754" target="_blank"&gt;gray hair&lt;/a&gt; and melanoma – a type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of their lifetime, our cells face continuous stress, from both internal and environmental sources, collectively termed the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/does-your-dna-predict-your-destiny-68724" target="_blank"&gt;exposome&lt;/a&gt;. This stress can damage our DNA, which contributes to both aging and cancer, although exactly how has remained a mystery, especially when it comes to stem cell damage and long-term tissue health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/stem-cells" target="_blank"&gt;Stem cells&lt;/a&gt; are unique cells that can self-renew and develop into many different cell types in the body. Depending on where they are found, stem cells can develop into different tissues. Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs), for example, reside in the hair follicle and can differentiate into mature melanocytes, pigment-producing cells that give our hair and skin their color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind the new study used a mouse model to identify how McSCs respond to different types of DNA damage. They found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks – where the phosphate backbone of both DNA strands is broken – McSCs irreversibly differentiate and are lost, leading to hair graying. This process is known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, when the stem cells were exposed to some carcinogens, they avoided this differentiation pathway, even when the DNA was damaged, retaining their ability to self-renew and divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when placed under stress, McSCs face a decision: to differentiate and exit the system, resulting in graying, or carry on dividing, which may eventually lead to a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates – exhaustion or expansion – depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals,” co-lead author Professor Emi Nishimura explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are keen to stress that their findings do not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, merely that seno-differentiation induced by stress could protect against harmful cells while simultaneously steering hair toward a silvery fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the research was carried out in mice, so we shouldn’t make any assumptions about our own species just yet, but it certainly helps to further our understanding of the process of hair graying and how it relates to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:34:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQcWI1T0NqVm4yaHNacEhGQnprcG9ZNUdpcHI3QTlBLUo2dXp3aGRaX3NHTVRkMnp3U0JQS2hqbmVXUWk0Q1ZUZjRsV1V6M0diZ2JXMEtMM3JMaUUyRS1NaFdWaUFOMHI1eDByUlYzWDBlQVJEZEtVY3FqOGtQemd6RzNUejBiWWpUNGpIcml5S1JnbXJ2Q0FlQUFnQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁后保持大脑敏锐的5个简单日常习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/5-simple-daily-habits-to-keep-your-brain-sharp-after-40/photostory/124761393.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain nutrients like omega-3s, antioxidants, and vitamins play an important role in brain health, and so they should be included in one's daily diet to boost memory and brain functioning.

            Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28379i00063b6qwk0h4nty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With Manookian in &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6ro3bt-idahos-health-freedom-act-becomes-law.html" target="_blank"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt; are two of her allies, the leaders of Health Freedom Idaho. It was April 4, hours after the governor signed the &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title73/t73ch5/" target="_blank"&gt;Idaho Medical Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt; into law.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh27kg8200003b6qawgsdcip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The act makes it illegal for state and local governments, private businesses, employers, schools and daycares to require anyone to take a vaccine or receive any other “medical intervention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmh2fgrvn003v3b6q3d6quy66@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283gfv000c3b6qjzcq6oge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether the law will actually alter day-to-day life in Idaho is an open question, because Idaho already made it easy to get around the few existing vaccination requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283gfv000d3b6q9l5rl5sq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it could have a significant effect in other states, where rules aren’t already so relaxed. And it comes at a time when diseases once eradicated from the U.S. through vaccination are making a resurgence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283f7h000a3b6qw9fh0dzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The law runs against one of the hallmarks of modern public health: that a person’s full participation in society depends on their willingness to follow certain rules. (Want to send your child to public school? They’ll need a measles vaccine. Want to work in a retirement community during flu season? You might have to wear a mask.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000i3b6qgete73be@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Idaho law flips that on its head. It not only removes the obligation to follow such rules, it makes the rules themselves illegal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000j3b6qgcjs50p4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new law sets Idaho apart from even conservative-leaning South Carolina, where &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unvaccinated-students-quarantining-measles-south-carolina/" target="_blank"&gt;two schools recently&lt;/a&gt; quarantined more than 150 unvaccinated children after measles arrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000k3b6q4hu5lvj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A person &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html#:~:text=Disease%20course,4%20days%20after%20rash%20onset" target="_blank"&gt;can spread measles&lt;/a&gt; for four days before symptoms appear. During the South Carolina schools’ quarantine, five students began to show symptoms, but the quarantine kept them from spreading it, &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-16-total-2025-12-related-upstate" target="_blank"&gt;the health department said this month&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000l3b6qrilyw9f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That precaution would now be illegal in Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000m3b6qj3ch7app@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho’s law caught the attention of people who share Manookian’s belief that — contrary to &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of years of public health evidence and rigorous regulation in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; — vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000n3b6qp3m1y8sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also caught the attention of people like Jennifer Herricks, a pro-vaccine advocate in Louisiana and &lt;a href="https://www.familiesforvaccines.org/staff-bios/#jenniferherricks" target="_blank"&gt;advocacy director for American Families for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283pvm000g3b6qqqvnl99h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Herricks and her counterparts in other states say that vaccine requirements have “done so much good for our kids and for our communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000s3b6qwq8stm7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;analysis published last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; found that routine childhood vaccines prevented more than 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations in the U.S. over three decades, saving $540 billion in direct costs and saving society about $2.7 trillion. The analysis was limited; it didn’t account for the lives and money saved by vaccines for flu or RSV, which kill and hospitalize babies and children each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000t3b6qyx9ibixg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho’s move was “pretty concerning,” Herricks said, “especially seeing the direction that everything is headed at the federal government.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000u3b6qsp8rpw7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The law is the culmination of a decade of anti-vaccine activism that got a boost from the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000v3b6q0fe8u7uu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s rooted in a belief system that distrusts institutions — government health agencies, vaccine makers, medical societies and others — on the premise that those institutions seek only money and control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000w3b6qqv2t72f7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian said in an interview that she believes one person should never be told to risk their health in “the theoretical” service of another.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000x3b6qwdbpumvb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manookian and her allies have a new goal in their sights: to make Idaho’s legislation a nationwide standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="vossi-divider" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/divider/instances/cmh2fjc2n00433b6qe2upy654@published" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2842d1000q3b6quwauaxj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho was already more permissive than other states when it came to vaccine rules. Parents since at least the 1990s could send unvaccinated children to school if they signed a form saying vaccination went against their religious or personal beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00143b6qk7k3bkni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That wasn’t good enough for Idahoans who describe themselves as advocates for health freedom. They worked to shift the paradigm, bit by bit, so that it can be easier now for parents to get a vaccine exemption than to show the school their child is actually vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00153b6q8m1odeo0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In recent years, lawmakers ordered schools and daycare centers to tell parents about &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title39/T39CH48/SECT39-4801/" target="_blank"&gt;the exemptions allowed in Idaho&lt;/a&gt; whenever they communicate about immunizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00163b6qlwwjvhh7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state also decided to let parents exempt their kids by writing a note, instead of having to fill out a form — one that, in the past, required them to acknowledge the risks of going unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00173b6qbawdi4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (There is conflicting data on whether these changes truly affected vaccination rates or just led more parents to skip the trouble of handing in vaccine records. Starting in 2021, Idaho schools reported a steady drop in the share of kindergartners with documented vaccinations. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childvaxview/about/interactive-reports.html" target="_blank"&gt;Phone surveys&lt;/a&gt; of parents, by contrast, showed vaccination rates have been largely unchanged.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00183b6qwz2h4qqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An enduring backlash against Idaho’s short-lived COVID-19 mandates gave Manookian’s movement more momentum, culminating this year in what she considered the ultimate step in Idaho’s evolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00193b6q8crxnzw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian had a previous career in finance in New York and London. She transitioned to work as a homeopath and advocate, ultimately returning to her home state of Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284jn800123b6qv19975d2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bill she came up with said that almost nobody can be required to have a vaccine or take any test or medical procedure or treatment in order to go to school, get a job or go about life how they’d like to. In practice, that would mean schools couldn’t send unvaccinated kids home, even during a measles outbreak, and private businesses and daycares couldn’t require people on their property to follow public health guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284xb7001e3b6qy53ay4pb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284vva001c3b6qsvqaorn9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her theory was right, ultimately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001j3b6qapsmxvfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001k3b6q6rgroaj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001l3b6qenatem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the governor vetoed it. &lt;a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/veto_s-1023aaaa_2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001m3b6qwlpcvgoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001n3b6q4hq4och7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, Little signed it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="vossi-divider" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/divider/instances/cmh2fjmbv00463b6qj6cyn8bs@published" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2856jy001h3b6qmx0c19u2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, D.C., for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285ob5001u3b6qyq6umh4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285ob5001v3b6qlbkx1vxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fONtd73sNJg?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=81" target="_blank"&gt;told the audience&lt;/a&gt; in May.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285ob5001w3b6qzyfz6w09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285n48001s3b6qcmnckkz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing &lt;a href="https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/" target="_blank"&gt;model legislation and a how-to guide&lt;/a&gt;, with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://standforhealthfreedom.com/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;Stand For Health Freedom&lt;/a&gt; to mobilize activists in every state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285yyf00213b6q1loqbusp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview with ProPublica, Manookian said her objective is for people to “understand and appreciate that the most basic and fundamental of human rights is the right to direct our own medical treatment — and to codify that in law in every state. Breaking that barrier in Idaho proves that it can be done, that Americans understand the importance of this, and the humanity of it, and that it should be done in other states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285yyf00223b6qjjp9o7om@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her efforts were rewarded over the summer with a visit from none other than Kennedy, who visited Boise and toured a farm &lt;a href="https://x.com/LeslieManookian/status/1950684276510629904" target="_blank"&gt;with Manookian and state lawmakers in tow.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285yyf00233b6qchq9myla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This state, more than any other state in the country” aligns with the MAHA campaign, Kennedy told reporters at a news conference where no one was allowed to ask questions. Kennedy called Idaho “the home of medical freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285x9j001z3b6qok66uvdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment from Kennedy or his staff on Idaho’s law and his visit to the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq00283b6qc2fh8pn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children’s Health Defense, the organization Kennedy built into one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines, took interest in the Idaho bill early on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq00293b6qz5xqz8iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group promoted the bill as it sat on the governor’s desk, as he vetoed it, then as Manookian worked successfully to get a revived bill through the statehouse and signed into law.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002a3b6qz9wcowgz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization’s online video programming featured Manookian five times in late March and early April. One show’s host told viewers they could follow Idaho in its “very smart strategy” of taking a law against COVID-related mandates, “crossing out ‘COVID,’ making a few other tweaks, and you have an incredible health freedom bill after that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002b3b6qds4b5uu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children’s Health Defense CEO &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/mary-holland-j-d/" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Holland&lt;/a&gt; said she’s known Manookian for more than 15 years and pushed the national organization to publicize Manookian’s work. Holland introduced her at the Washington, D.C., event.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002c3b6qax4d8nbc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whereas most states put the onus on unvaccinated people to show why they should opt out of a mandate, Idaho’s legislation made unvaccinated people the norm — shifting the burden of accommodation onto those who support vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002d3b6q38a1ktxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, parents of infants too young for a measles vaccine can’t choose a daycare that requires immunization. Parents of immune-compromised students must decide whether to keep their children home from school during an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases, knowing unvaccinated children won’t be quarantined.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002e3b6q7otzr5gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements imposed by states like California and New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002f3b6qsxocitcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think you could certainly do that in Idaho.” Holland said. “It wouldn’t be a public school. It might be the Church of Vaccinia school.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The day Idaho’s Medical Freedom Act was signed, a legislator in Louisiana brought forward &lt;a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=25rs&amp;amp;b=HB555&amp;amp;sbi=y" target="_blank"&gt;the Louisiana Medical Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt;.

            Louisiana followed Idaho once before in 2024, when it &lt;a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=245567" target="_blank"&gt;passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that requires schools to describe the exemptions available to parents whenever they communicate about immunizations. Idaho had passed an almost identical law three years earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2895cp002n3b6qgn3gfqw2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Herricks, the Louisiana pro-vaccine advocate, said she watched the Idaho Medical Freedom Act’s progress with “a lot of concern, seeing how much progress it was making.” Now it’s set a precedent, Herricks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2893yk002k3b6qaeinf532@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland, the Children’s Health Defense CEO, said she looks forward to Idaho’s approach spreading.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002s3b6qkten8za6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She pointed to a September announcement by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo that he intends to rid his state of all vaccine mandates. Holland said she expects other Republican-controlled states to take a serious look at the Idaho law. (Ladapo’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002t3b6qv2o41jqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a big change,” Holland said. “It’s not just related to vaccines. It’s a blow against the notion that there can be compulsory medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some people support the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/requirements-research" target="_blank"&gt;more-than-century-old notion&lt;/a&gt; that compelling people to be vaccinated or masked will provide such enormous collective benefits that it outweighs any inconvenience or small incursion on personal liberty.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002v3b6q3t29t962@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others, like Holland and Manookian, do not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002w3b6q2dnr8gw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the heart of laws like Idaho’s is a sense of, “‘I’m going to do what I want to do for myself, and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do,’ which is in direct contrast to public health,” said Paul Offit, pediatrician and vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002x3b6qxv2l6vwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Offit, who co-invented a vaccine against rotavirus, is a critic of Kennedy and was removed from a federal vaccine panel in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002y3b6q5tbbtspl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A more fundamental conflict is that some people believe vaccines and other tools to prevent the spread of illness, like masks, are harmful. That belief is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of scientists and health experts, including Kennedy’s own &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015193709/https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/safety/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251012054453/https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Both tensions are at play in Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289esg002q3b6q6x6vgf5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As is the case nationally, Idaho’s “health freedom” movement has long pushed back against being labeled “anti-vaccine.” Idaho lawmakers and advocates have stressed that their goals are bodily autonomy and informed choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289rzc00343b6q9te14vww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They do not take a stance on the bodily autonomy principle when it comes to abortion, however. Almost all state legislators who voted for the Idaho Medical Freedom Act also voted to ban abortion, if they were in office at both times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289qpw00323b6q3zlvfqag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every action has to be evaluated on its individual morality,” not on whether it does the most good for the most people, Manookian said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr00393b6qbxnhd4rf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Manookian’s rejection of vaccine mandates goes beyond a libertarian philosophy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr003a3b6qxxei4978@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian has said publicly that she thinks vaccines are “poison for profit,” that continuing to let daycares require vaccination would “put our children on the chopping block,” that measles is “positive for the body,” that the virus protects against cancer, and that it can send people “into total remission” — an assertion she made on an Idaho wellness center’s podcast in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr003b3b6qz4ucta54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian told ProPublica she believes infectious diseases have been made “the bogeyman.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr003c3b6qvo8rzwt0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Against those claims, research has shown that having the measles &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;suppresses immunity to other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon dubbed &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;“immune amnesia”&lt;/a&gt; that can make children who have recovered from measles &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;more susceptible to pneumonia and other bacterial and viral infections&lt;/a&gt;. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected will die from complications of the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            And while researchers have studied using engineered measles viruses in a cancer treatment, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619619304628" target="_blank"&gt;those same researchers have written that&lt;/a&gt; they were “dismayed to learn” their research has been misconstrued by some who oppose vaccination. They said they “very strongly advise” giving children the measles vaccine, that there “is no evidence that measles infection can protect against cancer” and that measles is “a dangerous pathogen, not suitable for use as a cancer therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            (Manookian said she believes she has evidence for her cancer remission claim but couldn’t readily produce it, adding that she may have been mistaken.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, meanwhile, is safe and highly effective, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/infectious-disease/measles/know-the-facts" target="_blank"&gt;the Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The CDC says the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;most common negative reactions&lt;/a&gt; are a sore arm, fever or mild rash. Two doses of the vaccine provide near total protection, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Manookian said she doesn’t believe the research on vaccines has been adequate.

            She will have another chance to spread her views from a prominent platform in November, when she’s scheduled to speak at the &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-2025-conference/agenda/" target="_blank"&gt;Children’s Health Defense 2025 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, Texas.

            She’ll share the stage with celebrities in the anti-vaccine movement: Del Bigtree, communications director for Kennedy’s past presidential campaign; actor Russell Brand; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson; and Ladapo, the Florida surgeon general who made headlines for his push to end vaccine mandates in Florida, months after Idaho wrote that concept into law.

&lt;p&gt;How many steps do you need to reap health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/10/13/bjsports-2025-110311"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by investigators from Harvard and Mass General Brigham examined 13,547 older women, comparing their step counts over a one-week period against their mortality and cardiovascular disease rates over the next decade. The researchers found that achieving just 4,000 steps one or two days per week was associated with lower risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease — and with more steps came even greater benefits, up to a point when risk reductions leveled. The results were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-928eff49-67bc-47a0-8875-e207b6ab6726"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health benefits seem to be associated with the total volume of steps taken, rather than how many days per week a particular threshold was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In countries like the United States, advances in technology have made it such that we don’t really move very much, and older individuals are among those least active,” said senior author I-Min Lee, an epidemiologist at Mass General and at the Harvard Chan School. “Because of today’s low step counts, it’s increasingly important to determine the minimum amount of physical activity required to improve health outcomes, so that we can offer realistic and feasible goals for the public.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this federally funded study, researchers conducted a prospective cohort study of 13,574 older women (71.8 years old on average) without cardiovascular disease or cancer from the long-running &lt;a href="https://whs.bwh.harvard.edu/"&gt;Women’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;. The women wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers to track their steps over seven days between 2011 and 2015. For the next 10 years, the researchers monitored mortality and cardiovascular disease incidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were sorted by how many days per week they achieved step thresholds at or above 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, or 7,000. Those who got 4,000 steps one or two days per week had 26 percent lower mortality risk and 27 percent lower cardiovascular disease risk compared to those who never hit 4,000 on any day. What’s more, reaching 4,000 steps three or more days in a week decreased mortality risk further to 40 percent. As for women who reached the higher step thresholds, cardiovascular disease risk leveled out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the health benefits seem to be associated with the total volume of steps taken, rather than how many days per week a particular threshold was achieved. This suggests that there isn’t a “better” way to get steps — women with a similar total volume of steps, achieved either by consistent steps throughout the week or sporadic steps in just a few days, had similar health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to explore whether these effects hold in populations beyond older, mostly white women in the U.S. Additionally, the researchers are curious to analyze even lower step count thresholds to determine whether fewer than 4,000 steps can produce similar health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I hope our findings encourage the addition of step count metrics to physical activity guidelines, including the upcoming 2028 U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines,” said lead and corresponding author Rikuta Hamaya of Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “If we can promote taking at least 4,000 steps once per week in older women, we could reduce mortality and cardiovascular disease risk across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

These distinct models, which forecast different aspects of reality like context, people’s intentions, and potential actions, are then unified in a central hub to create our coherent, ongoing subjective experience. The research was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63522-y" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists behind the new study proposed that our world model is fragmented into at least three core domains. The first is a “State” model, which represents the abstract context or situation we are in. The second is an “Agent” model, which handles our understanding of other people, their beliefs, their goals, and their perspectives. The third is an “Action” model, which predicts the flow of events and possible paths through a situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a long-held tradition, and with good evidence that the mind is composed of many, different modules specialized for distinct computations. This is obvious in perception with modules dedicated to faces and places. This is not obvious in higher-order, more abstract domains which drives our subjective experience. The problem with this is non-trivial. If it does have multiple modules, how can we have our experience seemingly unified?” explained study author &lt;a href="https://fahd7yazin.github.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Fahd Yazin&lt;/a&gt;, a medical doctor who’s currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In learning theories, there are distinct computations needed to form what is called a world model. We need to infer from sensory observations what state we are in (context). For e.g. if you go to a coffee shop, the state is that you’re about to get a coffee. But if you find that the machine is out-of- order, then the current state is you’re not going to get it. Similarly, you need to have a frame of reference (frame) to put these states in. For instance, you want to go to the next shop but your friend had a bad experience there previously, you need to take their perspective (or frame) into account. You possibly had a plan of getting a coffee and chat, but now you’re willing to adapt a new plan (action transitions) of getting a matcha drink instead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re able to do all these things in a deceptively simple way because various modules can coordinate their output, or predictions together. And switch between various predictions effortlessly. So, if we disrupt their ongoing predictions in a natural and targeted way, you can get two things. The brain regions dedicated to these predictions, and how they influence our subjective experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the research team conducted a series of experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging, a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. In the main experiment, a group of 111 young adults watched an eight-minute suspenseful excerpt from an Alfred Hitchcock film, “Bang! You’re Dead!” while inside a scanner. They were given no specific instructions other than to watch the movie, allowing the scientists to observe brain activity during a naturalistic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand when participants’ predictions were being challenged and updated, the researchers collected data from separate groups of people who watched the same film online. These participants were asked to press a key whenever their understanding of the movie’s context (State), a character’s beliefs (Agent), or the likely course of events (Action) suddenly changed. By combining the responses from many individuals, the scientists created timelines showing the precise moments when each type of belief was most likely to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the brain scans from the movie-watching group, the scientists found a clear division of labor in the midline prefrontal cortex, a brain area associated with higher-level thought. When the online raters indicated a change in the movie’s context, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex became more active in the scanned participants. When a character’s perspective or intentions became clearer, the anteromedial prefrontal cortex showed more activity. And when the plot took a turn that changed the likely sequence of future events, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that these moments of belief updating corresponded to significant shifts in the brain’s underlying neural patterns. Using a computational method called a Hidden Markov Model, they identified moments when the stable patterns of activity in each prefrontal region abruptly transitioned. These neural transitions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex aligned closely with updates to “State” beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, transitions in the anteromedial prefrontal cortex coincided with “Agent” updates, and those in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex matched “Action” updates. This provides evidence that when our predictions about the world are proven wrong, it triggers not just a momentary spike in activity, but a more sustained shift in the neural processing of that specific brain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established that predictions are handled by separate modules, the researchers next sought to identify where these fragmented predictions come together. They focused on the precuneus, a region located toward the back of the brain that is known to be a major hub within the default mode network, a large-scale brain network involved in internal thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing the functional connectivity, or the degree to which different brain regions activate in sync, they found that during belief updates, each specialized prefrontal region showed increased communication with the precuneus. This suggests the precuneus acts as an integration center, receiving the updated information from each predictive module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further investigate this integration, the team examined the similarity of multivoxel activity patterns between brain regions. They discovered a dynamic process they call “multithreaded integration.” When participants’ beliefs about the movie’s context were being updated, the activity patterns in the precuneus became more similar to the patterns in the “State” region of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When beliefs about characters were changing, the precuneus’s patterns aligned more with the “Agent” region. This indicates that the precuneus flexibly syncs up with whichever predictive module is most relevant at a given moment, effectively weaving the separate threads of prediction into a single, coherent representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then connected this integration process to subjective experience. Using separate ratings of emotional arousal, a measure of how engaged and immersed viewers were in the film, they found that the activity of the precuneus closely tracked the emotional ups and downs of the movie. The individual prefrontal regions did not show this strong relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, individuals whose brains showed stronger integration between the prefrontal cortex and the precuneus also had more similar overall brain responses to the movie. This suggests that the way our brain integrates these fragmented predictions directly shapes our shared subjective reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At any given time, multiple predictions may compete or coexist, and our experience can shift depending on which predictions are integrated that best align with reality,” Yazin told PsyPost. “People whose brains make and integrate predictions in similar ways are likely to have more similar experiences, while differences in prediction patterns may explain why individuals perceive the same reality differently. This approach provides new insight into how shared realities and personal differences arise, offering a framework for understanding human cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm these findings were not specific to one movie or to visual information, the team replicated the key analyses using a different dataset where participants listened to a humorous spoken-word story. They found the same modular system in the prefrontal cortex and the same integrative role for the Precuneus, demonstrating that this is a general mechanism for how the brain models the world, regardless of the sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We replicated the main findings across a different cohort, sensory modality and emotional content (stimuli), making these findings robust to idiosyncratic factors,” Yazin said. “These results were observed when people were experiencing stimuli (movie/story) in a completely uninterrupted and uninstructed manner, meaning our experience is continuously rebuilt and adapted into a coherent unified stream despite it originating in a fragmented manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our experience is not just a simple passive product of our sensory reality. It is actively driven by our predictions. And these come in different flavors; about our contexts we find ourselves in, about other people and about our plans of the immediate future. Each of these gets updated as the sensory reality agrees (or disagrees) with our predictions. And integrates with that reality to form our ‘current’ experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have multiple such predictions internally, and at any given time our experience can toggle between these depending on how the reality fits them,” Yazin explained. “In other words, our original experience is a product of fragmented and distributed predictions integrated into a unified whole. And people with similar way of predicting and integrating, would have similar experiences from the reality than people who are dissimilar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More importantly, it brings the default mode network, a core network in the human brain into the table as a central network driving our core phenomenal experience. It’s widely implicated in learning, inference, imagination, memory recall and in dysfunctions to these. Our results offer a framework to fractionate this network by computations of its core components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, the study has some limitations. The analysis is correlational, meaning it shows associations between brain activity and belief updates but cannot definitively prove causation. Also, because the researchers used naturalistic stories, the different types of updates were not always completely independent; a single plot twist could sometimes cause a viewer to update their understanding of the context, a character, and the future plot all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the consistency of the findings across two very different naturalistic experiences provides strong support for a new model of human cognition. “Watching a suspenseful movie and listening to a comedic story feels like two very different experience but the fact that they have similar underlying regions with similar specialized processes for generating predictions was counterintuitive,” Yazin told PsyPost. “And that we could observe it in this data was something unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will use more controlled, artificially generated stimuli to better isolate the computations happening within each module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re currently exploring the nature of these computations in more depth,” Yazin said. “In naturalistic stimuli as we’ve used now, it is impossible to fully separate domains (the contributions of people and contexts are intertwined in such settings). It brings richness but you lose experimental control. Similarly, the fact that these prefrontal regions were sensitive regardless of content and sensory information means there is possibly an invariant computation going on within them. We’re currently investigating these using controlled stimuli and probabilistic models to answer these questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the last decade or so, there’s been two cultures in cognitive neuroscience,” he added. “One is using highly controlled stimuli, and leveraging stimulus properties to ascertain regional involvement to that function to various degrees. Second is using full-on naturalistic stimuli (movies, narratives, games) to understand how humans experience the world with more ecological accuracy. Each has brought unique and incomparable insights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We feel studies on subjective experience/phenomenal consciousness has focused more on the former because it is easier to control (perceptual features/changes), but there’s a rich tradition and methods in the latter school that may help uncover more intractable problems in novel ways. Episodic ,emory and semantic processing are two great examples of this, where using naturalistic stimuli opened up connections and findings that were completely new to each of those fields.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63522-y" target="_blank"&gt;Fragmentation and multithreading of experience in the default-mode network&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Fahd Yazin, Gargi Majumdar, Neil Bramley, and Paul Hoffman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:09:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQd3BTYmYwTy1fV2Q5RXM3RTQtUUtYRUJTZkZCSWdMam0tVWtJbXo3Y2E1S1Y5RG9XX3YzeXBwQjVoQVFOeFBDaUdwNTFsU2dDU3UyRC1QZU1KazlNc09DTFhiUTRFNWdqWjBYN0dfbHV5VFhLbklza3ltRThsRkR0Y016VnZLV0FCb05iTDhjZVR1dUNSczNPaHF6bnJJb013Sl8xZUZlRXlibEd0NER1VDVSSndPZw</guid></item><item><title>“不可挽回的损坏” ：前高级官员详细介绍了RFK Jr.领导下的疾控中心最黑暗的日子- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/irreparably-damaged-former-senior-official-details-the-darkest-days-of-the-cdc-under-rfk-jr-2000673201</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in a complete freefall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the reign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the longtime crank turned U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cdc-terminations-workforce-shutdown-rifs/"&gt;thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; have lost their jobs, the organization’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; have been hijacked by allies of the anti-vaccination movement, and workers there have endured a deadly shooting committed by a man whose motives were likely &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/08/17/im-gonna-shoot-up-cdc-patrick-joseph-whites-father-details-his-familys-horrors/"&gt;influenced by misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about the covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most dramatic upheaval &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;occurred&lt;/a&gt; in late August, when former CDC director Susan Monarez was fired just four weeks into taking the role. Monarez has since &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk"&gt;publicly testified&lt;/a&gt; that she was let go for refusing to sign off, without review, on the vaccine-related recommendations of RFK’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;handpicked advisors&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom—like Kennedy himself—have a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Immediately after Monarez’s reported firing, in a coordinated act of protest, three senior staff members at the CDC turned in their resignation notice: Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer, Daniel Jernigan, former director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (a fourth senior official, Jennifer Layden, former director of the CDC’s Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology, also resigned).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“We should practice detachment from the organizations and focus on the mission. And the mission is the health of the public.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gizmodo reached out to Daskalakis to discuss the events within the CDC leading up to the resignation, the fallout since, and what the path forward might look like in a world where trust in the CDC has eroded. The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Cara, Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you take us through the first days and weeks of the second Trump administration for you and others at the CDC? What was the general mood?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demetre Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; Soon after the election, when President Donald Trump announced that RFK Jr. was going to be his candidate for the Secretary of Health and Human Services—that was obviously the beginning red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prior to the CDC, I had worked in New York City for many years in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. While there, I had been involved as the incident commander over the measles outbreak from 2018 to 2019. And that’s the first time that I had any awareness of the sort of anti-vaccine strategies of RFK Jr. and the organizations he participated in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So while we were running the measles response, one of his organizations, Children’s Health Defense, was working to undermine the work we were doing. It supported anti-vaccine messaging, and RFK Jr. would go on to &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2019/07/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr-sues-new-york-in-attempt-to-stop-state-from-outlawing-religious-exemptions-to-vaccinations/"&gt;sue the health department&lt;/a&gt; while we were in the middle of our response, trying to destabilize what we were doing. At that point, I was like, “There’s this kooky guy who’s a Kennedy who is really trying to interfere with this important work to prevent kids from getting sick.” So when they said his name as the candidate, I was like, “Oh boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: Kennedy founded Children’s Health Defense and served as its chairman and chief litigation counsel before resigning ahead of his failed presidential run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then I did research on it, and not just me, all the doctors at CDC who were in leadership. We all read books, we looked at papers, to figure out what we were up for. And also to see where there were opportunities for us to integrate our sort of science and strategy in public health with what will be the vision of the new secretary. It’s what you do as a civil servant: How do I work with the new leadership and still make sure that we’re protecting the health of the country?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before he was appointed, though, there were the confirmation hearings. Ahead of those hearings, his cousin [Carolyn Kennedy] &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5278407/caroline-kennedy-rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing"&gt;came out&lt;/a&gt;, called him a predator and said that he was dangerous for American health. So that was something. And watching the hearings, I was not particularly impressed. He seemed not very well prepared, but that’s probably less his problem and more his teams. But we made it through that and then he got confirmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next thing that I did was, when he gave his &lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/rfk-jr-delivers-welcoming-remarks-to-hhs-staff"&gt;big talk&lt;/a&gt; at HHS after he was sworn in, I made my whole team stop doing work so they could hear what he had to say. And honestly, it was good. He said gold standard science and radical transparency are things that he was going to uphold. And he made it seem like he was going to engage with the scientists and the experts across HHS to make sure that we’re going down the right scientific path. So we took copious notes, and we felt like we could do it—we’re going to figure out how to work with this guy. We prepared all these transition documents, all these plans, all these things to be ready to talk to him.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Then what happened?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; Then he landed and we never, ever heard from him. We reached out to try to brief him. He never said yes. We talked to his teams. They never said yes. And the communications we were getting were some combination of dismantling CDC and doing really unhinged policy things. Around February 14th, we had our &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge"&gt;first CDC massacre&lt;/a&gt; where they fired a bunch of people who were newly hired staff. April 1st, we had our &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/01/g-s1-57485/hhs-fda-layoffs-doge-cdc-nih"&gt;next CDC massacre&lt;/a&gt; where they literally deleted thousands of positions from CDC. And then just now, we had our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/cdc-job-cuts-partial-reversal"&gt;third CDC massacre&lt;/a&gt;. We’re now about a quarter down of the staff that we had in CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“There’s no need to destroy public health to rebuild it.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there’s all the policy things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He changed the covid-19 vaccine recommendations for kids and pregnant women via a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; [in late May]. We had heard nothing about it before that. He had never conferred with any scientists. When we asked him if we could get the documents underlying the data that support your decision, his staff said no. So CDC was directed to make changes and no one had ever seen the data underneath it. So we made it; we tried to mitigate that and made it a little bit not as bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then fired all of the experts on the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is the body responsible for guiding CDC on what they should do for vaccine policy. And he replaced them mostly with people who were, frankly, political appointees who were ideologically aligned to his desire to dismantle and destroy vaccines. They’ve changed the way that the committee works. The entire agenda, the entire membership, all of the conversations are only driven by these people that he put in who are his ideological clones and the scientists are completely sidelined, only being able to provide data as requested rather than really engaging in the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And then, of course, Susan Monarez was fired. There was this brief shining moment when we had a scientific leader who was going to help be a diplomat to build the bridge between us and the secretary. And then he basically told her that he didn’t want her science here; he just wanted her to sign off on these recommendations. And they fired her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;So the Monarez firing was the breaking point that led you and your senior colleagues to resign in protest?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s what led all of us to get together, and for me to say that it was time to go, because I can’t support something that’s not going to use good science, something that will potentially end up making terrible decisions for the country that could impact the health of people.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But we had all been writing our resignation letters. I started my resignation letter when he fired ACIP because I was like, “I just need to have all this documentation for the moment when I have to get out of here, because I can’t do any good anymore.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. was dictating things in a way that wouldn’t let science get done or be reviewed adequately. But then I was very excited when Susan came aboard, when she had this moment of like, let’s try to work with this and make it better. She had a vision for how to do it. And he just threw it aside. She was like a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-secretary-kennedy-swears-in-susan-monarez-as-cdc-director-to-advance-make-america-healthy-again.html#:~:text=%22Dr.%20Monarez%20is,and%20biosecurity%20threats.%22"&gt;trusted expert&lt;/a&gt; two months before, and now she’s absolutely a demon. So when we lost that scientific leadership, it was the end.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“These are a bunch of rookies that don’t know even how to run a medium-sized organization, much less one that’s complex like CDC.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bottom line, their office of the director at CDC only had one person other than Susan who was a scientist, and that was Debra Houry. So when that conversation began and she said she was also going to leave, that was the end of that. It’s like having a head and body but with no neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you say to the critiques made by RFK Jr. and his allies that all this chaos is needed? That the only way to “Make America Healthy Again,” as his saying goes, is to dismantle the status quo of the CDC and the country’s public health systems in general?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; I call bullshit on it. It’s garbage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no need to destroy public health to rebuild it. There is a rational way to do it. The CDC, especially since covid, has changed a lot. Could it change more? Yes, but do you do it by destroying CDC? That’s like flying a plane holding hundreds of people, thinking that the engine’s not so great, and trying to rebuild the engine while it’s flying. Even worse, it’s like blowing up a plane while it’s flying and hoping all the parts will land somewhere safe and the people will be fine. It’s beyond irrational.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tearing the CDC apart while saying that you’re going to make it better also means that we’re completely not prepared in the event that something disastrous happens. And frankly, we’re not really prepared for the routine work either, because it’s like an interconnected organism. We had already made proposals on how to make the CDC more efficient and how to do it quickly. But they wouldn’t take them. Instead, they’re taking this tech bro strategy of, “Let’s break it and then see how it goes.” And you don’t want your public health done that way.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;How has the CDC been doing since your resignation, in your opinion?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s just getting worse, and they still don’t have any scientific leadership. The guy who they claim is the acting director of CDC, Jim O’Neill, has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/29/politics/jim-oneill-cdc-vaccine-meetings#:~:text=O%E2%80%99Neill%20has%20had%20little%20discernible%20interaction%20with%20the%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20rank%20and%20file%20since%20joining%20the%20administration%20in%20June%2C%20the%20people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter%20said."&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/10/the-cdcs-weekend-of-whiplash/684549/"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with the senior leadership at CDC—it’s now been about five weeks since he was appointed. And yet he feels comfortable, as a non-scientist, tweeting out things about &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1975208317850116544"&gt;separating&lt;/a&gt; the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1971675338918023441"&gt;congratulating themselves&lt;/a&gt; for taking down websites that are important for people’s health because they have the word “equity” or talk about gender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this latest reduction in force, it’s disastrous, even if some of those firings have been reversed. Right now, the CDC doesn’t have an &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/13/trump-kennedy-cdc-firings-rehirings#:~:text=ethics%20office%20that%20reviews%20conflicts%20of%20interest"&gt;ethics office&lt;/a&gt;; they don’t have an &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/whiplash-cdc-hundreds-employees-are-terminated-then-reinstated#:~:text=Staff%20with%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20institutional%20review%20board%2C%20which%20reviews%20the%20design%20of%20studies%20involving%20human%20subjects%2C%20were%20also%20let%20go"&gt;institutional review board;&lt;/a&gt; and they don’t have the organization that looks after the advisory committees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: Some of the employees fired in this latest round were responsible for overseeing conflicts of interests in these committees, while the Trump administration has previously &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/healthcare-associated-infections/trump-administration-shuts-down-federal-advisory-committee"&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; several advisory committees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s supposed to be radical transparency, but they can’t communicate because they got rid of all their communicators. They can’t run a advisory committee because they got rid of the advisory committee groups. And they can’t review science to be able to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;What about those still left behind at the CDC? How have they been faring through all this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis: &lt;/strong&gt;The staff is horribly traumatized. Two months ago, that place was shot with 500 bullets. My office has a giant hole in the window because of a bullet. And RFK Jr. came down, said thoughts and prayers, and then immediately went to an interview and said not to trust experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: During an August 11 interview three days after the shooting, RFK &lt;a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/rfk-jr-in-interview-with-scripps-news-trusting-the-experts-is-not-science"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;, “Trusting the experts is not a feature of either science or democracy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one seems to cares. When an ICE facility got shot up last month, the president ten minutes later had a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552278/trump-blames-dallas-ice-shooting-on-radical-leftists"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about it. He has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/15/trump-cdc-police-officer-silence/"&gt;never said one word&lt;/a&gt; about the shooting at CDC; not one word about the police officer who died to protect us. So they do not value the workers, they do not value the work. For them, dismantling the CDC is no big deal and, frankly, it’s because they don’t understand the value that public health gives to the country and the world. Because these are a bunch of rookies that don’t know even how to run a medium-sized organization, much less one that’s complex like CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Circling back a bit, it seems like breaking up the MMR vaccine—something that both acting CDC director O’Neill and President Trump have called for—would be the most dramatic change in vaccine policy seen yet. Just how realistic are the odds of that happening?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; A year ago, I would have said it’s totally not possible. First of all, there’s no separate measles vaccine that’s produced and available in the U.S., and there’s no such thing as a separate mumps and rubella vaccine, either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these people don’t follow any sort of political norms. And as we’ve seen with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-and-rfk-jr-blame-tylenol-for-autism-in-new-report-but-experts-push-back-2000662054#:~:text=This%20cautionary%20tale,of%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mandell%20said."&gt;leucovorin&lt;/a&gt;, the drug that they approved for autism, they also don’t follow any sort of standard regulatory pathways. So I can’t predict if they’re going to do it. I don’t put anything past this administration’s ability to circumvent science and process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Remarkably, we’re not even a full year into this second term. Given how dire the CDC’s situation is right now, what’s to be done, in your opinion? Is there a way to navigate ourselves out of this catastrophe in the making?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a complicated question, but I have a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now, looking at CDC, it is pretty irreparably damaged. We can criticize the pandemic response, but CDC did a lot of important functions and did actually function very well for most of what it was doing. Post-pandemic, there were many changes to CDC, related to what the experience was during the pandemic. But now, with a quarter of the staff gone, with no strategic plan around why they’re gone, it’s all just patchwork. What CDC is like now is a smartphone with all of its apps but no operating system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my simple answer is that federal public health has now been compromised—it has been taken over by ideology, it’s been weaponized. If you look at the CDC website, the “About” webpage is literally &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-republicans-trump-administration-hud"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; around extremely partisan views. My advice to the world is that we should practice detachment from the organizations and focus on the mission. And the mission is the health of the public. And so I think that focusing a lot of energy in trying to repair CDC is actually the wrong direction, because that damage has been done. And for me, the bottom line isn’t just that there’s no political will to fix it, it’s the opposite—there’s a strong political will to break it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing that we’re going to be able to do at this moment to resist the breaking of CDC. But what we can do is turn to local jurisdictions, states, and other professional organizations outside the federal government. They’re going to have to be the renaissance that will follow after the dark ages. I don’t know what that renaissance will look like, but I know it’s not going to come from the feds down. It’s going to come from the states, the jurisdictions, the organizations, and the people on the ground. Because there will be something that can be rebuilt or built up, but it’s not going to be out of the minds of the people who are literally trying to destroy public health.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

As a 2021 review of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/9/1/26/5998648?login=true" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;fever in the Covid-19 pandemic era&lt;/a&gt; put it: "blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defence against infection".   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Using medication to quell the impacts of fever can also have adverse effects at a population level. A 2014 study, for example, found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2570" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;suppressing fevers caused by the flu can lead to higher transmission rates&lt;/a&gt;. That's because if infected people simply treat their feverish symptoms, they soon resume their everyday activities, from work to socialising, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2570" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;spreading the disease further than if they felt the need to rest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the case of mild fevers, it's therefore better in some circumstances to let them do their job, says Perretti. Theoretically, he says, one could give the body 24 to 48 hours to perform the necessary inflammatory response. However, he warns, this could still be dangerous in some situations, so you should always consult your clinician, who can identify the best course of treatment for your specific scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Scientists are still working out when to treat fevers, and when to leave them alone. But the next time you have one, as the sweat drips from your body and the shivering sets in, take the opportunity to marvel at your immune system's efforts to protect you from further harm. It's been millennia in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="*-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-physician-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;* All content within this column is provided for general information only and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

                A new study found the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the U.S., called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, tended to have fewer side effects than some older medications.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that antidepressants come with side effects for cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a major analysis from a team of researchers in the U.K. has, for the first time, pulled together data from more than 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of dozens of antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study,&lt;a href="https://info.thelancet.com/hubfs/Press%20embargo/Antidepressantsmeta.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;the Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this week, details how each medication can affect weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol and other areas of health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The end result is something akin to a "sports league table" for 30 different antidepressants based on their side effect profile, says lead author &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/toby-pillinger" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Toby Pillinger&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist at King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's never been done at this scale before and no one's ever put specific numbers to the amount of weight you'll put on, or to the amount that your cholesterol goes up," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings are based on existing data, mostly from 8-week drug studies, that altogether represent more than 58,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the U.S. — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5504044/ssri-antidepressant-withdrawal-side-effects" target="_blank"&gt;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" target="_blank"&gt;SSRIs, like Zoloft and Prozac &lt;/a&gt;— tended to have fewer physical side effects, according to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other medications, particularly some of the older drugs, were shown to have more significant impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a person who took nortriptyline, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046983" target="_blank"&gt;a tricyclic antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;, could, on average, have an increase in heart rate that was 20 beats higher than the SSRI fluvoxamine. For other medications, the expected weight change could be four pounds gained, or lost.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pillinger says the intention is not to single out certain antidepressants as better than others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It may be that one medication which is pretty bad for one person actually is pretty good for another one. I think that is the message, rather than naming and shaming certain drugs," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pillinger hopes the data can help prescribers and their patients make individualized decisions about the best medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, he and his colleagues have created&lt;a href="https://www.psymatik.com/" target="_blank"&gt; a free digital tool &lt;/a&gt;that's already being used by clinicians all over the world to create a "menu" of options, based on a patient's underlying health and what side effects they'd most like to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/departments/psychiatry-and-behavioral-health/education/research-residency-track/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nina Kraguljac&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Ohio State University, who was not involved in the research, says the study was well-done — and largely reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What surprised me about this study is that side effects are not that severe," says Kraguljac, who is also chair of the American Psychiatric Association's council on research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, she stresses that "side effects alone should not guide a clinical decision," since the study's results ultimately reflect an average, not the individual patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Side effects do not happen in every patient and are not necessarily a reason to deter people from taking the medications," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study does have some notable limitations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though many people take these drugs for months or years, the data was largely from 8-week randomized controlled trials, which are the most common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And some prominent side effects — that cause some people to stop taking antidepressants — were not evaluated, says &lt;a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/david-j-hellerstein-md" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Hellerstein&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He points out the impact on sexual function, gastrointestinal issues, and "emotional blunting" — a sense that feelings are being muted — are all common complaints that weren't looked at.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Most of the side effects detailed in the study are already well-known, although he believes the work will still be "a useful touchstone" for patients and prescribers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Big picture, most of these drugs seem quite safe on a lot of physical parameters, especially the newer drugs, like the SSRIs and SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But for some groups of people, the side effects might be significant, he cautions, "and could affect what medicine the doctor would choose or what medicine a patient would prefer."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And he notes, side effects aren't always a downside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hellerstein has a patient who had lost a significant amount of weight due to depression, meaning an antidepressant that also led to some extra weight would actually be "healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say that is not a side effect. That is a benefit of treatment," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The United Nations health agency has set a goal of &lt;a href="/news/2021/11/4/hpv-jabs-reduce-cervical-cancer-risk-by-up-to-87-percent-study"&gt;eradicating cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; globally by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-hpv-and-what-are-the-symptoms"&gt;What is HPV and what are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-hpv-cause-cervical-cancer"&gt;How does HPV cause cervical cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-have-vaccines-been-rolled-out-in-pakistan"&gt;How have vaccines been rolled out in Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_4054542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4054542" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4054542" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap_68f9d3885bba6-1761203080.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="A health worker gives an injection of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to a girl during a campaign aiming to protect girls from cervical cancer, at a school in Lahore, Pakistan, Monday, Sept. 22, 2025.

Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-cecolin"&gt;What is Cecolin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-the-vaccine-only-being-given-to-girls-aged-nine-to-14"&gt;Why is the vaccine only being given to girls aged nine to 14?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-recipients-of-the-vaccine-say-about-it"&gt;What do recipients of the vaccine say about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-successful-has-the-vaccination-drive-been-so-far"&gt;How successful has the vaccination drive been so far?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-others-get-the-vaccine"&gt;Will others get the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-driving-vaccine-hesitancy-in-pakistan"&gt;What is driving vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-specific-concerns-about-the-hpv-vaccine"&gt;What are the specific concerns about the HPV vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World Population Review&lt;/a&gt;, 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While &lt;a href="/features/2024/10/13/choosing-to-be-child-free-in-an-apocalyptic-south-asia"&gt;birthrates&lt;/a&gt; in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-the-hpv-vaccine-safe"&gt;Is the HPV vaccine safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 08:16:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPSzFfUXZzbFI2bTUwdWMtSi15YmhEMkp2QUVsdVk3YUNWSTRtcy1tZGZicUxhMzQzbXRZbVVYM3o3cWd5TEdJQ3V6aU00amlkNmc5bGVhMXdmdTlPek1wSkJwcVEzbms0THl6ck5lMmhObXYySWJmcXFqcFE0aVNQdzF0VXVrbHQtcUY5OEJ2MkdtQzIydmFUWkJ6bzFLQdIBowFBVV95cUxNdmROd0dNcnV5SHpTeXpxbnhMemdMYUotXzJEY19heUlKSnZmZnM0a25uaEF5ZWp4RDdyZkp0WW9UWm1yTHctQ2hQdG5EMFZBVFZYOWhkZmg5a0ozWmkxZWRxVnhYYWtzcXlYWVpGSndjN2E2d0g0WmpkVnpramEwc0RyVTlMNjlGdmNCRFBiVlZDWV9JdDZxM20wNEFRMVdiTE84</guid></item><item><title>针对35岁以上成年人的4种癌症筛查测试：预防和早期诊断-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/4-cancer-screening-tests-for-adults-over-35-prevention-and-early-diagnosis/photostory/124754492.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular screening tests are the backbone of early cancer detection. The established tests are all well proven, extensively studied, and supported by international cancer experts and organizations. Among the most successful instances is the colonoscopy, which is advised for adults from age 45 and above, and usually repeated after every ten years. The test screens for colon cancer and even detects precancerous polyps before they become malignant.&lt;br&gt;For the early detection of breast cancer, mammograms are being recommended starting at the age of 40 years and then a follow-up is usually due every one to two years, depending upon the professional's suggestion&lt;br&gt; This non-invasive imaging study can detect tumors before they can be felt or cause symptoms, greatly reducing cure and survival rates through early treatment.&lt;br&gt;In the same manner, screening for cervical cancer via pap smears (alone or in combination with an HPV test) is a critical regimen for women at age 21 and above, Dr. Vassily advises. Periodic screening can reveal pre-cancerous cervical cell changes, enabling treatment before cancer arises. For males, the PSA test is an early indicator of prostate cancer risk, especially for those with increased familial risk factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 06:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>营养师希望您多吃这种蔬菜，以获得更好的新陈代谢健康- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vegetable-for-metabolic-health-11834965</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cabbage delivers &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;key nutrients that help protect your heart&lt;/a&gt;. Potassium supports healthy blood pressure, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin K plays an essential role&lt;/a&gt; in blood clotting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Red cabbage is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-anthocyanins-11727484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;rich in anthocyanins&lt;/a&gt;—the same pigments found in berries—that have been linked to lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Science backs this up. “A [review study] found that eating at least 100 grams of leafy green vegetables per day was associated with a 25% lower risk of death, heart disease and stroke,” Gaw tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research also suggests that antioxidants like glucosinolates and polyphenols found in cabbage can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation and oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; in blood vessels, which supports healthier arteries and better circulation over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Regular Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;Consistent physical activity supports good metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If you don’t have time for a 30-minute walk, try two to three 10- to 15-minute walks throughout the day,” Gaw suggests. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; “Poor sleep can throw off hunger hormones and increase cortisol, making it harder to manage cravings and energy,” says Colin. Experts recommend getting about seven to eight hours of quality sleep to protect against metabolic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Plants:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond cabbage, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-packed-foods-11813913" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost fiber and antioxidant intake&lt;/a&gt; by eating a variety of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can negatively impact metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Small habits like walking outside, deep breathing or gentle stretching can make a difference,” Leverich explains. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Good metabolic health plays a vital role in healthy aging, and the foods you eat most often matter. Cabbage is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-food-to-eat-more-11803017" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant-rich vegetable&lt;/a&gt; that has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vegetables-for-metabolic-syndrome-11787599" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;support many aspects of metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. But don’t worry if you’re not a fan of cabbage—research shows &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vegetable-for-longevity-11791598" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;similar benefits for other leafy green vegetables&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree the greatest impact comes from consistency. Making vegetables a regular part of your meals, alongside other healthy habits—moving your body, getting quality sleep and managing stress—can go a long way in protecting your metabolic health.&lt;br&gt;

rectally – one of the winners of the 2024 “Ig Nobel” satirical science prize – may one day actually help &lt;a href="/news/health/copd-ild-treatment-lung-disease-singing-benefits-b2835257.html"&gt;lung disease patients&lt;/a&gt;, after achieving a key step in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique was first demonstrated in 2021 by Japanese researchers, who showed in experimental &lt;a href="/news/science/pig-lungs-human-transplant-surgery-china-b2813923.html"&gt;pig models&lt;/a&gt; that oxygen could be delivered to the body via the rectum in gas form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enema-like process delivers &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://indy-cms-new-prod.brightsites.co.uk/article/edit/2849950"&gt;super-oxygenated liquid&lt;/a&gt; to the large intestine where the life-supporting gas is absorbed into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this method of rescuing people with blocked airways led the research team to win a parody award, it might not be a joke after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt; reports encouraging data from the first human clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits of this “enteral ventilation” technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” Takanori Takebe, an author of the study from the University of Osaka, said. “Now that we’ve established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Efficacy of anal breathing method examined in mammals such as mice and pigs&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Institute of Science Tokyo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the low-tech experimental technique were to prove successful in ongoing human trials, it could allow doctors to rescue people with airways blocked by injury or inflammation or with lung function severely limited by infectious diseases, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese scientists had got inspiration for the technique from observing the loach, a bottom-feeding fish known to swallow air from the surface and absorb oxygen through its gut, supplementing intake through the gills to survive in low-oxygen conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had also been inspired by the invention of the chemical perfluorocarbon liquid, or Oxycyte, which was developed as a potential form of artificial blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study assessed data from 27 healthy men in Japan who were asked to hold varying amounts of the &lt;a href="/news/science/into-the-abyss-the-diving-suit-that-turns-men-into-fish-2139167.html"&gt;perfluorocarbon liquid&lt;/a&gt; – without it being oxygenated – for 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study evaluated the safety of this method in humans for the first time, using a special liquid called perfluorodecalin with exceptional oxygen-carrying ability,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 20 of them held the liquid for the entire hour, including amounts up to 1,500 ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the largest volumes, though, the participants reported feeling abdominal bloating and discomfort, but no serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a trial with 27 healthy male volunteers, the authors found that administering this liquid rectally was safe and well tolerated,” the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were hoping to repeat the experiment using oxygenated liquid to measure how much of it was needed and for how long to improve blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important safety milestone,” they concluded, “paves the way for future studies to see if this technique can help patients with respiratory failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSjRuelJUQmxJLVRuMFRMRGhPOFVfNEJyQ2RNZGhRNnNCcWtYWk5zVGhBN1hEdWQ0NUZJSVl4QW9WcktaX1dqbmFPMl83bjVvS3dfa1ppRi04SnNfUGhWQi1UTnUtVnVobDE5SkQyLU1HTEwwM3QtZndPeHRTSU9wcVZpVjJCREFmbW0tQ0psRHJ5a2ljbVBOZ1JuaDJHYWZyN1FR</guid></item></channel></rss>
