                The U.S. has marked World AIDS Day — the first global day dedicated to a health issue — since its creation in 1988. From left: President Joe Biden delivers remarks at a World AIDS Day event on the South Lawn at the White House on December 1, 2024. President George W. Bush with First Lady Laura Bush commemorate World AIDS Day on December 1, 2008 on the North Lawn of the White House.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The State Department issued a terse statement last week saying, "an awareness day is not a strategy." The result is that on December 1, the United States is not commemorating World AIDS Day. It's the first time the U.S. has not participated since the World Health Organization created this day in 1988 to remember the &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_FactSheet_en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;millions of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who have died of AIDS-related illnesses and recommit to fighting the epidemic that still claims the lives of more than half a million people each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By contrast, last year former President Joe Biden held a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House with the &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmemorial.org/quilt-history" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIDS Memorial Quilt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — with coffin-shaped patches each honoring someone who had died of AIDS-related causes — spread out on the grass. And this year, despite the Trump administration's change of heart, countries around the world are marking the day with proclamations, public health campaigns and commemorative ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then and now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Trump has nothing planned for this year and the State Department has instructed employees not to mark the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, confirmed the decision not to commemorate the day, writing in a statement that the country is "modernizing our approach to countering infectious diseases" and that "under the leadership of President Trump, the State Department is working directly with foreign governments to save lives and increase their responsibility and burden sharing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some HIV/AIDS activists reacted with frustration to the news — and with protests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's emblematic of an administration that doesn't seem to care," said &lt;a href="https://avac.org/mitchell-warren/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mitchell Warren&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of AVAC, a global HIV prevention organization based in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has consistently been the top financial supporter of the global fight against HIV/AIDS, primarily through President George W. Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has invested more than &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$110 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into the global effort since it launched in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, since the start of President Trump's second term, almost a year ago, his administration has made major cuts to global health spending and programing as it champions an America First approach and emphasizes countries being weaned off aid. This has disrupted HIV/AID care in many parts of the world — including making it challenging for some HIV-positive individuals to get their medication in places such as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/14/g-s1-59863/hiv-aids-drugs-usaid-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zambia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Kenya, according to UNAIDS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Is this a symbolic act? Yes, it is and it symbolizes something that is actually devastating and chaotic," says Warren.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is not alone in reducing international aid, as other countries – including France, Germany and the United Kingdom — have scaled back on foreign assistance as they shift priorities. The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/november/wad-2025-report" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UNAIDS report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for World AIDS Day this year warned of "ruinous consequences."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Protesters gathered outside the White House on Monday, demanding that funding be restored. Asia Russell – executive director of Health GAP, a global HIV advocacy organization – was one of them. She says the decision not to mark the day was reminiscent of the early days of the HIV/AIDS fight when the disease was highly stigmatized and overlooked as a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent years, medical advances have meant there's been progress in the combatting new HIV/AIDS injection and getting those who are already infected on treatment. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So what's missing is political will, and that lack of political will was on devastating display when the White House announced that it would ban commemoration of this pandemic. It's truly depraved and outrageous," Russell says, adding that there were about 100 other people at the protest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The decision not to mark World AIDS Day is in line with the administration's broader approach to WHO and the United Nations more broadly. Trump has been critical of multilateral organizations like the U.N. and of WHO's handling of COVID. One of his first moves, on inauguration day, was to start the process of &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;removing the U.S. from the WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Trump Administration has marked other days designated by the UN, such as World Autism Awareness Day. The White House issued a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/world-autism-awareness-day-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;proclamation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;World AIDS Day "only exists on the calendar because of pressure from people with HIV and their communities fighting back against stigma," Russell says. "A commemorative day, as minor as that might sound, is actually life-saving work to chip away at that deadly stigma."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But while eligible adults generally should get them, pregnant women should not use them, the WHO stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Limits on global production capacity mean that now only at most about 100 million people could receive the drugs – only 10% of the 1 billion who could benefit. The number of people deemed obese – based on a body mass index of 30 or more – is due to double from 1 billion to 2 billion by 2030, and the costs worldwide to hit $3tn by the same date, it warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also warned that pharmaceutical companies would have to lower the prices they charge for Mounjaro, Ozempic and similar drugs and hugely expand production of them to avoid people in the world’s poorer countries being denied them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“While medication alone won’t solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO set out its thinking on the drugs for the first time in a “special communication” aimed at health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“GLP-1 therapies mark more than a scientific breakthrough. They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity – from a ‘lifestyle condition’ to a complex, preventable and treatable chronic disease,” its statement in the Journal of the American Medical Association said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“GLP-1 therapies … have emerged as an important innovation in addressing the global obesity challenge. The advent of these medications represents a tipping point in the treatment of obesity, its complications and related co-morbidities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO’s statement was written by three leading doctors: Francesca Celletti, Luz De Regil and Jeremy Farrar, its assistant director for health promotion and disease prevention and control, who was previously its chief scientist and also the director of the Wellcome scientific institute in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It stressed that the drugs on their own were not enough to reverse obesity and that people using them should also eat more healthily, exercise more and have counselling about their lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO accepts the growing evidence that GLP-1s can help reduce the risk of a range of serious and potentially fatal events and conditions including heart attacks and strokes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, bad cholesterol, sleep apnoea and kidney and arterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Three “major barriers” must be overcome to ensure that everyone globally whose health would benefit from GLP-1s can get them: lack of production capacity, availability and affordability; health systems’ preparedness to provide them; and universal access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Weight loss drugs have an important role to play, but they are not a silver bullet,” said Katherine Jenner, the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 health, medical and children’s organisations in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the UK right now, access is still limited, supply is fragile, and NHS use is tightly targeted. These powerful medicines can help individuals with chronic obesity, but they are not suitable for everyone and must be accompanied by comprehensive support to be used safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Evidence shows that most people regain weight once they stop taking these drugs, and we cannot medicate two-thirds of the population indefinitely”, added Jenner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOUTJrWnRhZEVEMHZuS3lqSkM3eXZaM0h0UC1YUnFXVWQyVWg2NGxuRjV3WGxLeUo5OGhRRTM0cG5abHlGUERpT1pLSG1Va1o5X3laRnhOQ2YzMGwzaTNRZE9vSDlJV3BEVmRuZXA2Y0poelZrNUl2REw1U2hnbDJES29BNnB0ZDdZNjZzR0tFbWZYdVdtdjlCaks4N09GRWtzX1JlVDBqLTNOVUV4QjRPdDBja2lNQQ</guid></item><item><title>疫苗委员会主席辞去新HHS工作-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-martin-kulldorff-vaccines-a1f8135eb1360be0dbf407f3d316ab80</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial vaccine advisory committee will be meeting later this week under a new chairperson, federal officials announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy has remade the committee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee makes recommendations to the director of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-director-susan-monarez-50dfbec849b53b4593755d2e6e616687"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee’s recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replaced it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Kulldorff’s leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/thimerosal-mercury-vaccine-preservative-7626ec1455ad98228cf8b041f6388bab"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the group recommended &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-acip-hepatitis-b-chickenpox-21623ff8ead38ae1b21db488ee82a1f8"&gt;new restrictions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-advisers-vaccines-hepatitis-b-covid19-a1fb61ef7e29d93d2828618d890cceb3"&gt;unprecedented step&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations — not even for high-risk populations like seniors — instead making it a matter of personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several doctors’ groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-vaccines-aap-cdc-33896013e1d7b3ad06dbd0d99d300bff"&gt;follow guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that was previously in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Kulldorff is moving to an HHS role &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff’s departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;traditional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “evidence-to-recommendation” framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department’s “in-house think tank.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to contributing to the science-based public health policies that will Make America Healthy Again,” Kulldorff said in the HHS press release.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Committee is expected to vote on hepatitis shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday in Atlanta, with a vote expected on whether to change the recommendation on shots for newborns against hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s unclear exactly what the committee plans to vote on. HHS officials have not responded to repeated questions seeking details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current recommendations call for a first dose to be given to newborns within 24 hours of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, 15 state governors submitted public comments suggesting the committee was hurting public trust in vaccines and the ability of people to get affordable shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But the virus can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections that can lead to a lifetime of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccinations are considered a success, and experts say no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in September, Kennedy’s ACIP members discussed whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination — something doctors and parents already can choose to do. The panel pulled back from taking a vote amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

It has &lt;a href="https://www.americangene.com/blog/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-find-an-hiv-cure/"&gt;a few strategies&lt;/a&gt; that make it extremely difficult to treat, including rapid mutation and an ability to &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/drug-resistance"&gt;evolve drug resistance&lt;/a&gt; if therapy isn't maintained perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183528" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-micrograph.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183528" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-micrograph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-micrograph-600x446.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183528" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;3D-printed model of an HIV particle (right) next to a colored micrograph image of an infected cell. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HIV_Virus_-_2.jpg"&gt;NIAID/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV exploits a receptor called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.296.7.815"&gt;CCR5&lt;/a&gt; to attach to and enter the host's cells. Once inside, it buries its DNA in the genome. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hivs-cunning-strategy-for-hiding-in-our-body-finally-revealed"&gt;remain dormant within&lt;/a&gt; some long-lived immune cells for years, creating a &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/what-latent-hiv-reservoir"&gt;latent reservoir&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reservoirs of HIV are essentially invisible to the immune system and untouched by antiretroviral therapy (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/antiretroviral-therapy"&gt;ART&lt;/a&gt;), the drugs that stop HIV from replicating. If a patient stops taking regular doses of ART, any remaining virus hiding in that reservoir can re-emerge and reignite the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full stem cell transplants uniquely primed to circumvent these strategies have had a proven record in depleting these reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the patient undergoes an aggressive course of chemotherapy to wipe out most of their immune system, including a significant number of the cells containing hidden copies of the HIV genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a transplant of donor stem cells rebuilds the immune system from scratch. Those new cells can recognize the few remaining HIV hideouts and wipe them out through a phenomenon known as a graft-versus-reservoir response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five of the seven known cases of long-term HIV remission –  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-first-person-to-be-cured-of-hiv-has-passed-away-from-cancer"&gt;the Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv-cured-london-man-still-has-no-trace-of-infection-nearly-3-years-after-treatment"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/another-person-has-been-cured-of-hiv-almost-a-decade-after-treatment"&gt;Duesseldorf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-us-woman-could-be-the-third-person-cured-of-hiv-this-time-using-umbilical-blood"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-fourth-person-is-effectively-cured-of-hiv-following-a-stem-cell-transplant"&gt;City of Hope, California&lt;/a&gt; patients – the stem cell donors had two copies of a rare mutation called CCR5 Δ32.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183527" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-attachment.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183527" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-attachment.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-attachment-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183527" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An illustration of HIV (left) attaching itself to a cell. (&lt;a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/enep9d4h/images?id=w7u2swun"&gt;David S. Goodsell, The Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation essentially breaks the CCR5 'keyhole' HIV attaches to, preventing the virus from entering in the first place. With two mutated copies of CCR5 – one inherited from each parent – donated immune cells lack any functioning CCR5 receptors, preventing HIV from unlocking the door and depriving the virus of new places to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B2 already had one copy of the CCR5 Δ32 mutation that he'd inherited from a parent. Nonetheless, he was diagnosed with HIV in 2009 and, after falling ill in 2015, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors found a matching stem cell donor, though they also had just one copy of the mutation. So B2 underwent chemotherapy and a full stem cell transplant later that year. His condition improved to the point that, in 2018, and against medical advice, he stopped taking ART. This marks the beginning of his remission timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the virus levels in B2's body have remained undetectable and may even be nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case suggests that double copies of CCR5 Δ32 are not a requirement for durable HIV remission after stem cell treatment, and that the graft-versus-reservoir response may work in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is supported by the sixth patient, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sixth-hiv-patient-declared-in-remission-will-need-to-be-watched-closely"&gt;a man from Geneva&lt;/a&gt; whose stem cell donor lacked the CCR5 Δ32 allele entirely. He stopped taking ART in 2021 and remains in remission at the time of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2014/boston-patients-experience-hiv-rebound-after-stem-cell-transplants"&gt;two patients from Boston&lt;/a&gt; who also received stem cell transplants from regular CCR5 donors experienced viral rebound, indicating the need for further investigation to understand what's happening in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCR5 Δ32 stem cell procedure is unlikely to become a standard treatment for HIV patients. Chemotherapy and full stem cell transplant are tough on the body, with a relatively high risk of lifelong health complications and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, its success could inform treatments that exploit similar mechanisms. The Geneva patient and B2's cases are exciting because they shift the focus away from finding rare unicorn donors to the question of how to replicate reservoir reduction, partial CCR5 protection, and graft-versus-reservoir responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These may all be achievable through pharmaceutical treatments and gene editing, and research is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI144486"&gt;already underway&lt;/a&gt; to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the case of the second Berlin patient B2 suggests that significant reductions of persistent reservoirs can lead to HIV cure independent of homozygous CCR5Δ32-mediated viral resistance," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09893-0"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores the critical importance of modulating and potentially eliminating the HIV reservoir in strategies aimed at long-term remission and cure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09893-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The world is a few steps closer to a cure for HIV, a hopeful sign illuminated by two studies published Monday that feature the work of several Seattle researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers, which appear in the journal Nature, present new evidence of long-term, potential treatments for the virus that causes AIDS. The work was published on &lt;a href="https://worldaidsday.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt;, an international event marked every year on the first of December, when people aim to raise awareness of the epidemic, salute ongoing efforts toward a cure and remember lives lost. This year is the first since 1988 the United States will not commemorate the day, per a U.S. State Department directive, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/health/trump-us-world-aids-day.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies bring together formidable teams of more than 40 scientists, clinicians, pharmacologists, statisticians and others from all over the world who have dedicated much of their careers to HIV research, including two researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and two from the University of Washington. The findings are cause for celebration, said Lillian Cohn, an immunologist and assistant professor at Fred Hutch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/health/hiv-lenacapavir-vaccine-trump-cuts-africa.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;fading support&lt;/a&gt; of crucial HIV programs is hard to ignore, said Cohn, who studies how the immune system works to fight the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in a very paradoxical moment in the world,” she said. “The science is at the best point it’s ever been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, researchers are watching an “incredible pullback in both leadership positions within the government that support this kind of work and in actual funding,” she said. “For those of us in the field, it honestly feels very dire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09929-5" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;paper Cohn worked&lt;/a&gt; on highlights work toward a new treatment — a combination immunotherapy — that merges three separate, previously studied approaches, and appears to effectively mean long-term remission for people living with HIV without having to take ongoing medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, scientists have made lifesaving advances around prevention and treatment, including the creation of medication that suppresses HIV to undetectable levels, blocks transmission and prevents the development of AIDS. That medicine, known as antiretroviral therapy, was a turning point for the fight against the virus and is still used today, most commonly as a daily pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if people living with HIV stop that treatment, most will immediately rebound, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the goal of this study was to try several back-to-back strategies that could hopefully help the immune system better fight the virus on its own, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead investigators, based at the University of California, San Francisco, “basically threw the kitchen sink at this problem,” Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, researchers gave participants a therapeutic vaccine. Next, they received a compound designed to help wake the sleeping infected cells. Then, they were given a broadly neutralizing antibody, or bnAb, which are powerful antibodies that block many strains of the quickly mutating HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then they stopped treatment in these people and watched what happened,” Cohn said. “And what happened was honestly pretty miraculous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that 7 in 10 participants were able to control their virus in a “completely different way,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size is small, and there are still questions about how widespread this treatment could be, Cohn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s a proof-of-principle that it’s possible to do this,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09893-0" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;other paper published Monday&lt;/a&gt; reveals a finding around another rare case of a possible “cure” in a patient from Berlin, said Daniel Reeves, who worked on the study and researches infectious disease and evolutionary biology using mathematical models at Fred Hutch. To date, there are fewer than 10 known instances of long-term remission from HIV without ongoing treatment, Reeves said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study centers on an emerging treatment that involves stem cell transplants from donors with an uncommon genetic mutation — but a version that differs slightly from one scientists had studied in the past. This therapy targets a specific group: people living with HIV who also have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years, various transplant methods have played a key role in the search for an HIV cure. The first person in the world reported to be cured of the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2020/09/timothy-ray-brown-obit.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a man originally from Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, underwent a bone marrow transplant in Berlin in 2007 after being diagnosed with leukemia. The procedure involved receiving stem cells from a donor who carried a mutation that provides natural resistance to HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation, known as delta 32, occurs in about 5% to 10% of northern and some southern Europeans, Reeves said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study offers a notable difference from past transplants. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Seattle man, Timothy Ray Brown — who was initially introduced to the world as the “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/health/timothy-ray-brown-first-patient-cured-of-hiv-dies-at-54.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Berlin patient&lt;/a&gt;” — received stem cells from someone with a particular type of delta 32, a homozygous version that means there were two copies of the mutation in their genome, Reeves said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this most recent patient, who also underwent care in Berlin, received a transplant from a donor with a heterozygous delta 32, meaning they had just one copy of the mutation, which is about 10 times more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That opens the door to a bigger donor pool,” Reeves said. “There’s a lot more people that have just one copy of this mutation versus both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure is very expensive and dangerous, involving full-body radiation and chemotherapy to deplete a person’s cells, which is why it’s not widely accessible to the average person living with HIV, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Fred Hutch researchers noted the process has been attempted many times over the years, following the success of Brown’s case, and few have worked out the same way. There’s still much to be understood about why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, another Berlin patient appears to have reached long-term remission, with no detectable virus for at least six years, Reeves said. This person is not currently being identified, but is a man who received a stem cell transplant for leukemia in 2015; in late 2018, he stopped taking antiretroviral medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both papers demonstrate valuable strides, Reeves and Cohn emphasized these treatments are not yet scalable or realistic for all 40 million-plus people living with HIV throughout the world. The work continues, they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the future of related projects is at risk, largely due to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;freezes on programs like PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, first authorized in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush. PEPFAR is &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar-latest-global-results-factsheet-dec-2024/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; with having saved 26 million lives and providing HIV treatment for millions of people across 55 countries, according to the State Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The community is so strong and interconnected now,” Reeves said. “The amount everyone knows is just amazing, and all that feels optimistic and hopeful. So to imagine pulling back from that — the de-prioritization of this work — feels extra painful.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that taking vitamin D in the morning may be more effective than in the evening, as evening intake can reduce melatonin production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Melatonin helps you feel sleepy, while vitamin D and melatonin work in opposition. Sun exposure affects your vitamin D levels, which in turn regulate melatonin production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Conversely, melatonin production increases when there's less sunlight, such as during winter or at higher latitudes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, your vitamin D levels can influence your sleep, with &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-deficiency-3014720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low levels&lt;/a&gt; contributing to poor sleep quality and duration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While your body absorbs vitamin D within 24 hours, peak levels typically occur 7 to 14 days after supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Know your tolerable upper limit (UL) for vitamin D to avoid potential toxicity from excess intake. Consider your food, sunlight exposure, and supplements, including multivitamins, when evaluating your vitamin D intake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended amount&lt;/strong&gt;: The amount of vitamin D for healthy adults to take from supplements generally considered safe is up to 1,000 to 2,000 IUs per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolerable upper limit&lt;/strong&gt;: The UL represents the maximum daily amount of a vitamin that is unlikely to cause adverse health effects. The upper limit for vitamin D for all adults 18 and older is 4,000 IU (100 micrograms).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxicity&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Too much vitamin D is toxic because it affects calcium in the body. Excessive vitamin D intake can lead to very high calcium levels, which may cause vomiting, muscle weakness, dehydration, and kidney stones, among other symptoms. In severe cases, vitamin D toxicity causes kidney failure, irregular heartbeat, soft tissue calcification, and even death. Vitamin D toxicity occurs from regularly taking high-dose vitamin D supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your current vitamin D levels, you may need a supplement. They come in various dosages, with some exceeding the tolerable upper limit of 4,000 IU per day. Avoid taking more than 4,000 IUs of vitamin D daily unless your healthcare provider advises.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D supplements are available as &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-two-vs-d-three-7095309" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)&lt;/a&gt;. Some research suggests that vitamin D3 is better at maintaining circulating nutrient levels during the fall and winter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you live in the northern hemisphere, you may want to consider evaluating your vitamin D levels and possibly supplementing from October through March.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most multivitamins contain 400 to 600 IU of vitamin D, around the daily amount needed for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, choose a supplement based on your vitamin D blood test results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Ultraviolet (UV) rays activate &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-vitamin-d-supplement-make-skin-darker-11680093" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3 in the skin&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into its active form. To get vitamin D from the sun, expose your face, arms, hands, and legs to sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for at least five to 30 minutes, twice a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, balancing skin damage from the sun with vitamin D production is challenging. Using sunscreen can prevent your body from producing vitamin D.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specific populations are particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency. Understanding these risks can help inform your dietary choices and the need for supplementation to support your overall health.

People covering their bodies or using high SPF sunscreens absorb less vitamin D from sunlight. In winter, particularly at latitudes above 37 degrees, decreased sunlight and increased clothing lead to lower vitamin D synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark skin pigmentation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Melanin, the compound responsible for skin pigmentation, causes individuals with darker skin to absorb less UV light, making it more challenging to produce vitamin D.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D needs are not increased during pregnancy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Most prenatal supplements contain some vitamin D to ensure a pregnant person gets enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism&lt;/strong&gt;: Some studies suggest that people with autism may have lower vitamin D levels and would benefit from supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At risk of type 1 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the pancreas fails to produce insulin. Research suggests that vitamin D may help protect insulin-producing cells. Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Vitamin D supports glucose metabolism, and low levels are linked to an increased risk and progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditions that impact fat or vitamin absorption&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Changes to the gastrointestinal tract that affect absorption impact vitamin D levels. People with short bowel disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and, to a lesser extent, ulcerative colitis, tend to have lower circulating vitamin D levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastric bypass surgery&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery) changes the structure of the gastrointestinal tract. This affects nutrient absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older adults&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The body’s ability to produce vitamin D from the sun decreases with age. Additionally, older adults may be less likely to spend significant time outdoors, especially during peak sun hours.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The risk of bone loss increases with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity&lt;/strong&gt;: Low vitamin D levels can occur among people living with obesity due to multiple factors, including less time outdoors in the sunlight, reduced vitamin D intake, impaired liver production of vitamin D, and increased storage of vitamin D in fat (adipose) cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian or vegan diet&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A vegetarian or vegan diet may provide inadequate vitamin D, especially if it excludes eggs, dairy, and fortified foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is common among people with AUD. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for liver damage and impaired blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific medications&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Taking vitamin D with statin medications that lower cholesterol may reduce the medication’s effectiveness. Thiazide diuretics decrease the removal of calcium from the body. Vitamin D supplements increase calcium absorption, so taking vitamin D with thiazide diuretics may lead to elevated calcium (hypercalcemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Prof Bullmore joined King’s College in the 1990s, the view was very much that schizophrenia was a mind problem, because unlike Alzheimer’s – where “the brain will be visibly shrunken” – in schizophrenia, “there’s nothing you can see under the microscope that’s a clear-cut abnormality.” In the 2010s, when new brain scan methods first emerged and big statistical analyses could be carried out on a number of different studies using them, scientists found a definitive difference in the brains of people with schizophrenia: reduced grey matter and cortical thickness (the outer layer of the brain), in the frontal and temporal lobes in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Prof Bullmore’s work has shown that the most important thing is the connections between neurons, which are not directly visible in brain scans. In childhood, these networks form very quickly and are pruned back during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s where you get into trying to understand, how do our brains normally develop? And that shifts your attention to the early years of life, because that’s the prime time for brain development.” Around 10 years ago, it was discovered that this pruning is actually done by the brain’s own immune cells. In Alzheimer’s too, “the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-best-supplements-healthy-ageing/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; starts getting inflamed and effectively attacking these odd proteins [amyloid plaques] that have appeared in the brain, and that probably contributes to the damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding explained a lot of strange discoveries in the field. Such as that “if you were born in the winter, you had a higher risk of developing schizophrenia. It was very difficult to say why – it sounded a little like astrology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing link, Prof Bullmore believes, is that infections contracted in childhood (or even in the womb) are interrupting the normal pruning of these networks, in children who already have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. According to twin studies, the condition seems to be about 70 per cent down to genetics, the remaining 30 per cent leaving space for whether these genes are “switched on” or not. Viral infections that affect the central nervous system, such as influenza and rubella, are especially likely to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/08/childhood-trauma-expert-benjamin-perks/"&gt;Childhood trauma&lt;/a&gt; seems to have a similar effect. “Like infection, trauma could impact on brain development at that particularly critical early phase,” Prof Bullmore explains. And like an infection, early trauma “marks your genome, and it makes a difference to which of the genes you’ve inherited are expressed and turned into proteins, and become part of who you are”. Somehow it “literally gets under the skin”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How cannabis and AI can could pose a danger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Prof Bullmore’s ideas about schizophrenia were formed when he was a young man, in the canteen of the institute of psychiatry at King’s. That was where he’d hear about new kinds of technology, such as MRI scans, or new statistical methods that could reveal clues about how schizophrenia develops. In some ways the canteen has changed – there’s a neon sign and the walls are painted orange, “and it’s much busier with students than it used to be” – but in many ways it feels like his old stamping ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Prof Bullmore recently heard from a colleague over lunch that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/artificial-intelligence/"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) chatbots have reportedly been causing psychosis across the world. Like many experts, he thinks that the technology really could pose a danger to young people’s developing minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s ultimately causal, but I think it’s another thing that could nudge the expression of risk to a clinical manifestation in the form of psychotic symptoms,” he says, much like cannabis use, which has long been blamed for cases of schizophrenia in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, “teenage cannabis use is associated with a modestly increased risk of later psychotic illness” – but, he insists, “it’s not a massive effect.” While smoking increases a person’s risk of lung cancer 20-fold, for example, cannabis use might increase risk of psychosis by two or three times in people already vulnerable to it through genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which could be more dangerous in the long run? “It’s too early to say,” he admits. When it comes to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/27/doctors-fear-chatgpt-fuelling-psychosis/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, “I can easily imagine how [deluded thoughts] could come back to you reinforced, corroborated, so you begin to put more evidential weight on that way of thinking about things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Can schizophrenia be cured?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is usually thought of as a lifelong condition, but “the rule of thumb we used to share with people was that a third of people will make a complete recovery after a first psychotic illness,” Prof Bullmore says. At present, “another third might have intermittent psychotic symptoms at times throughout the rest of their lives, but it really won’t have a major impact, and the final third will show long-term disability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Bullmore has also worked with the pharmaceutical company GSK. An exciting new drug for the depressive symptoms of schizophrenia is about to hit the market, he says, and he has a lot of hope that old drugs for different treatments could be repurposed. When it comes to Alzheimer’s, he is even more optimistic. He expects to see “a new drug to slow down the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer’s quite soon, perhaps within a decade”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes for people diagnosed with schizophrenia could also change, and numbers of cases could come down, with the right public health policies focused on prevention. Prof Bullmore points to phenylketonuria (PKU), a serious condition all babies are screened for at birth in Britain. Children born with PKU are put on a special diet to help them avoid phenylalanine, a compound found in protein-rich food such as meat and eggs, as eating it causes them &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/31/three-mild-blows-head-linked-lifelong-damage-attention-span/"&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;. Those who avoid large amounts of phenylalanine go on to live normal, healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to illnesses thought of as mental health issues too, “I think there are proper opportunities for taking everything that comes out of universities and turning it into meaningful innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Divided Mind: Uncovering Psychiatry’s Dark Past – and Reimagining Its Future, published by New River, is out now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium is essential for many bodily processes, and not getting enough of it can negatively impact your health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People may take magnesium supplements for blood pressure, anxiety, and migraine prevention, but it isn't a guaranteed way to treat any health conditions or worrisome symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before taking a magnesium supplement, you should talk to a healthcare provider to make sure it’s the best option for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium has recently been touted as a potential treatment for a wide range of health issues, from high blood pressure to migraine to anxiety. While it is an essential mineral, it can interact with certain medications, and you should check with a healthcare provider before starting a supplement.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
“Supplements can be helpful, although it’s best to review with a provider first,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zumpano-julia-4757482a/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julia Zumpano, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian at Cleveland Clinic, told Verywell. She notes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; Some studies have shown that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-surprising-ways-magnesium-helps-to-lower-blood-pressure-8759666" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplementation can modestly reduce blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but more research is needed to confirm the benefit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety and depression:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium may also reduce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/anxiety-attack-5088600" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; by balancing levels of cortisol, a hormone that affects your stress levels, Zumpano added. Preliminary research also suggests magnesium may help people with mild depression.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migraine prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; Some users on TikTok also claim that daily &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-for-migraines-11834187" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;magnesium supplements can help prevent migrain&lt;/a&gt;e, but research on this connection is inconclusive. “Some studies show benefit, and some do not,” Zumpano said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical performance:&lt;/strong&gt; While animal studies have suggested magnesium may impact physical performance—by boosting glucose availability in the brain, muscle, and blood—there’s not enough evidence to show the same benefit in humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-happens-when-you-have-low-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Happens When You Have Low Magnesium? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people don’t get enough magnesium, partly because so much of the food we eat is processed, said &lt;a href="https://www.memphis.edu/healthsciences/about/faculty/marievandermerwe.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Marie van der Merwe, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, coordinator of the applied physiology and nutrition doctoral program at the University of Memphis College of Health Sciences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-magnesium-11764364" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low on magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, you may start feeling less than your best. “Having lower magnesium creates a negative feedback loop” in the body, van der Merwe said. "It’s like a domino effect,” she added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium deficiency might be seen in people under a lot of stress, van der Merwe explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Typically magnesium is inside your cells, but what happens when you’re under stress is the magnesium moves from inside the cell to outside the cell in your bloodstream, and it’s very easy to get excreted through your kidneys,” causing you to be low on magnesium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When this happens, you may notice symptoms like headache or muscle spasms caused by your magnesium levels. This can make your stress even worse and create a vicious cycle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women need 310 to 320 milligrams (mg) of magnesium a day, while men need 400 to 420 mg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For reference:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 ounce of dry roasted almonds contains 80 mg of magnesium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup of boiled spinach contains 78 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter contain 49 mg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re experiencing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-magnesium-symptoms-7968593" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms of low magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, you should try to increase your magnesium through food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I approach nutrition with a ‘food first’ mentality, in that we should get as many nutrients as possible from our foods before adding in supplements as needed,” Core said. “The nutrients in foods are easier for our bodies to use and absorb, as opposed to their elemental form in supplements.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8579258" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t be used as a cure-all in place of healthy lifestyle habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you try a supplement, you can try to manage your stress level, prioritize sleep and exercise, and reduce intake of alcohol, caffeine, and processed foods, Zumpano said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you have covered all these bases but are still experiencing concerning [symptoms], that is where supplements can help,” Zumpano added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with anxiety, high blood pressure, or migraine, a healthcare provider may suggest medication in addition to—or in place of—supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle are key for preventing a myriad of conditions, you may require medication as a treatment,” Core said. “Supplements can help to improve health, but are not meant to cure any conditions.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s worth talking to a provider before making any changes, no matter how harmless they seem. “Always discuss your concerns with your doctor,” Core said.

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like every time I write about ultraprocessed foods, I say something like “It’s a hot topic.” Well, that’s still true. And a few weeks ago, the scientific journal The Lancet took on the issue in a big way, with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;a three-part series&lt;/a&gt; of articles looking at what we know about the impact of ultraprocessed foods on human health based on the available evidence, as well as broader-scale systemic issues that drive people to eat these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have always been several points that concerned me about the UPF debate, and I think The Lancet has largely addressed them. One key point is the gaps in the research on UPFs and health. Ideally, when assessing whether doing or not doing something affects health, researchers do a randomized controlled trial to find proof, but that’s challenging to do when you’re studying eating patterns and health. That’s why so much nutrition research is epidemiological, or “observational,” which looks for &lt;em&gt;associations&lt;/em&gt; between diet and health outcomes over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, associations can’t prove cause-and-effect. However, there is a set of criteria used to infer causality from observational studies, and the Lancet report says the existing evidence — including consistent results from large, high-quality observational studies and from short-term randomized controlled trials — meets most of those criteria. That accumulated evidence, the authors write, “supports the thesis that the displacement of long-established dietary patterns by UPFs is a key driver of the escalating global burden of multiple diet-related chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational research has found that diets with higher percentages of UPFs are also higher in calories, total fat, saturated fat and added sugar — all of which, in excess, have been linked to chronic disease — as well as several toxic compounds, including endocrine disruptor chemicals that may leach from packaging. High-UPF diets are also lower in health-protective nutrients such as fiber, protein, potassium, zinc, magnesium, several vitamins and phytochemicals. This appears to be largely because UPFs displace the primary food sources of those nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m not in favor of demonizing individual foods, it’s hard to argue that a diet high in UPFs, which can support life, also supports health. Do we need overstuffed snack food aisles? Do we need nearly 20 flavors of a certain chip with a name that starts with “D” and ends with “itos”? Of course, not all UPFs are snack foods, and the reality is that not everyone has access to fresh foods, the money to buy those fresh foods, or the time or energy or equipment or knowledge to cook fresh foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want our fellow humans to eat better, then we can’t hold them to unrealistic expectations — we need to meet them where they’re at. So when outspoken &lt;a href="https://www.jessicawilsonmsrd.com/makingitawkward" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;doctors and researchers&lt;/a&gt; say that starving is better than eating “bad food” and that soda, Cheetos and baby formula have the same impacts on the body as crack cocaine, they’re showing the elitist and out-of-touch side of the UPF debate that will never help anybody be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the loudest anti-UPF voices think we should just ban them outright. The Lancet report acknowledges in a more nuanced way that getting to a place where an estimated average of more than 50% of the human diet is UPFs is a systemic problem, not a personal problem. The report notes that our collective increased consumption of UPFs is driven by both supply and demand — we want food that’s convenient, affordable and palatable, and companies have supplied that food, then made it easy and enticing to buy more, because that’s what businesses do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This is why I am in favor of restrictions on marketing UPFs to children, because like it or not, we are influenced by marketing and advertising — companies wouldn’t spend so much money on it if it didn’t work — and children are more easily influenced.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the authors call for policies that reduce the production and availability of UPFs — including curtailing the political power wielded by the global food conglomerates that produce and profit from these foods the most — they also call for policies that increase the availability, affordability and appeal of fresh and minimally processed foods without creating more burden for those who have limited time or money. They point to a notable gap that remains in the availability of healthy, timesaving, ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat meals, but it’s this statement from &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Part 2 of the report&lt;/a&gt; that I want to frame:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ensuring equitable access to affordable, nutritious, and convenient foods requires confronting entrenched socioeconomic, gender, and racial inequalities that restrict people’s access to income, housing, time, cooking facilities, and food preparation skills. Reducing reliance on UPFs demands a cultural shift: valuing domestic cooking, redistributing food-related responsibilities — particularly from women to men — and challenging entrenched gender roles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always shaken my head at the cluelessness, however well-intentioned, of statements like, “There’s no reason to buy cheap processed food when it’s inexpensive to buy dry beans and cook them from scratch.” While beans are good food, and both inexpensive and nutritious, they aren’t a universal solution. There’s money poverty, but also time poverty. Also, someone may not have access to a stove or slow cooker, they may not like beans, they may not to be able to comfortably eat beans (hello, IBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final point, and one The Lancet did not address: I’ve watched the discourse on UPFs lead to anxiety and rigidity around these foods, with some people turning “I never eat ultraprocessed foods” into an identity, and sometimes into an eating disorder. If this sounds like you, please know that reducing UPFs isn’t the same as eradicating them, and you don’t need to eat perfectly to be a “healthy” eater.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He also noted that the red ribbon displayed at the White House was, “a symbol of our resolve to confront HIV/AIDS and to affirm the matchless value of every life.” Just a year ago, &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/" aria-label="President Joe Biden"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/"&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remarked that, “we renew our commitment to accelerating efforts to finally end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the &lt;a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743" aria-label="U.S. State Department"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sent an email to employees that stated, “The U.S. Government will not be commemorating World AIDS Day this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;HIV/AIDS Funding Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One could argue that a day of commemoration does not save lives. But funding does. And the HIV/AIDS funding landscape has changed dramatically during the Trump administration. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437" aria-label="UNAIDS"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437"&gt;UNAIDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, noted in a recently released report that, “this year’s disruption to the global response has exposed the fragility of the progress we have fought so hard to achieve.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The numbers are stark. According to the UNAIDS report, 60% of women-led HIV organizations have been significantly affected by recent funding disruptions. The number of people accessing pre-exposure prophylaxis has dropped in many countries. NGOs in the U.S. and globally have scaled back their services because of a loss of funding. The result? The number of new HIV infections per year could rise after &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" aria-label="several years of declines"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet"&gt;several years of declines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Current HIV/AIDS Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Today, about 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Roughly 1.3 million people became newly infected in 2024 and over 600,000 people died. In the United States, about 1.2 million people are living with HIV. And roughly 32,000 people become newly infected each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Globally and domestically, the number of new infections per year has dropped in recent years. In the U.S., for example, the number of new infections declined 12% between 2018 and 2022. Recent advancements in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention certainly have contributed to these declines. The long-acting injectable lenacapavir, for example, is a highly effective pre-exposure prophylaxis drug. Just two injections per year can provide nearly complete protection from the sexual transmission of HIV. For people infected with HIV, various drug regimens can effectively reduce one’s viral load to undetectable levels. And we know that U = U. If your viral load is undetectable, then you cannot transmit the virus sexually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But the gains that we have made in recent years easily can be lost. Stigma, discrimination, and inequalities prevent people from accessing services. Decreased funding will negatively impact the availability of HIV/AIDS services. Now is not the time to relax our efforts to ending the HIV epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;World AIDS Day may not directly save lives. But it is an opportunity for us to remember the gravity of the problem. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U" aria-label="Beatriz Grinsztejn"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U"&gt;Beatriz Grinsztejn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president of the International AIDS Society, recently remarked, “On this World AIDS Day, let us honor the strength of communities, the power of science and the courage of everyone working with, living with or affected by HIV.” On this World AIDS Day, the U.S. declines to participate. Let’s hope this decision does not contribute to a resurgence of HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Forbes</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOeUtYSDVpbEZ1alFiVk04NzhBNmlMZ0ZUdEo5eG84MHgwcE5McnQ2ckRNeTFodzRaQ2ZuRk9rOFotV09hOTdoTDdhSVlWdlhsUHhBZGNuY0Y3UHFtcmNMN3BnX3QxVDlERXg5ZWVhQmlRTFJPM0ZvUGtHaXdzTEUtclA4ak9rYUkwT1BjeWluSTkzNkw2Y3JLYjRiQTdIUWl0Z2lUS1FwcjNUZw</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织推荐GLP-1药物治疗肥胖症- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/recommends-glp-1-drugs-obesity-rcna245919</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1adfc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The World Health Organization on Monday recommended GLP-1 drugs as a tool to manage obesity in adults, marking a shift in the way the U.N. agency has historically framed obesity treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70f12" class="body-graf"&gt;The WHO said that GLP-1 drugs can be part of a long-term treatment strategy that combines medication with counseling on healthy diets and physical activity.

In the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 8 adults report&lt;/a&gt; that they’re currently taking a a GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition like diabetes, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8abea1" class="body-graf"&gt;WHO in September added GLP-1 drugs as a diabetes treatment to its list of essential medicines, but stopped short of adding them for obesity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd9cb7" class="body-graf"&gt;The organization's new guidelines — crafted by a committee of obesity, pharmacology and public health experts — came at the request of WHO member states, the officials said. They follow the approval of GLP-1 drugs by several regulatory authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5a706" class="body-graf"&gt;Many countries factor WHO guidelines into their health policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85ccdc" class="body-graf"&gt;The agency's recommendation is conditional, meaning the benefits likely outweigh the downsides but more evidence is needed.

It was a death sentence then but now you can live long and well with HIV so that it doesn’t develop into Aids. With treatment, your viral load can be undetectable so you can’t pass it on to another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If you continue to take medication, you will not transmit because it wont be detected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“There shouldn’t be any fear attached to having a diagnosis in this day and age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Annabel Overton, a midwife, added: “It’s important that people know that because that could be part of the barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Speaking to the rise of false information online, Ms Moore said: “I want people to rise above the misinformation and seek advice from reputable sources such as ourselves. Don’t use social media to get your information because a lot of that is personal opinion rather than evidence-based research. That will hinder the progress towards 2030 and beyond where we might see the elimination of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Fear is driving a lot of the stigma. Because HIV is lifestyle linked, people may misconstrue how you caught HIV. You don’t have to be promiscuous to catch it, it can be the one and only time that you have sex that you pick that up. We are all at risk of getting HIV if we indulge in sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said that within the island’s small population, fears persist about lack of confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“People don’t need to worry about confidentiality when they come here. Information is kept safe and secure,” Ms Overton insisted. “What comes into these four walls, stays in these four walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore said it was also important to raise awareness of treatment and support services including the Sexual Reproductive Health at the Department of Health where she works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said: “We have free services that include healthcare, emotional support and access to life-saving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We have in-house social workers, we work closely with the infection specialist as well as the Mid Atlantic Wellness Institute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Overton said: “Testing is free at the clinic whether you are insured, uninsured or underinsured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore added: “Treatment is funded so that you will be able to get your medication at very little cost to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids, and from a mother to her baby. It can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy where as untreated HIV can progress to Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore said Bermuda was fortunate to have eliminated mother-to-child transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Overton explained: “We screen very regularly during pregnancy, at the beginning, in the middle and towards the end as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore added: “So if it is detected, the mother can be treated and it can prevent that transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore and Ms Overton said that the facility it is working with LGBTQ+ support and advocacy charity &lt;a href="https://outbermuda.org/" id="link-1d25ee535fe0066dd9ee8e1912bceca4" target="_blank"&gt;OutBermuda&lt;/a&gt; as well as with HIV/Aids charity &lt;a href="https://helpingservices.bm/listing/star-supportive-therapy-for-persons-with-aids-and-their-families/" id="link-5082f6c99308f791532fb5c6f75da4dc" target="_blank"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We work through schools, health fairs, pop-ups events, Sexual Health Awareness Week and other events throughout the year to ensure everyone has the information they need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Health awareness events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-00d89de499c3b7452add720ba9ca8c2a"&gt;December 1:&lt;/strong&gt; World Aids Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-12d9f5a7fe9944d7a8c05c15276168cd"&gt;Mid-February:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Health Awareness Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-36a1cf30f9749117646d9b028c9092ea"&gt;April 7:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-a44eb03af3ca1302e27828cb82b4b959"&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; HIV Pop-Up Testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox-mobile d-lg-none"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Health awareness events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-00d89de499c3b7452add720ba9ca8c2a"&gt;December 1:&lt;/strong&gt; World Aids Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-12d9f5a7fe9944d7a8c05c15276168cd"&gt;Mid-February:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Health Awareness Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-36a1cf30f9749117646d9b028c9092ea"&gt;April 7:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-a44eb03af3ca1302e27828cb82b4b959"&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; HIV Pop-Up Testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;A report published at the end of 2022 contains information received by the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit from 1982 through to January 31, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;It showed that as of December 31, 2022, it was estimated that there were 295 persons known to be living with HIV in Bermuda, giving an overall prevalence of 0.5 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Report’s findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Since 1982, HIV has been diagnosed in 792 persons in Bermuda.

Despite dealing with an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation and muscle weakness, she has steadily rebuilt her strength. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a conversation with Nutrition coach Ryan Fernando, Samantha shared how weight training changed her life. In the podcast she shared her workouts 5 to 6 days a week and mornings are her personal favorite, as it “sets up the mood for the day”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On social media, Samantha’s fitness routine doesn’t give off the image of an easy journey.

			&lt;p&gt;A recent study points to a key bone-strengthening mechanism at work in the body, which could be targeted to treat the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;bone-weakening disease, osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, the study identified the cell receptor GPR133 (also known as ADGRD1) as being crucial to bone density, via bone-building cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"&gt;called osteoblasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene had previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108145"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to bone density, leading scientists to turn their attention to the protein it encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-deep-inside-human-bones-scientists-warn"&gt;Microplastics Found Deep Inside Human Bones, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran tests on mice in which the gene was either absent or could be activated using a chemical called AP503.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene, the mice grew up with weak bones, resembling the symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the receptor was present and activated by AP503, bone production and strength improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using the substance AP503, which was only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133, we were able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Leipzig biochemist Ines Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, AP503 serves as a biological button that gets the osteoblasts working harder. The researchers were also able to show that it could work in tandem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-provide-relief-for-backpain-if-you-do-it-safely"&gt;with exercise&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen bones even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the GPR133 cell receptor is a crucial link in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-spaces-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-the-bones-of-children"&gt;keeping mice bones strong&lt;/a&gt; is an important finding. While the results are based on an animal model, the underlying processes are likely similar in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age – similar to osteoporosis in humans," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg" alt="Bone diagram" class="wp-image-174316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-633x415.jpg 633w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;With GPR133 activated (on the left), the osteoblasts (orange) are more dominant.

While available treatments can &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/"&gt;slow the condition's progress&lt;/a&gt;, there's no way to reverse or cure the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments also tend to come with risky side effects (like an increased risk of other diseases) or become less effective over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;numerous factors&lt;/a&gt; that have an influence on bone strength, and that gives scientists plenty of scope for finding methods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-bones-could-soon-heal-a-whole-lot-better-thanks-to-polymer-nanoshells"&gt;that ward off&lt;/a&gt; issues like osteoporosis and promote a healthier old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-material-made-from-blood-can-repair-bones-study-shows"&gt;In 2024, scientists developed a blood-based implant&lt;/a&gt; that supercharges this mechanism for bigger repair projects: broken bones. When skin tissue is wounded, our blood &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-synthetic-blood-clotting-system-could-help-stop-internal-bleeding"&gt;starts clotting&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/how-wounds-hea"&gt;the healing process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the implant called it a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202407156"&gt;biocooperative regenerative&lt;/a&gt;" material: it uses synthetic peptides to improve the structure and function of the barrier naturally formed by blood when it clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on rats, the gel-like substance – which can be 3D-printed – was effective in repairing bone damage.

In the United States, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one person dies every 34 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), according to the CDC. The global burden is rising, and CVDs resulted in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;19.8 million deaths globally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in 2022, as per the WHO. Placing heart health should be the topmost priority today. In a newsletter, Dr Jeremy London, a board-certified cardiovascular surgeon trained at the Joseph Hospital in Denver and Carolinas Medical Center, NC, talks about the common traits found in heart surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Common traits found in heart surgery patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surgeon, who has over 25 years of clinical experience, revealed that these common traits are often the driving force behind heart diseases in those who require heart surgery. He also explained why focusing on the modifiable factors is important. “The harsh truth is that surgery resolves the acute problem but does not address the underlying chronic problem. Behaviour modifications are the most effective treatment of the why or the root cause,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What are these traits? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoking is the worst thing to do to your body, especially the heart, according to Dr London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking damages the lining of your blood vessels, which has been directly shown to lead to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in your arteries). This hardens and narrows your blood vessels, restricting blood flow to your heart and other organs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In addition, the carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke binds to haemoglobin in the blood more readily than oxygen, reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches the heart and the rest of your body.” You don't have to be a chain-smoker to damage your heart. Even occasional smoking can lead to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004561" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;even low-intensity smokers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have a substantially higher risk of heart disease and death compared to people who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The good news is the solution is simple: stop smoking,” the doctor advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Obesity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second trait that most heart surgery patients share is obesity. “I have seen the rise of obesity firsthand. With fast food and processed foods increasing in popularity, obesity has become the silent killer,” the doctor said. He explained how obesity leads to high blood pressure and chronic inflammation that damages the blood vessels, resulting in atherosclerosis and elevating heart disease risk. A 2024 study by the American Heart Association found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/obesity-related-heart-disease-deaths-increased-in-the-u-s-over-the-past-two-decades?preview=cd9c&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;obesity-related heart disease deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; increased by 180% in the US between 1999 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr London noted that type 2 diabetes could also lead to severe heart disease that requires surgery. “Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle-induced disease. That means it will take lifestyle changes to reverse it,” he said. Simple changes such as weight loss, eating a healthy diet and physical activity can reverse the condition. Another study by the American Heart Association in 2023 found that one in three adults with type 2 diabetes may have &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/1-in-3-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-may-have-undetected-cardiovascular-disease?preview=cd9c&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;undetected cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genetics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth factor that increases the risk of heart disease is your genetics. “You can't run from your genes. However, you do have power over how they are expressed,” the cardiologist said. Yes, you read that right. You can still control how your genes express by making three simple changes in your lifestyle: diet, exercise and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The key is not to eat healthily once, go to the gym once or get a good night's rest once. Those are small victories. The key is to build a routine where, if you miss those things, you crave them,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If these are some of the traits you observe in your life, this is your sign to make changes. Just as Dr London emphasised, focus on the lifestyle factors you can improve to keep your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;The bumpy trajectory of human aging may have a tipping point as we enter our twilight years, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past the age of around 75, our bodies can no longer easily recover from injury or illness – a sharp decline in resilience that comes with a corresponding rise in the risk of dying, according to researchers at Dalhousie University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model looks at aging as a balance between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dying-cells-play-a-vital-unexpected-role-in-healing-study-shows"&gt;damage and repair&lt;/a&gt;, with the breakdown of that balance marking the point of no return into frailty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could help researchers and clinicians &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/standing-on-one-leg-can-reveal-a-huge-amount-about-your-health"&gt;better understand&lt;/a&gt; and plan for people's health care needs as they approach this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;Study Reveals The Surprising Age at Which Your Brain Reaches Its Peak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We find that natural aging dynamics are non-trivial and include a tipping point near age 75 where robustness and resilience become insufficient and after which individuals tend towards worse health over time, marking an end to a robust and resilient youthful period," writes a team led by physicist Glen Pridham of Dalhousie University, in a preprint available on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As several recent studies have revealed, the course of human aging isn't as smooth as you might think. Rather, the human body appears to undergo periods of accelerated aging while we're alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study into the molecular changes associated with aging, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-aging-two-sharp-peaks"&gt;humans experience two drastic lurches forward&lt;/a&gt;, one at the average age of 44, and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, research also suggests there's at least one turning point during life when organ aging accelerates. A study published this year found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;this turning point occurs at age 50&lt;/a&gt;, after which your tissues and organs age more rapidly than the decades preceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter our twilight years, there's no denying that health problems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-risk-of-dementia"&gt;become more serious&lt;/a&gt;, both in their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased vulnerability and susceptibility to health setbacks is clinically referred to as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cger.2010.08.009"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, and doctors often use a tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/older-people-in-hospital/frailty/identifying-frailty"&gt;Frailty Index&lt;/a&gt;, based on the number of health deficits a patient has, to predict that patient's health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg" alt="Graph showing trajectories of normal and accelerated aging where people become increasingly frail." class="wp-image-181856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging-600x453.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Research is revealing that &lt;span&gt;aging isn't a steady process, as depicted here, but one with accelerations and tipping points. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302593532_Cardiac_Senescence_Heart_Failure_and_Frailty_A_Triangle_in_Elderly_People"&gt;Shinmura, &lt;em&gt;The Keio Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pridham and his colleagues used the Frailty Index in a different way: to construct a new mathematical model of human aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they needed a robust dataset. They used data from the University of Michigan &lt;a href="https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about"&gt;Health and Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/"&gt;English Longitudinal Study of Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, which have tracked the health of thousands of people over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Scientists Reveal Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From those surveys, the researchers included data on 12,920 individuals who visited medical facilities 65,261 times between them, with a median age of 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They quantified each participant's health using a Frailty Index comprising more than 30 attributes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-key-way-to-slow-chronic-illness-in-old-age"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, difficulties performing tasks and activities, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they built a mathematical model to analyze changes over time in two key health areas: adverse health events, such as illness or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-biomaterial-could-finally-repair-damaged-cartilage-in-injured-joints"&gt;injury&lt;/a&gt;, and the time it takes for participants to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-in-hospital-appears-to-speed-up-patient-recovery"&gt;recover from them&lt;/a&gt;, using the Frailty Index as a measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Frailty Index rose, it meant the participant was experiencing more health setbacks and recovering from them less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, they found that both health setbacks and recovery time increased with age, until the participant reached a tipping point at which the recovery rate could no longer keep up with the rate of health setbacks. The age range for this tipping point was about 73 to 76 years for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both robustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the Frailty Index and a commensurate increase in risk of mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;the researchers write in their preprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We infer that robustness and resilience mitigate environmental stressors only up to an age of 75, beyond which health deficits will increasingly accumulate, leading to death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not exactly cheery, but the good news is that this information could help soften or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;mitigate the effects&lt;/a&gt; of this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg" alt="Illustration of a grey-haired man with walking stick standing in front of a bed with a window to the right." class="wp-image-181858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls can lead to sharp declines in overall health, but they are preventable.

These differences were not driven by repetitive responding that is typical of autism. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251385029"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior that may include strong interests and a preference for routine. Autistic individuals tend to experience the world with heightened or reduced sensitivity to sensory input, which can influence how they interact with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social behaviors of many autistic individuals differ from typical norms, but these differences often reflect communication styles rather than a lack of social motivation. Research shows that autistic individuals can display strong prosocial behaviors, such as helping, sharing, and comforting, especially when situations are clear and expectations are explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to non-autistic individuals, autistic people tend to rely more on rules, fairness principles, or empathy based on understanding others’ situations rather than on reading subtle emotional cues. When tasks are structured and communication is direct, autistic individuals often show prosocial responses equal to or greater than their non-autistic peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Paul AG Forbes and his colleagues note that previous studies suggest that autistic individuals show a flatter decline in generosity towards socially distant others compared with non-autistic individuals. In other words, non-autistic individuals tend to be the most generous with the people closest to them, but their generosity decreases relatively quickly when more distant individuals (those they do not know well or at all) are considered. This decline in generosity is present in autistic individuals as well, but it is much slower and less steep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study wanted to know whether this less pronounced decline in generosity with social distance is a consequence of autistic individuals’ preference for repetitive responding (whereby they might respond in the same way regardless of how close the person is to them) or is caused by genuinely higher prosociality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 37 autistic and 38 non-autistic adults. They were recruited via a local database of participants at University College London. 36 of them were women. The average age of autistic individuals was 34, and it was 39 for the non-autistic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed the six primary items of the Social Value Orientation (SVO) questionnaire. In these six items, they needed to allocate money to themselves and another person. The items offered various combinations of amounts allocated to the participant and to another individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each item, combinations of amounts given to oneself and to the other are presented differently on a slider; therefore, choosing the same relative position on the slider in different items results in different distributions of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants completed this six times with instructions each time to imagine an individual with a specific social distance from them, ranging from people very close to them, to people they barely know, to people who are complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For very close others, participants were told not to think of anyone with whom they share a household or a bank account (as giving money to those people might be like giving money to oneself), nor anyone they have negative feelings toward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the results reflected genuine behavior, the decisions were incentivized: participants were informed that a computer would randomly select choices to be paid out in real money. At the end of the study procedure, participants completed an assessment of attitudes towards money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that as the social distance increased, the generosity of non-autistic participants decreased faster than the generosity of autistic participants. In other words, autistic participants were more generous towards strangers and people they barely knew than non-autistic individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that these differences were not caused by repetitive behavior (i.e., autistic people’s preference to give the same answer every time). There were also no differences between the two groups in their attitudes toward money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Autistic individuals showed enhanced prosocial behavior, replicating previous work. Compared with non-autistic participants, autistic adults were more generous towards people they felt less close to. We extend previous work by showing that these effects were not due to more repetitive responding in autism nor due to differences in attitudes towards money. Our findings support an emerging view that while autistic people often face challenges navigating their social worlds, autism is associated with more prosocial behavior,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of autism. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted on a relatively small group of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251385029"&gt;Increased prosocial value orientation in autistic adults,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Paul AG Forbes, Gillian Hughes, Leonhard Schilbach, Sarah White, and Tobias Kalenscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 11:03:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNS1c4aWp2c0lkYUd6ZDM3S0NOeXdMeWNPb2RVbGtYOHJ1R2xIVTd4WlRycDFnSFZNYUtMTnNlMjVPbm9jMkwzNEZRc1BvZUlZd3Y4ZmhMYjU4TVlaVjBkZzdSRzB6WFc5cGxRS2pkMGVodHduRzZFcW1tX1o5cXlwY1h1dWo3dHM5WFNRNU43bjJCd2p1YVl3OVlUTm1MWWstNVQ3bnhqRHlBQUIwTVlN</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，人类大脑在整个生命周期中有5个“时代” - NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/science/human-brains-eras-lifespans/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Treston, now the executive director of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care and a member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS (PACHA), still remembers the quiet that fell over her mother as they walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They moved slowly between the rows of hand-stitched panels, each honoring a life cut short. Her mother stopped in front of a section filled with birth years close to Treston’s own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“She said, ‘most of these have birth dates around the same as you,’” Treston recalled nearly four decades later. She described those early years of the epidemic as “very daunting, there was no hope, there was just an acceptance of death and loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For many younger Americans, the epidemic’s earliest grief-stricken years exist mainly in documentaries and history lessons. They have grown up in a world with antiretroviral therapy, prevention medication and the possibility of an undetectable viral load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the country marks World AIDS Day, advocates warn that distance from those early epidemic years can obscure how fragile progress remains. With Congress still negotiating next year’s budget, proposed cuts to HIV programs have heightened those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Several PACHA members released a letter, shared exclusively with ABC News, urging the White House and Congress to protect funding, saying the reductions could reverse decades of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A man holds a rapid HIV test with a positive result in his hand in the offices of Berliner Aids-Hilfe e.

Multiple members also told ABC News the council has not met this year, raising questions about its ability to carry out its advisory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the letter, members warn that “Although progress has been made, the United States continues to experience over 30,000 new HIV cases every year. Without continued investment, progress toward ending the HIV epidemic will stall, cases will increase again, and the health of Americans will suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They point to the bipartisan Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, launched in 2019, which helped drive a 12% drop in new infections. Fully funding the program, the council says, could save up to $100 billion in health care costs by 2030. But members say House proposals would eliminate funding for domestic and global HIV efforts, cut more than $1 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and remove key parts of the Ryan White Program, which supports people living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “PACHA is a largely symbolic body whose members are engaging in another useless PR exercise that has no connection to the Trump administration’s robust work to tackle HIV and AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HHS is strengthening efforts to end the HIV epidemic by advancing next-generation HIV prevention and treatment options, strengthening viral suppression nationwide via HRSA’s Ryan White program, supporting emergency preparedness, and expanding access to trusted HIV information,” Desai added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, who has treated patients since 1986, the prospect of losing momentum feels painfully familiar, despite modern preventive tools that didn’t exist in those early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another PACHA member, Tori Cooper, said the stakes are not abstract but matters of life and death for the communities she serves. A longtime HIV advocate, she works as director of community engagement for the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Transgender Justice Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We know that when people have HIV and it goes untreated, they die, and often they die horrible, painful deaths,” Cooper said. “And I'm not just talking about people who do ‘dirty things’ or ‘nasty things.’ I'm talking about people who perhaps were born living with HIV, or people who got it and didn't even know that they had it, or didn't know that their partners had it, folks who have been in monogamous relationships for years, it's all kinds of folks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cooper said she fears a rise in preventable illness if people cannot reach clinics or afford care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Because people aren't able to get tested to confirm an HIV diagnosis, that means they're not getting the care that they need to get to an undetectable viral load,” she said. “If they have detectable viral loads, then it makes it easier to pass HIV along to their sexual partners or during childbirth or through accidents or injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Philip Chan, an HIV physician in Rhode Island who drafted the first version of the letter, echoed those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HIV is not a partisan issue,” Chan said. “HIV, similar to many other infectious diseases, does not discriminate based on, sex, religion, political party, it is important that we keep up our efforts to address this otherwise, more people will continue to be infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chan noted that Ending the HIV Epidemic began under the Trump administration with the goal of ending new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030. He said progress could be lost without continued investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, the quilt remains a reminder of the lives her generation lost, but she believes the country still has an opportunity to avoid repeating the past. She points to the bipartisan legacy of HIV policy, from early federal HIV bills to PEPFAR to the Ryan White Program, as proof that the United States can protect its progress if it chooses to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;“We have the tools to stop new HIV infections and keep people who are already positive healthy,” she said. “We can end the HIV epidemic, but only if we continue the federal support that made these gains possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNN1ZsOHFTY2ItQ3h1R1ZYbU1DaEZFeEVzSEFSUlcxMlZLaFlfVDV5RFhETHFrYWdHV1luSkh5VmpxeU1zeDcwb1JZX0UyaHV6ekpVOV85aWhnSXFoVXliMXhJNDhwRXhXVU9XbE83S283ZkZZMkR3VlJDbElpLTBSdUpGWWZ1dmxyRjc4WVl3NkRoOEFON3RtbTViU2k5emZldjVZLTJMWW5ScFFfTkE1VtIBtgFBVV95cUxPRlFlcWx4dzI0WDlUc0VKUGE2TGpaVzdlQVFwTlF0WnB3NW9Bejhjc3REdUxwMTF1RnBvekxuZnAtTlZtdkR1bGwySDNfYVNCSDdVMnNOcTBSVDdCV1hETWlVWmw1Y0NHUXFGTEluMVFuZE5HMGxoemFMNDAtRFJmNUhKUjcxVXZxeFN6VHF3MHFEak5DaE45WnBQYTJpQ29hVl9mZjhWSVBCbUV5eEdWZC1Nd3FBZw</guid></item><item><title>为什么唱歌对你的健康有惊人的好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251128-how-singing-can-improve-your-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Singing also activates a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/hbm.21173" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;broad network of neurons on both sides of our brain&lt;/a&gt;, causing regions that deal with language, movement and emotion to light up.

Some anthropologists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-017-9607-x" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that our hominid ancestors sang before they could speak, using vocalisations to mimic the sounds of nature or express feelings. This may have played a key role in the development of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150221" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;complex social dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2023.2197977" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;emotional expression and ritual&lt;/a&gt;, and Street points out that it's no accident that singing is part of every human's life, whether musically inclined or not, noting that our brains and bodies are attuned from birth to respond in positive ways to song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Lullabies are sung to children, and then songs are sung at funerals," he says. "We learn our times tables through chanting, and our ABCs through the rhythmic and melodic structure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Come together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But not all types of singing are equally beneficial.

   &lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is common in the U.S. — around 1 in 3 people have it. And many people may not know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For prediabetic people, their glucose levels are higher than people without diabetes – but not quite in the diabetic range.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You may see higher glucose rises after certain meals," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/people/sarah-kim" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Kim&lt;/a&gt; is a diabetologist and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. "And you might see it go up after you eat a cherry pie…. You may see bigger changes in your glucose, whether you're sedentary versus active."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approved the first over-the-counter &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;continuous glucose monito&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. Since then, more people who are prediabetic or without a diabetes diagnosis have started checking in on their blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kim says while these devices may not offer much insight for people without diabetes, they can be empowering for those looking to make lifestyle changes or better understand their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more science of the human body?

LEN, a highly effective, long-acting alternative to oral pills and other options, is a transformative intervention for people who face challenges with regular adherence and stigma in accessing health care. WHO released in July this year  &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240111608"&gt;new guidelines recommending the use of lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt; as an additional pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option for HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp and sudden reductions in international funding this year led to disruptions in HIV prevention, treatment and testing services, with essential community-led programmes, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and harm reduction initiatives for people who inject drugs, being scaled back or shut down entirely in some countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We face significant challenges, with cuts to international funding, and prevention stalling," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “At the same time, we have significant opportunities, with exciting new tools with the potential to change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. Expanding access to those tools for people at risk of HIV everywhere must be priority number one for all governments and partners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking &lt;a href="/campaigns/world-aids-day/2025"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt; under the theme &lt;em&gt;“Overcoming disruption, transforming the AIDS response”&lt;/em&gt;, WHO is urging a dual track approach – solidarity and investment in innovations to protect and empower communities most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of progress, the HIV response stands at a crossroads. In 2024:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HIV prevention efforts stagnated, with 1.3 million new infections, disproportionately impacting key and vulnerable populations; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-50099489" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-50099489" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;UNAIDS data&lt;/a&gt; reveal that almost half (49%) of new HIV infections occurred among key populations – including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender women, and people who inject drugs – and their sexual partners; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;while sex workers and transgender women face a 17-fold higher risk of acquiring HIV, men who have sex with men face an 18-fold higher risk, and people who inject drugs – a 34-fold higher risk; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;underlying drivers include stigma, discrimination, and legal, social and structural barriers these groups face to access HIV care; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;globally, an estimated 40.8 million people were living with HIV, and 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full scale of the impact of foreign aid cuts is still being assessed, access to PrEP is believed to have declined dramatically. The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition estimates that, as of October 2025, 2.5 million people who used PrEP in 2024 lost access to their medications in 2025 due solely to donor funding cuts. Such disruptions could have far-reaching consequences for the global HIV response, jeopardizing efforts to end AIDS by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Momentum for innovation&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“We are entering a new era of powerful innovations in HIV prevention and treatment,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis and STIs. “By pairing these advances with decisive action, supporting communities, and removing structural barriers, we can ensure that key and vulnerable populations have full access to life-saving services.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO prequalified LEN for HIV prevention on 6 October 2025, followed by national regulatory approvals that will increase access in South Africa (on 27 October), Zimbabwe (27 November) and Zambia (4 November). WHO’s Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP) supported these approvals. WHO is also working closely with partners such as CIFF, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Unitaid to enable affordable access to LEN in countries. Ensuring that long-acting HIV medicines for prevention and treatment reach priority populations must be a global priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Integrating HIV services into primary health care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;WHO emphasizes that ending the AIDS epidemic depends on a fully integrated, evidence-based and rights-driven approach under the umbrella of primary health care. WHO will continue working with partners and leaders to put those most affected at the centre of the HIV response. Despite funding setbacks, the resilience and leadership of communities offer a clear path forward. By strengthening health systems, increasing domestic investment, and protecting human rights, countries can safeguard gains and ensure no one is left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They include men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender people, and prison inmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In each case, offering services specifically designed around those groups’ needs has borne fruit – for example, LGBTQ+ friendly walk-in clinics can mean access to care for people who are stay away from public clinics due to the stigma around HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of those clinics and other outreach services have closed, along with swathes of community-led organisations, previously reliant on donor funding.

Those first few hours influence our cells, metabolism, immune strength and long-term disease resistance. When practiced consistently, simple daily actions can reduce inflammation, improve repair mechanisms and support the body’s defence systems. Cancer risk builds gradually over the years, which means prevention depends on repeated choices rather than extreme changes. Morning habits that improve physical health are among the most effective because they align with natural body rhythms and support processes that protect cellular stability. A thoughtful morning routine can therefore contribute to reduced cancer risk and a stronger foundation for lifelong wellness and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peer-reviewed research review published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reported that regular physical activity is strongly linked with reduced risk and improved survival outcomes for several major cancers, including breast and colon cancer. The review concluded that even moderate activity, such as brisk walking, contributes meaningful protective benefits when compared with sedentary lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Morning habits to &lt;keyword id="25304948" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="reduce-cancer-risk" source="keywords"&gt;reduce cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt; for &lt;keyword id="22312981" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="long-term-health" source="keywords"&gt;long-term health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move your body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning the day with physical movement activates metabolism and improves circulation, sending oxygen and nutrients to cells that need repair. Even 20 to 30 minutes of walking, stretching or yoga reduces inflammation and supports the immune system’s ability to remove damaged or abnormal cells. Morning exercise also stabilises hormones and supports a healthy weight, which is important because excess body fat increases the risk of several types of cancer. The goal is consistency rather than intensity. When movement becomes a daily ritual, the body stays stronger, more resilient and better able to protect itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plant-forward breakfast&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nutritious breakfast gives the body antioxidants, fibre and vitamins that protect cells from damage. Whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, oats and whole grains help reduce chronic inflammation and support digestive health. A breakfast rich in fibre supports a healthy gut microbiome, which plays an essential role in immunity and cancer prevention. Choosing plant-based and minimally processed foods also reduces exposure to additives and compounds found in highly processed meals. A bowl of oats with berries or wholegrain toast with peanut butter can lay the foundation for balanced energy and long-term wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sunlight exposure and routine regulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping outside for a few minutes soon after waking resets the circadian rhythm and helps regulate hormones, particularly cortisol and melatonin. Strong circadian rhythm supports DNA repair and immune surveillance, which are critical protective mechanisms against abnormal cell growth. Consistent sleep and wake timing paired with morning light exposure improves recovery and reduces chronic inflammation. Better sleep quality strengthens defence systems while maintaining mental clarity and emotional balance. A stable internal rhythm is one of the simplest yet most effective wellbeing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid tobacco and alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using tobacco or alcohol early in the morning increases exposure to carcinogens when the body is most vulnerable after overnight cellular repair. Both substances damage cells and increase the likelihood of mutations that can develop into cancer. Beginning the day without smoking or drinking significantly reduces avoidable stress on the body and supports the natural detoxification process. Replacing these habits with water or herbal tea supports hydration and digestion and protects organs, including lungs, liver and throat from unnecessary strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Schedule health checks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine self-checks and preventive screenings strengthen early detection. A short monthly check and scheduled screenings help identify changes early, when treatment is most effective. Many cancers respond significantly better when discovered in early stages. Creating a simple reminder system, such as marking a calendar or setting an alert each month, helps build consistency. Understanding your body and observing any unusual changes is a powerful step towards long-term safety and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer prevention begins with daily actions rather than dramatic lifestyle shifts. These five morning habits work together by strengthening immune function, reducing inflammation, improving repair systems and limiting exposure to harmful triggers. When practised consistently, they create meaningful, cumulative benefits for physical health and emotional stability. The first hour of your day becomes an investment in resilience, energy, and a future defined by wellbeing instead of illness. Small habits generate lasting change and guide the body towards long-term protection and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This content is intended purely for informational use and is not a substitute for professional medical, nutritional or scientific advice.

Yet, despite popping supplements religiously, many people still find their vitamin D levels stubbornly low. Sounds familiar? You’re not alone. A lot of us start taking vitamin D tablets or weekly sachets without really understanding what affects absorption, when to take it, or what lifestyle factors could be blocking results. So if your reports still show deficiency even after months of supplements, doctors say there are some crucial details you might be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Shovana Veshnavi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Principal Consultant- Internal Medicine, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Consultant- Gastroenterology &amp;amp; Hepatology, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Faridabad; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Senior Consultant- Gastroenterology, Medanta Hospital Noida to shed light on why some people continue to lack this essential vitamin in their body even after taking pills and supplements regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is considered an &lt;keyword id="31185279" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="optimal-range-of-vitamin-D" source="Orion"&gt;optimal range of vitamin D&lt;/keyword&gt; for different age groups?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vitamin D, balance is everything, too little weakens bones and immunity, and too much can actually be harmful. Experts say knowing your ideal range can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that for overall health, the sweet spot for 25(OH)D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels is usually between 30–50 ng/ml for most age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing similar views, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says older adults need a little more support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reminds that infants and pregnant women should monitor their levels closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala suggests 40–65/70 ng/ml for athletes, pregnant women, and elders with osteoporosis. He cautions that levels above 100 ng/ml risk toxicity, and 150 ng/ml is clinically dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Calcium &amp;amp; Vitamin D Deficiency in India: Bridging the Nutritional Absorption Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Many people take Vitamin D supplements regularly but still show low levels. What are the most common reasons behind this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been popping Vitamin D supplements faithfully and your reports still show low levels—don’t worry, you’re not alone. Experts say there are several hidden reasons why Vitamin D doesn’t always rise the way we expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that low Vitamin D often persists because of inadequate or inconsistent dosing, or because people take Vitamin D without dietary fat, which is essential for absorption. She also highlights that obesity can trap Vitamin D in fat tissues, making less available for the body to use. Conditions like intestinal disorders, genetic differences, and medications such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids can all interfere with Vitamin D metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that even regular supplementation can fail if there are absorption problems, organ-related issues like kidney or liver disease, poor dosing, or low-quality supplements. Timing and consistency matter more than many people realize, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala points out that many people take only 1,000 IU per day, which may simply not be enough for them. He stresses that Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so taking it on an empty stomach reduces absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do nutrients like magnesium, Vitamin K2, and calcium interact with Vitamin D, and why are they important for absorption and function?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vitamin D, it doesn’t work alone, it teams up with a few key nutrients to actually do its job well. If you’re low on any of those, Vitamin D may not activate properly, no matter how much you supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala says that magnesium is a major cofactor in Vitamin D activation in the liver and kidneys, and without it, Vitamin D stays inactive. Vitamin K2 helps prevent vascular calcification by directing calcium to the right place, and adequate calcium intake is crucial because Vitamin D and calcium are partners in bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Signs you are having too much Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that magnesium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin K2 function as a team—magnesium activates Vitamin D, Vitamin K2 ensures calcium goes to the bones (not arteries), and calcium needs Vitamin D to be absorbed and built into bone. When all three are aligned, bone health improves and Vitamin D works more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can gut health or digestive issues affect Vitamin D absorption? If so, how can individuals improve this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Vitamin D is absorbed in the small intestine, anything that interferes with digestion can interfere with absorption too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that gut issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, IBS, SIBO, chronic pancreatitis, or fatty liver can significantly reduce Vitamin D absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that conditions like chronic diarrhoea, inflammatory gut diseases, or previous intestinal surgeries can severely impair the body’s ability to absorb Vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more detail, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala emphasizes that Vitamin D absorption requires proper fat digestion. In diseases of the small intestine, pancreatic insufficiency, cholestatic liver disease, obstructive jaundice, or after bariatric surgery, absorption drops sharply. To improve it, he advises taking Vitamin D with the day’s largest fatty meal, ensuring enough magnesium, eating whole grains, fruits, and fermented foods, and addressing malabsorption medically when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does lifestyle—such as screen time, indoor living, and sunscreen use—impact Vitamin D synthesis from sunlight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most of us spend more time under roofs and behind screens than under the sun, and experts say that shift has dramatically affected natural Vitamin D production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency: Doctor explains causes,  symptoms and prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that indoor living and excessive screen time have reduced how much UVB exposure our body gets during the day. UVB is the wavelength the skin needs to make Vitamin D, but it cannot penetrate glass, meaning sitting by a sunny window doesn’t count. She adds that sunscreen can block up to 95% of Vitamin D synthesis, and air pollution also filters UVB rays, making sunlight even less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreeing on the impact of modern habits, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra recommends 10–30 minutes of direct sunlight exposure, three to four times a week, to help restore levels naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala emphasizes that air pollution is a major factor in preventing UVB rays from reaching the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line? Step outside more often, catch some gentle sunlight, and let your body do what it’s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there certain medical conditions or medications that interfere with Vitamin D levels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say that certain medical conditions and long-term treatments can prevent the body from absorbing, storing, or activating Vitamin D properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that a range of medications—like anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, rifampicin, antiretrovirals, antifungals, and long-term PPIs (acid-reducing drugs)—can either speed up the breakdown of Vitamin D or interfere with fat absorption, which is essential for Vitamin D utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that kidney disease, liver disease, and obesity commonly disrupt Vitamin D storage and activation. Some medicines, including steroids, anticonvulsants, and cholestyramine, can further reduce absorption, meaning levels stay low even with consistent supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more detail, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala highlights that conditions like hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption disorders can all interfere with Vitamin D status. He notes that anti-epileptic medications, tuberculosis drugs such as rifampicin, steroids, and HIV medications may also significantly lower Vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What form of Vitamin D supplement (D2 vs D3) is most effective, and how should it ideally be taken, timing, dosing, with or without food?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to boosting Vitamin D levels effectively, not all forms, and not all dosing habits, are created equal. Experts agree that Vitamin D3 is the superior choice for raising and maintaining healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that Vitamin D3 is more effective than Vitamin D2 in elevating Vitamin D levels and sustaining them over time. To get the best results, she recommends taking D3 with a high-fat meal and preferably in the morning or afternoon. She adds that daily or weekly dosing works far better than extremely high monthly doses, and combining D3 with Magnesium and Vitamin K2 helps maintain balance and long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala adds that weekly D3 dosing is commonly preferred and more stable than taking a huge monthly dose. For people with malabsorption issues, he suggests considering calcifediol (25-hydroxy D), which can be more effective than regular cholecalciferol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra points out that Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) stays active longer in the body compared to D2. While timing isn’t critical, taking it at the same time each day is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What symptoms should people watch for if they suspect Vitamin D deficiency despite supplementation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been popping vitamin D supplements regularly but still feel drained and achy, you’re definitely not alone. According to Dr. Shovana Vaishnavi, persistent fatigue, muscle or bone pain, low stamina, hair loss, recurrent infections, low mood, sleep disturbances, chronic back pain, stress fractures, or slow recovery after surgery could all be red flags that your vitamin D levels are still low. Women may even notice menstrual irregularities as a sign of deficiency. If symptoms continue despite supplementation, she says there might be underlying issues like poor absorption or incorrect dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala stresses that supplements alone aren’t magic—daily lifestyle habits matter too. Safe sun exposure, strength training, weight-bearing exercises, and a nutrient-rich diet make a big difference. Think fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, nuts, legumes, greens, fermented foods and cheese—foods rich in calcium, magnesium, and vitamin K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra points out that continuing symptoms like low immunity, frequent infections, and mood changes may indicate that the body still isn’t absorbing vitamin D properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apart from supplements, what everyday practices or foods can naturally support better Vitamin D utilisation and overall bone and immune health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to getting the most out of your vitamin D supplements, lifestyle plays a bigger role than most people realize. Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala explains that improving gut health is key because a healthy gut supports better nutrient absorption—including vitamin D. He also strongly advises cutting down on smoking and heavy alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Shovana Vaishnavi highlights the power of safe sunlight exposure, particularly on the arms and legs, as one of the most natural and effective ways to boost vitamin D levels. She also recommends adding more vitamin-D-rich foods to your plate, like salmon, egg yolks, cod liver oil and UV-exposed mushrooms. She points out that lifestyle habits such as adequate sleep, stress management, strengthening exercises, maintaining a healthy waistline, including omega-3s, eating fermented foods, and prioritizing gut health all improve how effectively the body uses vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 05:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxQVHhrNGxNNlVHRXAtV0RWdXBSdjVNSjVGZkRtbXhaVTlJUjRoM2JHZGFOV2lOX3ltSFdrQnU4NHFpQ29Ubmt5cFpSUXFuZmdqWG5hcm5ubVVjMkRvWTFjdk9pd01iRnNSVFFvNnF0N0tycmw4RVF3dXRYRnh0bExUYXlLeHNIWDBNaUUtZVZndXNoWkdXeEhMWURHNTRxNU9lcW5rc0pVcGhyR2l2ZFhYZnM4R0F3c3I5ZG5wVmVUdXNZbW40dDVsSE1YbXR6d2NSQVdnWS1GcnlVY0l0cXduMUpqSko4VXVDQThkbjUtNTh4S2JMcXBrbVUtd0RmcUxuMGxweHF6bmFDZGVJUERyOFRB</guid></item><item><title>澳大利亚药物监管机构对包括Ozempic在内的减肥药物发出心理健康警告--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/01/mental-health-warning-issued-for-weight-loss-drugs-including-ozempic-in-australia</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The medicines regulator has added two new safety warnings about mental health and contraception for people taking high-profile diabetes and weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there is no proof of a causal association, experts say the risks are significant enough that awareness is important as part of a precautionary approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) says that because suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported with these relatively new GLP-1 receptor agonists, doctors should “monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviours, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The warning of the potential risk of suicidal thoughts applies across the GLP-1 RA class of medicines (often called semaglutides), including Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda, Trulicity and Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;amp;CMP=emailbutton" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sign up: AU Breaking News email&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2822453?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=082024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the World Health Organization’s global database of adverse reactions and found reports of suicidal thoughts were slightly higher than expected for semaglutide, even when compared to other diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following this international signal (an adverse event that is potentially caused by a medicine that warrants further investigation), the TGA asked its Advisory Committee on Medicines for independent expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found there was not enough evidence for causality, but noted there was a complex interplay between mental illness and chronic endocrine disorders for which GLP-1 RAs may be used for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search of the TGA’s database of adverse event notifications for the GLP-1 RA class up to September found there were 72 reports for suicidal ideation, six reports for depressional suicide, four reports of suicide attempt, two reports of completed suicide and one report of self-injurious ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data on semaglutide prescriptions on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme show there were &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/professional/are-we-at-a-watershed-moment-for-weight-loss-drugs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than two million in 2023-24&lt;/a&gt;, but there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/16/ozempic-can-cost-almost-2000-a-year-australias-peak-medical-body-says-it-should-be-on-the-pbs-for-weight-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;even more users whose use wasn’t subsidised.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Terri-Lynne South, the chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ specific interest group for obesity management, said: “We do think there might be a subgroup of patients who may be more vulnerable to a worsening of their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the moment, that seems to be people who might already have a past or current history of depression or anxiety or on a antidepressant type medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies of patients who have undergone bariatric surgery have also shown that significant or rapid weight loss can be a “real triggering event from a mental health point of view,” South said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The TGA has also issued a separate warning around Mounjaro and contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After investigating the potential reduced effectiveness of oral contraception when first taking or increasing the dose of Mounjaro, the TGA said it could not rule out an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a precautionary measure, it has updated the product warnings for Mounjaro to include further advice for patients using oral contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive or add a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the medicine and for four weeks after each increase in the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It added that none of the GLP-1 RA class of medicine should be used during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;South said since Mounjaro had been available in Australia, the product information had mentioned potential concerns around the delay in gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What that means is [the drug] delays the food and everything else that you eat actually coming through the digestive system, and therefore having an impact on the absorption of the oral contraceptive pill, and therefore possibly the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;South said the warnings were part of normal post-market surveillance, which meant due to the smaller numbers of people involved in initial drug trials, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/23/two-very-rare-covid-vaccine-side-effects-detected-in-global-study-of-99-million" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some associations can’t be seen until tens of thousands of people&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="ed73074d-3687-4448-bba9-f729a283fb7f"&gt;In every decade, the body goes through changes but this is especially true for women in their 40s. Hormonal shifts can affect metabolic health, bone density and even mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/menopause" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/menopause"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt; and perimenopause—the lead up to menopause—can begin at any age, though most people experience it in their 40s and 50s (and some may enter premature menopause in their 20s and 30s). Regardless of when it begins, these changes can affect muscle mass, joint health and overall strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ed73074d-3687-4448-bba9-f729a283fb7f-2"&gt;Certified personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainerize.me/profile/dynamicbodyloading/Stephanie.Woods" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.trainerize.me/profile/dynamicbodyloading/Stephanie.Woods" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Stephanie Woods&lt;/a&gt; works with women over 40 to help counter this decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we hit our 40s, the body naturally begins a process called sarcopenia—the loss of muscle mass,” she says. “This decline accelerates with inactivity, leading to decreased strength, slower metabolism, and increased risk of falls and fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;that rebuilding or maintaining muscle through resistance training helps preserve functional movement, improves insulin sensitivity, supports healthy body composition, and even boosts mood and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Simply put: strong muscles are a foundation for long-term health and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve hit your 40s and have never picked up a dumbbell, you’re far from alone. Many people start training later in life or return to exercise after a long break. According to Woods, it’s actually one of the best decades to start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5JeE9USFKjQLdLXpT2sG6f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5JeE9USFKjQLdLXpT2sG6f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s never too late,” she says. “In your 40s, you’re likely still in good health, but muscle and bone density are starting to decline. This means that small, consistent efforts now can dramatically improve your future quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strength training at this stage not only reverses early muscle loss but also improves joint integrity, metabolism, and hormone balance,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners, she says, can make fast, measurable progress with simple, consistent training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining strength isn’t just about fitness, it’s about independence, vitality and longevity,” says Woods. “Strength training plays a huge role in your healthspan and not just your lifespan,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Woods has chosen three beginner-friendly, equipment-light exercises that lay the foundations for lifelong strength and joint health. She’s also included modifications for those who are still progressing to the full move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-bodyweight-squat" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-bodyweight-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

The box squat variation helps build confidence and strength for lowering deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-push-up" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-push-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

They also help maintain bone density in the arms and spine. For beginners, incline push-ups—with your hands on a countertop, box or bench—make the movement accessible while still building strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="3f8fe7aa-4c83-4431-8c37-45bb5d0c4aa5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on your hands and knees, with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor or a bench or wall for the incline version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step back so your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your body down by bending at the elbows until your chest comes close to the floor or incline surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push back up to the starting position, keeping your core and buttocks tight and back straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="78dd1bc1-31ab-41f7-a277-a8a9e5a2e6e1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Beginners can start with a wall or countertop push-up and lower the surface height gradually over time as you get stronger and can do it from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-bird-dog" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-bird-dog"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

			&lt;p&gt;Specific immune cells in the brain may play a crucial role in preventing the onset of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study – a discovery that could lead to new therapies that try to coax cells into this protective state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.003"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that immune cells in the brain called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; can effectively tackle the symptoms of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183250" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, but also make them worse through inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, an international team of scientists took a detailed look at how microglia switch between those two helpful and harmful modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models of Alzheimer's, Icahn School of Medicine neuroscientist Pinar Ayata and colleagues found that when microglia get close to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;amyloid-beta protein&lt;/a&gt; clumps, a tell-tale sign of the disease, they enter a special state of neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert"&gt;Alzheimer's May Not Actually Be a Brain Disease, Reveals Expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microglia are not simply destructive responders in Alzheimer's disease – they can become the brain's protectors," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/protective-microglia-subtype-offers-potential-new-therapeutic-pathway-in-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Anne Schaefer, from the Icahn School of Medicine in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding extends our earlier observations on the remarkable plasticity of microglia states and their important roles in diverse brain functions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MicrogliaScan.jpg" alt="Microglia in mouse brains" class="wp-image-183253 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MicrogliaScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MicrogliaScan-600x505.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microglia (green) responding to amyloid-beta plaques (blue) in the mouse brain. (Ayata et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two crucial characteristics of this microglia subtype: The cells have lower levels of a protein previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4587"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, called PU.1, and a greater expression of a protein called CD28, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.immunol.14.1.233"&gt;a crucial participant&lt;/a&gt; in the wider immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia with this combination were better able to slow down the build-up of amyloid-beta protein clumps in mouse brains, while also limiting aggregations of tau – another potentially toxic protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;associated with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also stopped CD28 production in mice, finding that harmful, inflammation-causing microglia became more abundant, and that amyloid-beta plaques became more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all fits with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4587"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found the onset of Alzheimer's tends to happen later in life among individuals with a genetic disposition towards lower PU.1 expression in specific cells, compared to the general average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results provide a mechanistic explanation for why lower PU.1 levels are linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease risk," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25641673/protective-brain-immune-cell-state-discovered"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Alison Goate, from the Icahn School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a natural defense against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;Alzheimer's in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but one which clearly isn't powerful enough to fully stop the disease from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hopeful that future therapies might be able to increase the levels of this microglia subtype – though we need to make sure microglia work the same way in humans first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;incredibly complex&lt;/a&gt; disease, involving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;a host of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-at-one-stage-of-life-may-cut-dementia-risk-by-up-to-45"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, and so an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; will probably need to take aim at several targets at once. One mechanism researchers might consider for future studies is converting microglia into this neuroprotective mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also adds to our understanding of how Alzheimer's fits in with the immune system as a whole. The modified microglia identified in this study, in mouse brains, act in a similar way to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-discovered-t-cells-could-rid-late-stage-cancer-patients-of-tumors"&gt; T cells&lt;/a&gt; that roam around the rest of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery comes at a time when regulatory T cells have achieved major recognition as master regulators of immunity, highlighting a shared logic of immune regulation across cell types," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/protective-microglia-subtype-offers-potential-new-therapeutic-pathway-in-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;epigeneticist Alexander Tarakhovsky&lt;/span&gt;, from the Rockefeller University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also paves the way for immunotherapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09662-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And then, there’s the sibling who gets blamed for literally everything, from finishing the last juice in the fridge to accidentally existing while the other &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/family/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; member devours an entire cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s Original Poster (OP) was always blamed for everything, and was often mocked for being “fat”. In fact, her older brother had a habit of reminding her that her “overeating” would cause her to have an illness. However, she ended up having the last laugh after a visit to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info: &lt;a

confirming she was healthy, she laughed even harder which annoyed her mother&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, the OP lived in a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/art/home-design/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; where her body was constantly under scrutiny. At 140 pounds which was well within a normal range for her age, she was repeatedly called “fat”, especially by her older brother who ironically ate far more and moved far less. This same brother would call her “overweight” and warn her that she was going to develop a heart disease with the way she ate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she received no &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/worst-thing-happened-on-birthday/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;birthday&lt;/a&gt; treats, and often went without lunch or breakfast, her brother got bottomless servings justified by the fact that he was just “a growing boy”. Every time food went missing, from juice to leftovers, she was instantly blamed. It didn’t matter if she was at school all day or simply hadn’t touched it, her family was convinced she was the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she stopped defending herself and would remain quiet, but one day, her brother told their mother he felt sluggish and dehydrated and he was taken to the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/health/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;. A doctor ordered bloodwork, and the results came back with her brother diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. The shock was so intense, but the OP couldn’t help laughing at the irony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mother, furious that she dared to laugh, dragged her to get blood tests too, but her result came out and she was completely healthy. The OP laughed harder this time which made her &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/ex-gifted-kid-traceable-airpods/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; even more furious, leading her to tell the extended family about how she laughed at her “unfortunate” brother. Now, the whole family was lashing out at her which left her wondering if she was wrong for laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/brother-diagnosis-diabetes/?image_id=brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Am I The Jerk For Laughing When My Brother Was Diagnosed With Diabetes?" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/brother-diagnosis-diabetes/?media_id=brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9705628" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg" alt="Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns." title="Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/coronavirus-sample-procedure_10623631.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=0&amp;amp;uuid=ad6e0faa-7944-43ff-ab80-9a9537449a06&amp;amp;query=teen+boy+doctor+appointment" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;freepik / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situations like the one described in the OP’s case, the family dynamics reflect patterns of scapegoating. According to &lt;a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/family-scapegoat/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Choosing Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, family scapegoating occurs when one person is unfairly blamed for the family’s problems, absorbing criticism and frustration that really belong to the household as a whole or another family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members project their guilt, insecurity, or unresolved emotional issues onto the scapegoated individual, often using manipulative tactics like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/exhausting-relationship-fb-pics/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; or triangulation to reinforce the blame and further isolate the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are often worsened by sibling favoritism. As the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230809-the-lifelong-effects-of-the-favourite-child" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; explains, when one child is consistently favored, the others can feel overlooked, jealous, or inadequate, potentially leading to anxiety or low self-esteem. Meanwhile, the favored child may face pressure or develop a sense of entitlement, straining family bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounding these issues is a family culture that emphasizes blame over communication. Life coach &lt;a href="https://www.melissalloyd.org/unraveling-family-dysfunction-the-role-of-poor-communication/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Melissa Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; notes that families operating this way often fall into cycles of conflict and emotional distance as frequent victim-blaming, sarcastic assumptions, and top-down authority stifle open dialogue and prevent healthy problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netizens were firmly on the OP’s side, emphasizing that she wasn’t wrong for laughing and pointing out the clear irony of the situation. They agreed that her laughter wasn’t cruelty but a reaction to the poetic justice on display. They encouraged her to protect her mental and physical health, warning that her environment could become increasingly toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think about this situation? Do you think laughing in a moment of irony makes someone a jerk, or was it justified here? We would love to know your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Netizens insisted the author’s laughter was at the irony and that she wasn’t wrong for that given the way she had always been treated by her family&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online discussion about sibling mocking over weight and karma as brother develops diabetes, showing ironic consequences and family dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit user comments mocking brother’s food habits and diabetes as sister laughs at his weight-related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit comment advising to move out and avoid toxic family amid weight and diabetes struggles shared between siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit comment highlighting karma as a result of sibling mocking over weight and subsequent diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on forum discussing brother mocking sister over weight, with karma and diabetes irony mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenter’s perspective on sibling mockery over weight and diabetes, highlighting irony and family conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a Reddit comment expressing concern about skipping meals, related to a story about sibling weight and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment about a brother mocking sister’s weight and the brother developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on a forum about sibling mocking related to weight and diabetes, advising to laugh it off to avoid blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of an online comment discussing a brother mocking his sister's weight before developing diabetes himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment about food and weight, related to bro mocking sis and diabetes topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9705084" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9705084" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="19597"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9705084-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

These reasons are not based on mere hearsay, but rather on very valid observations from clinical practice and from the experiences of patients themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decline in Vitamin D levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most influential factors in winter is the reduction of vitamin D, an important modulator of immune function. In winter, shorter days with less direct sun means we synthesize less vitamin D. Specialists recommend checking vitamin D levels twice a year, typically in autumn and spring, so that supplementation can be tailored to keep values in the optimal range for immune stability. For autoimmune patients, maintaining serum vitamin D around 100 to 120 nmol/L helps to create an environment for a more balanced immune response. This is usually not achieved via a standard multivitamin; indeed, targeted dosing may make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Foods that boost immunity before winter sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Disrupted melatonin &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hidden culprit is fluctuating melatonin levels. Winter brings reduced sunlight and longer nights, which may affect the circadian rhythm and melatonin production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributing factors include less time outdoors, more indoor sedentary activity, and greater evening exposure to blue light from screens. Evening blue light exposure is particularly problematic, as it suppresses melatonin, an important hormone for both sleep and immune regulation. The specialists in autoimmunity recommend maximizing daylight, minimizing screen time near bedtime, and incorporating into the diet foods that naturally raise melatonin levels, such as pistachios, eggs, mushrooms, and cherries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Increase in viral infections&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colder months make people highly susceptible to respiratory and viral infections. Such infections might ignite or act as a triggering factor in autoimmune diseases, potentially leading to flare-ups or even worsening of ongoing inflammation. That would make prevention of infection via hygiene and good lifestyle habits, coupled with vaccination if needed, particularly important for people with compromised immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dietary and lifestyle changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter tends to enhance refined carbohydrate and sugar intake, both well-known to negatively impact gut health. Gut integrity is particularly important in individuals with autoimmunity, and clinicians have noted that diets high in sugar exacerbate inflammation. Additionally, most people with autoimmune disease have some intolerance to gluten and sometimes dairy, so seasonal shifts toward comfort foods can inadvertently trigger symptom flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduced activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point specialists make is that colder weather means less movement and reduced physical activity. Regular exercise is very supportive of immune health and reduces joint stiffness common in autoimmune disorders. As it gets colder, people tend to become more sedentary, missing the benefits of daily stretching, movement, and possibly therapeutic practices like infrared sauna or gentle yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comprehensive Prevention Strategies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists in autoimmune diseases recommend a multi-pronged approach for winters: exposure to sunlight or supplementation of vitamin D, planning regular movement even indoors, monitoring carbohydrate and gluten intake, and maintaining sleep hygiene. Small changes-like walking outdoors during daylight hours, consuming food that helps stimulate melatonin, and regular stretching-can add up and reduce frequency and severity of flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To conclude:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter brings many unique challenges for people living with autoimmune diseases, and understanding why symptoms worsen is itself a kind of empowerment. For many, supplementation of vitamin D deficiency, support of natural sleep rhythms, adherence to anti-inflammatory diet, and regular physical activity bring about much-improved stability and resilience during the season. It goes to prove that with insight and a host of preventive strategies, seasonal setbacks are just not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 02:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxQZGVFanRTVlFRNEl5VTFDN29DU0RiaXlKTXBBU3Z6amMtLUpWR2NyUlJVLXpqYkNOTlIyYWU1Qm85cDFIVS1oWC1jZzczWTFKWGtCMGJUaE9oNlBkY2dhZ1pseG1fbmdCQjdtbHNDV0RLMGFDUWNUd3MxdTR5MFB3dnF3ckxaeFk3S1hrazY1TlhWWmhrMXFjZnNIZlhhUkVvNUl4a1Nwa2NCa3NyM2VZTXhaSU9nNUJaT1pIMnplQkdVaFA1dTIzb1FoV0w1eGlacDNNdU5nanJFeGVsSGZJTVBn</guid></item><item><title>切罗基县男子开车一小时，浣熊穿着外套，脸部被咬，后来得知有狂犬病- 11Alive.com</title><link>https://www.11alive.com/article/life/animals/rabid-raccoon-bites-cherokee-county-man-in-face-during-car-ride-sparks-rabies-scare-after-refusing-treatment/85-30871aa8-7981-4644-ad0a-2a90633753f2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The man refused to provide his real name and gave the hospital a fake phone number, delaying contact tracing, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROSWELL, Ga. — A Cherokee County man’s attempt to rescue an injured raccoon spiraled into a bizarre and dangerous rabies scare this week at the Chattahoochee Nature Center, according to a statement from the center.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the man found the raccoon vocalizing in the road and, lacking anything to keep the raccoon isolated in, he wrapped it in his coat and held it against his chest for more than an hour while driving to the nature center, despite the center being listed to not accept raccoons.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the drive, the raccoon freed its head and bit the man on the face and hands, according to the center. He then drove home, secured the raccoon in a blanket with duct tape and proceeded to the nature center, arriving an hour before its wildlife clinic opened. Children were simultaneously arriving for a day camp at the CNC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff met him in the parking lot and insisted he seek medical treatment while they secured the animal. CNC officials said that after "much forceful insistence," he finally agreed to go get checked out at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nearby veterinary hospital agreed to accept the raccoon for euthanasia and testing, and a Georgia Wildlife Network transporter moved it from the nature center to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hours, test results confirmed the raccoon was positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the man initially refused to provide his real name and gave the hospital a fake phone number, delaying contact tracing. It was only when a family member called the CNC the next day that they were able to get accurate contact information for the man.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stressed the importance of calling licensed wildlife rehabilitators before intervening and warned that untreated rabies in humans is almost always deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

But one day, she noticed that the fingers on her right hand were starting to go numb — and it didn’t take long before her arms and legs followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My fingers kind of just stopped working,” Suisted, 27, recalled to &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/lifestyle/fitness-wellbeing/article-15322615/brain-tumour-disappears-Paige-Suisted.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail Australia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, noting that she received differing opinions from multiple doctors. “One said I had a stroke, but didn't even admit me to the hospital. Another said I had Raynaud's disease, and one just put me in a sling. They all told me something completely different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Hospital (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having grown increasingly desperate, Suisted eventually called an ambulance and pleaded to be admitted to a hospital for proper testing. After weeks of CT scans, MRIs and a brain biopsy, she was diagnosed with stage-four astrocytoma, a terminal cancer often found in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When they told me, I think I screamed and cried,” she told &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail Australia.&lt;/em&gt; “It was so hard to hear. I have a younger brother and sister, and all I could think about was wanting to see them grow up.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discovering that the golf ball-sized tumor in her brain was pushing on the nerves controlling the right side of her body, doctors determined that surgical removal would be too risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a 50–50 chance it would work, and a 50–50 chance I'd be fully paralyzed, most likely not able to talk or walk again,” Suisted recalled to the outlet. “So, we decided we weren't doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suisted immediately began to undergo radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The terminal diagnosis broke a lot of us down. I thought I was going to die and there's nothing anyone can do,” she recalled. “At the start of chemo, it really shot me down. I wasn't even aware of what was going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year of treatment and debilitating symptoms, many of which she documented on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/journey_through_cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, doctors were shocked to find that, one day, Suisted's brain scans appeared to come back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my last few scans, there's been nothing there,” she told &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail Australia. &lt;/em&gt;“This massive golf ball in my brain … we can't see any of it on the MRIs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors can’t officially declare Suisted cancer-free without performing surgery to make sure there aren't any remaining cancer cells, multiple professional opinions have deemed her a “medical anomaly,” and she has since been on a journey to regain her independence and confidence while advocating for others facing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They haven't had a cancer patient like this,” she said of her doctors. “They don't even understand it themselves. I just live my life every day now, and I want to help other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-27-diagnosed-with-terminal-brain-cancer-until-doctors-found-something-incredible-11859020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:44:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE94Q3NUSDRBS0F5S3hVYjNkLThFNC13eDZZN0ktQmZCTVhHTzBYV2poVU9ENTdpbGtjSW9xVzNBUlZEbEtOLWtGYURpMmdSbGRGVzEtbkN0TmZhZkdJaTIwek9QOC14dlRVaWdLQWhjNWg3dW8</guid></item></channel></rss>
