&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough drug is fighting brain cancer head-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, &lt;a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/02/fighting-glioblastoma-one-of-the-deadliest-forms-of-brain-cancer/"&gt;killing over 10,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; each year. There is no cure for the highly aggressive disease — many patients &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9265012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;survive just nine months&lt;/a&gt; after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and extending life via surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible and radiation therapy and chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) are &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recruiting glioblastoma patients&lt;/a&gt; for a trial of the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab. Sold under the brand name Yervoy, the monoclonal antibody stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncologists are optimistic since a 43-year-old UK father shows no signs of having a tumor — he took ipilimumab before his glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” said Dr. Paul Mulholland, the consultant medical oncologist leading the trial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We saw with Ben, the one patient recruited to the immunotherapy study, NeAT-GLIO, that he has had clear scans since having the treatment and the tumor hasn’t returned more than two and a half years later.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, killing over 10,000 Americans each year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Trotman met with Mulholland, who enrolled him in a clinical trial for ipilimumab. He was the first patient in the world — and the only person in the trial — to take the drug before glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” said Trotman’s wife, Emily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking the drug, Ben underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months later, his scans are clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumor that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben and Emily Trotman wed in 2023, after he began his immunotherapy treatment. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of UCLH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumor at bay,” he added, “and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, months after his diagnosis, Ben married Emily. The couple welcomed a daughter, Mabel, earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They enjoy taking her for walks along with their rescue dog, Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to live as normal a life as possible,” Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are in a unique position of which there is no precedent and which comes with a great deal of uncertainty,” she continued. “We want to live each day as if it were our last, but we also want to plan for the future, which we hope to have.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to recruit 16 glioblastoma patients like Ben over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking ipilimumab, the trial participants will undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy and perhaps surgery depending on the extent of their disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Paul Mulholland (left) is pictured with Dame Siobhain McDonagh, who raised funds for the new clinical trial of ipilimumab. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial is being funded by Dame Siobhain McDonagh, a member of the British Parliament, whose sister died of glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma,” McDonagh said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Changing this was Margaret’s final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment will take place at the NIHR UCLH’s Clinical Research Facility at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that this new trial, with the same immunotherapy drug I received, is going ahead and others will have the opportunity to take part,” Ben said. “It will give people newly diagnosed with glioblastoma some hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

Just days later, he celebrated his 17th birthday in the hospital and underwent multiple surgeries after developing sepsis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1466049471406647" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aneurin Bevan University Health Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aneurin Bevan University Health Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as a "medical emergency" by the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12361-sepsis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis occurs when your immune system has a "dangerous reaction to an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-09-2020-who-calls-for-global-action-on-sepsis---cause-of-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis is the cause of one in five deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mullins, his experience with sepsis started after he did something many others do on a regular basis — popped a pimple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geraint Mullins&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I enjoy popping [pimples] - and when I popped it, it was just a normal [pimple]," Mullins, now 24, told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nx3gzr1no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Mullins was left with a golfball-sized abscess on his neck, which he said developed "within a few days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he started feeling "very lethargic" and "quite out of it," Mullins went to his doctor, who sent him to the hospital to undergo surgery. The surgical procedure helped drain the abscess. However, the infection was still raging a week later, which led to a secondary surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, he still has a scar on his neck. However, the outcome could have been much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very close to potentially not being here," he told the outlet. "If I wasn't as fit, I could have been dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Mullins said that he "knew absolutely nothing" about the possibility of the deadly illness. Now, he's committed to raising awareness about what sepsis looks like and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that some of the warning signs of sepsis include "slurred speech," "extreme shivering," "severe breathlessness," and "mottled" skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the WHO, "only half of the people who are diagnosed with sepsis "will completely recover. Others face death or the risk of "long-term disabilities."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The world must urgently step up efforts to improve data about sepsis so all countries can detect and treat this terrible condition in time,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said in a 2020 statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC Wales News/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California-based dermatologist Dr. Sandra Lee, otherwise known as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrSandraLee" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Pimple Popper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Pimple Popper&lt;/a&gt;, spoke to PEOPLE about the "right way to pop a pimple," though she advised against doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Be sterile, be as clean as possible. Make sure you have rubbing alcohol, clean the areas, make sure you have clean fingers or gloves are ideal, and try to use as sterile instruments as possible," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, saying, “Ideally, you want to squeeze out all that pus that’s in there because if you don’t, it can re-form or get bigger. So you really want to squeeze it just enough so you get a little tinge of blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, "Know when to pop and when to stop."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-popped-his-pimple-hospitalized-days-later-sepsis-11775701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB6aV9MalJHdGRjdmdrUHJLMFU4dWo4YXlGU0gzOEFMeEpPZjZLa0x0SWFjTEpNYnlTMUpaaUQ4TXNtRVMxU0JlVng5eUdPS01rblI2WXRJaS1abkp0TjMtVWU3bjBzdVpDZGFtVUV3dzlPS0tSVmlObkpWRktMQQ</guid></item><item><title>官员表示，拿骚县的狂犬病宣布“迫在眉睫的公共卫生威胁” -新闻日报 | Rabies in Nassau County declared 'imminent public health threat,' officials say - Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5aNW9zcENuVVdPZTF4Tjl1OWxnaW0talJiaVZvMm9JNHN3eURPcThWb1JTb1JJaTV0a0FxS3pBUF9SNUtoY2w3QU1sWF90aXdVcWNiVjd5ZGgyTlotNF9QQ2FlUV9RQ1FZVm1aVDFNdmc4NUg5akN6ei1SLTYxZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="continue-reading ContinueReading_continue-reading__uTArZ active ContinueReading_active__SOMMR"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is now an "imminent public health threat" in Nassau County, officials said Monday, warning residents to stay away from wild animals and to protect their pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance shows the virus is circulating throughout the county, which has collected and confirmed 25 rabid animals since July 2024. That number includes both raccoons and feral cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid raccoons have also been discovered in Suffolk County this year, predominantly in the Amityville area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a rare but deadly disease that can be passed to humans by the bite or scratch of an infected animal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have contact with a rabid animal but receive prompt treatment can avoid serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resurgence of rabies in Nassau County, with its high population density and after nearly a decade of absence, represents a serious and evolving public health concern," Nassau County Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman said in a statement. "This declaration allows us to respond to prevent further spread and protect the health and safety of Nassau County residents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the declaration allows the county to secure resources and conduct activities to address and abate the threat, officials said. That includes spreading rabies vaccine baits in areas where infected animals have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is urged not to feed or touch wild animals, stray cats or dogs. In addition, it's important to make sure pets — including dogs, cats, ferrets, horses and livestock — are vaccinated against rabies, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County Department of Health asks anyone whose pet has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal to contact them and report any dead, sick or abnormally acting animal by emailing rabies@nassaucountyny.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

Although Kennedy has spent most of his public appearances campaigning for healthier foods, often with a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/dairy-industry-ice-cream-dyes-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flimsy basis&lt;/a&gt; in nutrition science, most of his policy changes have focused on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He fired all 17 members of a key vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reformulated the panel with ideological allies – including advocates directly from the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He also made Covid-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/pregnant-doctor-covid-19-vaccine-rfk-jr-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access&lt;/a&gt;; oversaw the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancellation of research&lt;/a&gt; into vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-effect-of-nih-funding-cuts-on-vaccine-access-and-hesitancy-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt;; spread &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; information about vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/vaccine-disinformation-trump-measles-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;equivocated&lt;/a&gt; about their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The greatest danger in elevating him to [Health and Human Services] (HHS) secretary was always that he would use his position to undermine public confidence in vaccines, which would lead to needless suffering and even death,” Bloomberg argued. “And so it has come to pass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bloomberg said that Kennedy’s actions were predictable, but that Senate Republicans either “deceived themselves” or “buckled to political pressure” to confirm Kennedy. He urged Republicans to pressure the White House to constrain Kennedy “or fire him”. If Americans die unnecessarily, Bloomberg said, Senate Republicans will pay at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The upheaval in vaccine policy comes as the CDC is tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an historic&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak that began in an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;under-vaccinated community&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. More than 1,300 confirmed measles cases have been reported since mid-July – though experts believe the true tally is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;far higher&lt;/a&gt;. That is the worst case count &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 1992&lt;/a&gt; at only halfway through the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. A supremely effective vaccine, preventing 97% of cases with two doses, meant it was nevertheless eliminated in 2000. Experts now believe the US may be entering a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;post-herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;” era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Three people have died in the 2025 outbreak, including two healthy children and an adult. All were unvaccinated. Measles kills between one-three children per 1,000 due to respiratory or neurological complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disease can also cause permanent disability due to brain swelling, and weaken the immune system against future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the aftermath of the deaths, he did not use his position to urge parents to vaccinate their children, or warn of the dangers of failing to do so, or declare vaccines safe, or allay misplaced concerns about them,” wrote Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Instead, he did what he has been doing for decades: He presented the safety and efficacy of vaccines as an open question for individuals to decide. Not surprisingly, the outbreak continued – and has worsened,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Guardian has contacted HHS for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9nYm9xZXcxb2prTXdQdW5La2ZIRE9LSVJ6c1Q0Z0JNbkxya0R4YTItT21KR1NtLTd4SlZMN3l2OERYeWR3dE9BQWgwZ3B2TFFsdjNWT2R4ZjJIcHU4RXdNM054SWhTdXFhaXVyNzV1eTJNVldkZHBnLTZWZk4</guid></item><item><title>在夏季浪潮中，这些州的COVID-19病例正在上升- AOL.com | COVID-19 cases are rising in these states amid summer wave - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE95TnF3SE5wNjFvZG85Zkg4RHZnUzV2MEk0ZHRBYldpcndNTlljcG01aDhJNjZ6bmlGTUw3b29jLWM1Q3ZkNXNJOFg0MUFpUWhPUWU1QmJrdzJUcDJkX19RRERuSXM1c3E0UV84Zlh0RzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-cases-likely-rising-half-of-states-cdc-estimates/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:summer surge of COVID-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;summer surge of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is here, with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing increases across much of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:latest report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;latest report&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said the number of cases is now growing or likely growing in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C.

"And every year, I just looked last night, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that's the good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, people shouldn't ignore the increases, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it strikes you, especially for the vulnerable, and we're talking about very young children under age of 4, the elderly, people who are immunocompromised — there are millions of people who are immunocompromised out there — they can really get sick," LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New COVID variants Nimbus and Stratus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest COVID variants, nicknamed Nimbus and Stratus, are "no more deadly" than &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous variants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous variants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, LaPook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on previous variants, like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-variant-nb181-1-in-3-cases-cdc/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NB.1.8.1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from earlier this year, for example, also did not show more severe illness compared to previous variants. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-symptoms-booster-vaccine/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains, too, including respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic issues like fever and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccines that were made for this season do cover the current variants, so that's good news," LaPook said. "I think the bottom line here is: Don't be blasé. It's the summer, people have all sorts of things. Be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I get a COVID vaccine booster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps protect you;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps protect you&lt;/a&gt; from "severe illness, hospitalization and death," there have been some shifts in recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaPook admits we're in a bit of an odd period right now because the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC has different vaccine recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC has different vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than many of the major health organizations and societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, says pregnant people should get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the baby ... before they can get a shot, they're really relying on the mother's immunity — the mother has the antibodies, goes through the placenta, and then the baby has some protection," LaPook explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. "said it's now shared decision making," LaPook said. "So that means that go talk to your clinician about it, which is always a good idea, but it's a little bit of a different recommendation than just saying, 'go get it.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also now recommends "shared clinical decision-making" for giving healthy children the COVID-19 vaccine.

For years, I have advocated for plus-size riders, and the need for bigger cycling clothing, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cycling-has-a-weight-problem-a-call-for-the-industry-to-be-more-transparent-about-its-weight-limits" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cycling-has-a-weight-problem-a-call-for-the-industry-to-be-more-transparent-about-its-weight-limits"&gt;improved transparency on weight limits,&lt;/a&gt; and inclusive riding communities. My journey was even chronicled in a 2021 documentary by Shimano, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JytAXpxmmQY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JytAXpxmmQY" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Bodies on Bikes&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; which led to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters"&gt;creation of a nonprofit &lt;/a&gt;dedicated to size inclusion, an organization I now proudly lead as Executive Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never let my body size or weight limit me. I have completed five &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;Unbound Gravel&lt;/a&gt; races at over 250 pounds, yet I’ll be the first to admit that my weight has made life challenging over the years.

But throughout my life, I’ve tried just about every diet out there. Counting calories, cutting carbs, Weight Watchers—you name it. None ever led to lasting results. Instead, I live an active lifestyle and have come to a place of genuine self-love and acceptance with my body. I wasn’t interested in pursuing intentional weight loss again, especially not just to change a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;But, as my doctor explained, this was about the impact of carrying extra body weight on my joints. Given my lifelong struggles with dieting, he suggested there might be an underlying issue contributing to my body size and recommended I see an endocrinologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;That referral marked the beginning of my journey with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes"&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/a&gt;—a class of medications originally developed to treat Type 2 diabetes, but now increasingly prescribed for weight management. At first, I was very hesitant. These drugs, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/lighter-but-weaker-the-hidden-costs-of-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs-for-endurance-athletes"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, have sparked heated debates about body image, diet culture, and what it means to pursue “health.” But for me, this wasn’t about chasing a thinner body or losing weight, per se. It was about relieving pain and staying on the bike for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As it turned out, I had insulin resistant PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). PCOS is a common hormonal disorder that affects up to 1 in 10 people with ovaries, though it often goes undiagnosed. One of the lesser-known but significant effects of PCOS is how it can impact metabolism and weight. Many people with PCOS experience insulin resistance, meaning our bodies struggle to use insulin effectively, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. This metabolic imbalance makes it easier to gain weight and significantly harder to lose it, even with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. This explained why I was seemingly doing everything “right,” that is, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/good-bad-hungry-diets-cyclists-rated-expert-437826" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/good-bad-hungry-diets-cyclists-rated-expert-437826"&gt;eating a balanced diet &lt;/a&gt;and exercising frequently, while still carrying excess weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As a p&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/im-fat-and-im-ok-with-that-the-size-inclusion-campaigner-seeking-to-make-cycling-safe-and-accessible-for-everyone"&gt;ublic figure who cultivates weight-neutral cycling spaces&lt;/a&gt; and communities, taking a GLP-1 felt antithetical to my identity. If my body changed on this medication, which was likely to happen, would I be betraying my values? Would I be sending the wrong message to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/marley-blonskys-all-bodies-on-bikes-org-launches-11-regional-chapters"&gt;All Bodies on Bikes &lt;/a&gt;community? What does it mean to advocate for body acceptance while making a choice that may lead to weight loss and body changes for myself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mSkrMmvsmJQvNFdaeQJXMc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mSkrMmvsmJQvNFdaeQJXMc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;What’s more, how would it impact me on the bike?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The side effects of GLP-1s have been widely talked about: nausea, fatigue, gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) and more. I got lucky and only experienced mild nausea and constipation, however, the impact on my appetite was huge. I suddenly had almost zero hunger signals. A banana at breakfast would satiate me until lunch, when half a peanut butter sandwich would fill me up. Which to be clear, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enough food for anyone, let alone &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/nutrition-for-long-bike-rides-what-to-eat-before-during-and-after-to-avoid-bonking-and-maximise-your-cycling-fitness-gains" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/nutrition-for-long-bike-rides-what-to-eat-before-during-and-after-to-avoid-bonking-and-maximise-your-cycling-fitness-gains"&gt;an endurance athlete&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="paywall van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marley riding Unbound, even before her medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Marley Blonsky)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;It quickly became evident that the appetite suppression part of the drug worked a little too well, especially as an endurance cyclist who continued to train and ride throughout this experience. My body, that I had learned to listen to closely over the years, was suddenly not sending the same signals. I wasn’t hungry at all. While that’s often seen as a benefit, it’s actually the opposite of what an endurance athlete needs. You need calories to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Instead of being able to eat intuitively and trust that I was meeting my daily needs, I found myself having to set reminders to eat, planning each meal for maximum nutritional density. Thank goodness for custom alerts on my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/reviews/computers-and-heart-rate-monitors/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-v2-bike-computer-long-term-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/reviews/computers-and-heart-rate-monitors/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-v2-bike-computer-long-term-review"&gt;Wahoo Bolt &lt;/a&gt;bike &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/cycling-gps-units-buyers-guide-181254" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/cycling-gps-units-buyers-guide-181254"&gt;computer!&lt;/a&gt; Paired with my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/heart-rate-monitors-351068" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/heart-rate-monitors-351068"&gt;heart rate monitor,&lt;/a&gt; it sends me a reminder to eat after every 100 calories burned on the bike.. This has mostly kept me from bonking while riding but it definitely isn’t fool proof. I also found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/energy-drinks-cycling-hydration-31549" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/nutrition/energy-drinks-cycling-hydration-31549"&gt;liquid calories&lt;/a&gt;, small frequent snacks and protein-dense meals helped ensure I was fueling my body properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;As the months went on, I started to notice small changes in both my body and my riding. Clothes felt a little looser. I could see my collarbone for the first time in my life. My chronic joint pain and inflammation receded, and my period started becoming normal and lighter. Perhaps most excitingly, I was able to climb hills that I had previously walked up. I felt stronger on my bike and noticed I was consistently hitting PRs on segments I rode all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;My first public appearance in a noticeably smaller body was at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/being-tough-is-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-moving-51-weeks-after-losing-his-leg-one-rider-returned-to-finish-the-race-that-wasnt" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/gravel/being-tough-is-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-keep-moving-51-weeks-after-losing-his-leg-one-rider-returned-to-finish-the-race-that-wasnt"&gt;Mid South 2024&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, I had lost nearly 20% of my starting body weight. An acquaintance remarked that I looked “faster” than ever, and a social media follower commented “You’re getting skinny girl!” While I think these comments were intended to be positive, I was a little surprised. I’ve always been adamant that we shouldn’t comment on anyone’s body, regardless of size, and have publicly asked people not to comment on my body. My weight loss was not intentional, and I had no desire to promote it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Navigating the social and personal ramifications of a visibly changing body is intense. I was once again reminded how poorly society treats fat people. Whereas before I was mostly invisible, I now get unsolicited cat-calling from men, people are way nicer, and my concerns are taken seriously at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;After a complication with my prescribing doctor and insurance, I have been off the medication since May 2025. My last dose was two weeks before Unbound Gravel, where I successfully rode 109 miles (and had to relearn all my eating strategies on the fly, as I was suddenly &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hungry!) Sadly, my joint pain and inflammation have come roaring back into my life, along with my appetite. And so my health struggles continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I hesitate to share this story as a leader in the body positive world. Other leaders have been vilified for losing weight (see Lizzo) and changing their bodies. As I’ve gone through this process, it’s only reinforced my belief that all bodies are good bodies, all bikes are good bikes, and all rides should be celebrated. Regardless of my weight or size, my values, my personality, and my love of cycling are the same. Whether I wear a size 22 or a size 14, I still believe that everyone should get to experience the joy of cycling, with equipment, clothing, and a community that supports them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I also believe you should do whatever feels right for you to live happily, healthily, and pain-free, and it’s truly no one’s business but yours and your health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve learned through this journey, it’s that health is not one-size-fits-all, and it’s never just about the number on the scale. The decisions we make about our bodies, our medical care, and our well-being are deeply personal, and often far more complex than they appear from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;I didn’t take a GLP-1 to become thin or fit into a narrower mold of what an athlete looks like: hell, I’m still considered “obese” by all measures. I did it to manage chronic pain, stay active and keep riding bikes. My story isn’t a prescription or a path for anyone else; it’s simply a reminder that we all deserve access to tools that help us feel good in our bodies, no matter what they look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re an elite athlete, be aware that semaglutide is currently on the WADA Monitoring Program. This means that while drugs like Ozempic are not currently banned by WADA, the agency is monitoring its use in sports to determine if it should be added to the Prohibited List in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But when the pediatrician walked in, the mood changed. “Praying?” she asked, her voice tight. The nurse and I stepped back while the pediatrician gently moved Maggie’s limbs, testing how much they could straighten or bend. While some tightness in the hips or knees can be normal for a newborn, Maggie’s joints were unusually tight and her limbs could not straighten all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The pediatrician pointed out the rounded soles of Maggie’s feet. “A handful of genetic conditions can cause the shape of her feet. Most of them are fatal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"science/genetics","type":"Keyword","title":"Genetics"},{"id":"society/children","type":"Keyword","title":"Children"},{"id":"media/social-media","type":"Keyword","title":"Social media"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/21/daughter-health-mystery-rare-genetic-disorder","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I stared at her, unable to process the word “fatal” in connection to the brand new, six-pound person I’d brought into this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the next seven days, I rarely slept. The children’s hospital put me up in a &lt;a href="https://rmhc.org/donate?c_src=paid&amp;amp;c_src2=25AORPMsearch_google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=skag&amp;amp;utm_medium=google&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=18137358842&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACRPtoQgoC6CZiFvnOViCEW5k9lpb&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3rnCBhBxEiwArN0QE9vNBl_qDYtTcGtcMgbBGoJllSmAiQTsnAcPX-fhBn2Civ-A3qUhPRoCbfIQAvD_BwE" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ronald McDonald house&lt;/a&gt; a mile away from the NICU, where Maggie had been transferred. Every three hours, I walked to the NICU to breastfeed and pump. I was anxious and scared, signing off on procedures and tests, and answering dozens of questions about my pregnancy, diet, lifestyle and family history. By the time Maggie left the hospital, she had been seen by neurology, genetics, internal medicine and orthopedics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then the results came: she had tested negative for the scary fatal conditions. The relief floored me. But she also tested negative for every other known diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Why are her joints stiff?” I asked her last doctor right before discharge. He shrugged and said, “We can only get to know her as an individual. Sometimes it is not a bad thing to see how unique each person really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I agreed that accepting my daughter’s differences was essential. But I worried that the physicians had missed something. For the next two months, I sat in front of the computer, flipping through Maggie’s 50-page medical chart and searching terms like “multiple joint contractures”, “vertical talus”, “high arched palate” and “micrognathia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eventually, I discovered pictures of children with similar limbs in medical journals and studies about arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC – an umbrella diagnosis describing infants born with multiple contracted joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I showed Maggie’s new pediatrician screenshots. The condition was incredibly rare, he said; in his 30-year career, he had met only three babies who looked like my daughter, all during his time as a military physician overseas. He referred us to the closest specialty clinic, which was five states away in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“She has a community. You just haven’t met them yet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I knew the trip would be daunting with an infant and Maggie’s two-year-old sibling in tow. But for the first time, I had some answers and knew where to look for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Six months later, Maggie and I arrived for her first appointment at the clinic. We saw five specialists, which took nine hours. Some mysteries were solved. I learned the term for her feet: “&lt;a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Congenital_Vertical_Talus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rocker bottom&lt;/a&gt;”, the soles curving like the bottoms of cartoon boats. Surgery could guide them to grow flatter and arched, so she could learn to bear weight and eventually walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since birth, Maggie’s elbows had loosened, but her knees still didn’t flex all the way. We would need to take annual weeks-long trips to Philadelphia so the doctors could slowly stretch Maggie’s ankles and knees, wrap them in casts, saw off the casts a week later, stretch a little farther, and cast again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, we had no diagnosis. “What caused all this?” I asked the doctors. I was afraid to voice my other questions: &lt;em&gt;Will she walk or talk? How different will she be from her sibling? What decisions will I have to make? How will I know what is right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the United States, parents of the one in six children &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/child-development/about/developmental-disability-basics.html#:~:text=1%20in%206%2C%20or%20about%2017%25%2C%20of%20children%20aged%203%20through%2017" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;with developmental delays&lt;/a&gt; ask such questions every day.

Some diagnoses, like Maggie’s, are so rare that &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/rare-and-orphan-diseases" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they aren’t seen as profitable subjects&lt;/a&gt; for research funding. People with these “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1502161" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;orphan conditions&lt;/a&gt;” have to rely on themselves, their families, and grassroots endeavors to fund and discover treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Navigating the maze of anxiety and “what ifs” felt relentless. Then I joined a Facebook group dedicated to the AMC specialist clinic we had visited, where parents shared pictures of their children, diagnoses, concerns, treatments and contact information for specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I introduced myself and posted pictures of Maggie. Immediately, Alyssa Wolfe, a mother and nurse, messaged me. She pointed out that her daughter, Delaney, had the same rocker bottom feet as Maggie, a rarity in the group. Our daughters both had one middle finger stuck flexed at the joint, and similar faces: a small chin, and a broad nose bridge that makes their eyes look farther apart than most babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4da723dd-340a-42ea-b464-5fbfd3c43211" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Maggie with her iPad, loaded with a program that she could use to talk.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Asha Dore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Delaney was three years older than Maggie. For years, I tracked Alyssa and Delaney’s progress through treatments, surgeries and diagnoses. Having another parent to talk to about major decisions was a huge relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen Donohoe, a physical therapist, was also in the group, as she worked with many children with arthrogryposis. She had been gathering stories from patients like Maggie and Delaney because they “were different from the others with AMC, but they had so many of the same characteristics, it was impossible to ignore”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa had met Maureen at an arthrogryposis conference before I joined the group. “In an elevator, Maureen approached me, listing off Delaney’s attributes. I asked her if she somehow read my child’s medical chart. Maureen told me, ‘No,’ but she had been hypothesizing with a geneticist about a syndrome, and she thought Delaney had it,” Alyssa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After coming across six patients with these characteristics, Maureen had told Dr Judith Hall, a clinical geneticist and pediatrician, this might be a genetic anomaly worth studying. “After Dr Hall looked at her own notes, she called me and said, ‘I have 10,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Connecting with Alyssa and Maureen was the first major step in identifying Maggie’s condition. But what was the next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As Maggie grew, her development continued to be markedly different from that of other kids her age. By the time she was three, she could scoot but not yet crawl. Most kids her age with AMC had been mobile for at least a year. But one day, in physical therapy, she suddenly stood with the help of a toy shopping cart. Then she learned to use a walker. Over the years Maureen noticed a similar trend with kids like Maggie. “They do their best weight-bearing and walking around preschool age,” she said. “When they get older, they seem to have a harder time maintaining a center of gravity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maggie was talking constantly, but her sounds were disorganized. Nobody could understand her. Most children with AMC alone had no speech problems at all. It was hard to find resources, but our speech therapist helped us get an iPad program that Maggie could use to talk. She’d press a button on a grid of images and common words, and the iPad would say the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her first sentence blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie was sitting at the dining room table eating breakfast while I washed dishes. “I need money,” her talker said in a mechanized child’s voice. I paused, holding a bowl. Maggie pressed the “talk” button again, and the sentence repeated. She pointed at my purse and threw her head back, guffawing. She’d made a joke. I said, “You need money!” over and over, laughing, nearly sobbing, dripping soapy water everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, Maggie was using her talker to ask for snacks and toys, to complain, to tell her new baby brother, “You’re cute!” At school, Maggie verbally repeated every word she or her friends pressed. By the end of the school year, the talker was gathering dust in our coat closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maggie’s limitations and sudden moments of progress surprised even the doctors who specialized in arthrogryposis. At every turn, I wanted to celebrate her success, but the gap widened between her and the other kids with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Isolating a genetic anomaly is a “diagnostic odyssey” that many families embark on, said Dr Michael Bamshad, head of genetic medicine in pediatrics at the University of Washington. “There’s all this data that sits locked away in medical records. A physician in one state may know of three similar cases, a physician in another state may know about five,” said Bamshad, “but there aren’t many ways for those families to find each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bamshad, his colleague Jessica X Chong and their colleagues have researched &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26656649/#:~:text=Methods:%20Social%20networking%20among%20families%2C%20clinicians%2C%20and,conditions%2C%20particularly%20those%20with%20nonspecific%20phenotypic%20features." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the power of social media in genetic discovery&lt;/a&gt;. They launched a secure, free genetic information sharing site, &lt;a href="https://mygene2.org/MyGene2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MyGene2&lt;/a&gt;, in 2016. “Families and clinicians can share their genetic information to help them find answers,” said Chong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alyssa and I input our daughters’ data and hoped for more information. But the waiting game was long, and we felt powerless. Alyssa recently described it to me as a three-part process: “In the beginning, parents are typically very active on social media, trying to understand their kid and hoping to give them as normal of a life as possible,” she said. Then, “sometime in elementary or middle school, their development stalls” and the focus shifts from “fixing” the issue to maintenance through puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can all be “very isolating”, she said. “Parents with typically developing kids often stop hanging out with you.” But “an acceptance stage” can come via social media groups like ours, which are “sometimes the only place to find connection and friends who understand”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 2017, Catherine Paul-Fijten, a mother and molecular biologist who lives in Dubai, used Facebook groups to connect with parents whose kids resembled her daughter, Milou. I didn’t know about Milou yet, but she had the same physical traits as Maggie, who was five by then. Milou’s doctors had located a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/For-Patients-and-Families/Genetic-Disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;difference&lt;/a&gt; on the ZC4H2 gene shortly after birth, and Catherine organized a meeting of doctors and geneticists – including Maureen and Dr Bamshad – to review the current, albeit limited, research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maureen sat next to Bamshad, scrolling through pictures of Maggie, Delaney and other children with rocker bottom feet and tiny chins. Bamshad suggested that we both report our daughter’s symptoms on MyGene2 and apply for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within a year, the diagnosis was confirmed: Maggie also had an anomaly of the ZC4H2 gene. At the time, fewer than 50 people with a similar genetic difference had ever been identified. Catherine used personal resources to start a foundation to research the impacts of this new genetic diagnosis, updating a new, dedicated Facebook group regularly with insights. The diagnosis gave us a sense of belonging through the shared goal of understanding our kids and learning how to help them grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The dramatic impact of online support groups for children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470259/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5350458/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; for more than 20 years. Online information sharing among parents has been found to strengthen treatment and mental health support &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998788/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316198/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;families &lt;/a&gt;and children with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15658796/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;neurologic disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769721213001092?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; rare &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt; as well as more common diagnoses like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647109/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jpedres.org/articles/how-parents-of-children-with-cancer-seek-information-through-online-communities-a-netnography-study/doi/jpr.galenos.2019.48378?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;childhood cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the ZC4H2 gene difference is rare, research into rare conditions is crucial – “not just for the people who have that diagnosis – but for humanity as a whole”, Catherine said. That’s because “much of what we know about the function of the human genome comes from understanding the genetic basis of rare diseases”, said Bamshad, citing examples including common heart conditions and vaccine research. “What we’ve learned about rare diseases helps us understand the genetic and molecular basis of common conditions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The ZC4H2 group has nearly 200 members, though nearly 250 people with this condition have now been identified globally. Because of their stories, I was prepared. In 2023, at the beginning of sixth grade, Maggie suddenly presented with severe scoliosis, and I knew she would probably need a full spinal fusion because I’d heard about related complications from our ZC4H2 community. I shared this information with Maggie’s spinal surgeon, as well as a list of other surgeons who had had to manage these complications, and she formed a pre-emptive plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;During Maggie’s spinal surgery, I let myself get lost in the labyrinthian halls of the hospital for hours, cellphone in one hand, operating room pager in the other. As with her previous 10-plus surgeries, I didn’t allow myself to imagine what was happening or what could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As I stood in the hallway, I scrolled through encouraging comments and messages from Alyssa, Catherine and others. Despite our different jobs, family culture and background, we’d collaborated with doctors, scientists, physical and speech therapists – and each other – for more than a decade. Their support didn’t guarantee a perfect future for my daughter, but their generosity was a profound gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The operating room pager went off. My phone rang. The charge nurse told me my daughter was waking up, that surgery had been a breeze. I rushed to the recovery room, tapping the app to share the news while I waited for Maggie to be wheeled in. At the top of the feed, a new member had posted about her child’s fresh diagnosis, her questions, her fears. I abandoned my own update to type the words that changed the course of my life and Maggie’s childhood: &lt;em&gt;Welcome! You are not alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 16:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQX1ZXR3RjS1M5b25oWkd0QW85QldnblBXVmZsQlB2S2FFbkREazl6d3luc3Yya0wwRlYwbmpMRWZKZG5oTnNWelFwTmFqN2JaREptMGNIS2t3SXdHMjFidmk0V1dTMjhGRkFUMEJkbjhCeU9yeHN0U05reU9CYkJyYjVFM1VxYUNYenBxMEt4T3QwSjNoTUpZNUln</guid></item><item><title>在主要新研究中发现的四种生物学上不同的自闭症类型- Earth.com | Four biologically distinct types of autism discovered in major new study - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPU0hXdzltR1hfTlR6U0lmQk4xRS0yY3lqWWFZV082bUNrUmh3eEREQzQ2WjRGYjVLLXhsUnNMY0RrcWVmdVI1MzFjSkUtaWlzeWlIR1p3THN4TFAwSFdrZ1NBVkt0TmYzbVlYRDZLQjYybjN0QlV3WHR3N2plQThIRl9mZkpOWDRudkVEVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder has long challenged both science and medicine. Each type presents differently – from speech delays to social difficulties to repetitive behaviors – making it hard to define and diagnose in a clear, unified way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, clinicians, and researchers have often worked with uncertainty, relying on broad categories that mask the condition’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;complexity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simons Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have reshaped our understanding of autism. They identified four distinct clinical and biological subtypes using data from over 5,000 children in the SPARK autism cohort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift toward a person-centered view may change how autism is diagnosed and treated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autism-types-mapped-with-big-data"&gt;Autism types mapped with big data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of linking individual traits to single genes, the team used a computational model that considered each child’s entire profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed over 230 traits per child – spanning developmental milestones, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toddler-screen-time-linked-to-atypical-sensory-behaviors/"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; challenges, and repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed them to group individuals into categories that reflect meaningful differences in both behavior and biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the genetics of autism is essential for revealing the biological mechanisms that contribute to the condition, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis,” said Olga Troyanskaya, senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-four-distinct-autism-types-emerge"&gt;Four distinct autism types emerge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study defined four categories of autism. The Social and Behavioral Challenges group includes children with classic autism traits but typical developmental progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group features children who reach milestones later but often lack anxiety or disruptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moderate Challenges group has milder autism traits, no delays, and few psychiatric &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-brain-learns-study-reveals-an-unexpected-twist/"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt;. The Broadly Affected group shows a wide range of severe symptoms including delays, repetitive behaviors, and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are powerful because the classes represent different clinical presentations and outcomes, and critically we were able to connect them to distinct underlying biology,” said Aviya Litman, Ph.D. student at Princeton and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-clues-behind-autism-types"&gt;Genetic clues behind autism types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional genetic testing explains only a small portion of autism cases. This study went further by revealing distinct genetic profiles for each subtype. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broadly Affected group showed the highest rate of damaging mutations not inherited from parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group had more rare inherited variants. Though the two groups share some traits, their genetic origins differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While genetic testing is already part of the standard of care for people diagnosed with autism, thus far, this testing reveals variants that explain the autism of only about 20% of patients,” said Jennifer Foss-Feig of the Simons Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study begins to bridge that gap by offering a clearer map of which variants relate to which traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings point to specific hypotheses linking various pathways to different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; of autism,” said Litman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developmental-timing-matters"&gt;Developmental timing matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic influences behind each subtype do not act at the same time in development. In children with social and behavioral challenges, key gene mutations become active after birth. This matches the clinical picture of late diagnosis without early developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, children in the Mixed ASD group carry mutations that affect the brain during fetal development. These genetic timelines correspond to the children’s milestones, diagnoses, and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating genetic and clinical data at scale, we can now begin to map the trajectory of autism,” said Chandra Theesfeld of Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-direction-for-autism-research"&gt;New direction for autism research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification of autism types builds on years of collaborative research and was made possible through integration across genetics, psychology, and computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of Princeton Precision Health’s mission to connect biological insight with clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a whole new paradigm, to provide these groups as a starting point for investigating the genetics of autism,” said Theesfeld. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of searching for one common cause of autism, researchers can now examine the distinct mechanisms behind each group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Sauerwald, co-lead author, explained, “The ability to define biologically meaningful autism subtypes is foundational to realizing the vision of precision medicine for neurodevelopmental conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-families"&gt;What this means for families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, this research may offer new clarity and direction. Knowing a child’s autism subtype could help with planning school support, medical care, and therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding genetic causes for more individuals with autism could lead to more targeted developmental monitoring, precision treatment, and tailored support and accommodations at school or work,” said Foss-Feig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families may gain insight into what symptoms to expect and how to better plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-autism-model-can-work-for-other-issues"&gt;Autism model can work for other issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study focused on autism, its methods may apply to other complex conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining clinical traits with genetic data, researchers can now identify clear subtypes where once there was only disorder-level confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to countless new scientific and clinical discoveries,” said Theesfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:22:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPU0hXdzltR1hfTlR6U0lmQk4xRS0yY3lqWWFZV082bUNrUmh3eEREQzQ2WjRGYjVLLXhsUnNMY0RrcWVmdVI1MzFjSkUtaWlzeWlIR1p3THN4TFAwSFdrZ1NBVkt0TmYzbVlYRDZLQjYybjN0QlV3WHR3N2plQThIRl9mZkpOWDRudkVEVQ</guid></item><item><title>第二次世界大战产生的原子废料的小溪与癌症风险增加有关- NPR | A creek with atomic waste from WWII is linked to increased cancer risk - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxNMGhMVFEwZnY1ZENfUW9FVTBTejUwUmFuTXVNOXYyd3hhMlh3b1NGSlUzRXVLZjktQkFTZE1UY1o2OU9CcTBtaURNWEZpbGZheGZ4NldEeVd0MkJXOXp6SFlWT0wyUEFnNkdLMlNnS1N3V0NyeWl4dzhqVFlkeEt6ZlRMUnIzOWFaLTlEc3ZFQWhSYkRHWkhmenlFQ2VnbnppT3pCN0RKbDliMEdRT0w3RjNELVFJQWYyX0NFLS1DQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Children who lived near a St. Louis creek polluted with radioactive atomic bomb waste from the 1940s through the 1960s were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetimes than children who lived farther from the waterway, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836420" target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open, &lt;/em&gt;corroborate worries that &lt;a href="https://www.stlpr.org/health-science-environment/2025-04-01/st-louis-coldwater-creek-residents-federal-compensation" target="_blank"&gt;neighbors of Coldwater Creek&lt;/a&gt; have long held about the Missouri River tributary where generations of children played.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We actually saw something quite dramatic, not only elevated risk of cancer, but one that increased steadily in a sort of dose-response manner the closer the childhood residents got to Coldwater Creek," said the study's senior author, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/marc-weisskopf/" target="_blank"&gt;Marc Weisskopf,&lt;/a&gt; an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of the Manhattan Project, &lt;a href="https://moenvironment.org/blog/brief-history-of-radioactivity-in-st-louis/" target="_blank"&gt;Mallinckrodt Chemical Works&lt;/a&gt; processed uranium in St. Louis for the development of an atomic bomb. By the mid-1940s, according to historians, the company began to haul its radioactive waste north of the city, leaving it in open steel drums, unattended and exposed to the elements, next to Coldwater Creek.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The study's release comes shortly after passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" which contained a &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-passes-reca-secures-new-medicaid-funding-in-senate-reconciliation-bill/__;!!Iwwt!RpIk0hm2iuov0N-Cy-QCKvDHyND1ZkmXa57Pi4rgJ3Y-LTKdWcSVMAsVpL-a5cpxucqHkavllw61dklvBFU$" target="_blank"&gt;little-known provision&lt;/a&gt; to help people sickened by exposure to nuclear waste in Missouri and elsewhere. It provides &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3853/text#:~:text=%E2%80%9C(c)%20Payments%20to%20beneficiaries,shares%20to%20each%20surviving%20child." target="_blank"&gt;payments of $25,000&lt;/a&gt; to families of people who died as a result of &lt;a href="https://knpr.org/2025-07-09/radiation-exposure-compensation-act-is-renewed" target="_blank"&gt;radiation-linked cancers in the St. Louis area&lt;/a&gt; and $50,000 to those who developed the cancers and survived.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Like the new study, the provision recognizes the potential health risks from lower radiation levels associated with the production of the atomic bomb. Previous legislation, the &lt;a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43956.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Radiation Exposure Compensation Act&lt;/a&gt;, known as RECA, expired last year after paying out $2.6 billion to people who developed cancer after exposure to high-dose radiation from participating in onsite atomic weapon testing, mining or hauling uranium or being downwind of the Nevada test site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78520" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, made sure the RECA reauthorization was included in the recently passed budget bill and that it included benefits for his constituents who lived near the contaminated creek.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, pushed to get a new version of RECA into the Trump budget bill. Hawley had been a vocal critic of the BBB's $900 billion cut to Medicaid, but in the end voted for the massive package of tax and spending cuts. Hawley's yes vote came after a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added to the BBB. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Research treasure trove: Decades-old baby teeth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Weisskopf and his research team had the addresses of 4,209 tooth donors from the St. Louis Baby Tooth Survey. Participants, born between 1945 and 1966, donated their baby teeth for science starting in 1958 and joined the new experiment between 2021 and 2024. Weisskopf initially planned to study cognitive decline, but after participants repeatedly mentioned Coldwater Creek, he pivoted to investigating proximity to the creek and cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Almost one-quarter of the participants reported having cancer. Those who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children were 44% more likely to report having cancer than those who lived more than 20 kilometers away. Even more striking, those who lived within one kilometer of the creek were 85% more likely to have radiosensitive cancers, cancers believed to be caused by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/smith-bindman.rebecca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman,&lt;/a&gt; a radiologist and epidemiology professor at the University of California, said she was impressed with the design of the study, with which she was not involved. "This study adds to our understanding that radiation is carcinogenic and that we have to be cautious to minimize exposures to radiation wherever possible," she said. The main source of exposure today comes from medical imaging, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the need to clean up areas, like shipyards, with radioactive waste, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A behavioral difference for boys?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Male study participants were more likely than female participants to develop cancer, Smith-Bindman noted. She and Weisskopf hypothesized that the boys were more likely to play in Coldwater Creek in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1958, scientists at Washington University began collecting the &lt;a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/stories/tooth-fairy-goes-scientific" target="_blank"&gt;baby teeth&lt;/a&gt; of children from St. Louis. The teeth were used in studies investigating possible links between cancer and the fallout from nuclear tests in the western U.S. St. Louis was chosen not because of its connection to uranium production but because milk in the Midwest had some of the nation's highest levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;High concentrations of strontium-90 found in donated baby teeth contributed to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21319726/" target="_blank"&gt;A 2011 study&lt;/a&gt; found that men who were children in St. Louis in the 1960s and died of cancer by middle age had more than twice as much radioactive strontium in their baby teeth as men who grew up nearby and were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Though he did not use the baby teeth in his current study, Weisskopf would like to measure strontium-90 in the teeth in a future study to assess cancer risk and actual exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As boys, they might have played in the creek way more than girls, and so they got much more exposure," he said. "If that were the case, then the radiation in the teeth should be higher in the boys than in the girls."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given that the half-life of strontium-90 is 29 years, Weisskopf is eager to begin work on a more detailed study while radiation remains in the baby teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In anti-vaccine communities, it may quickly find a foothold and spread largely under the radar before ballooning into an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/texas","type":"Keyword","title":"Texas"},{"id":"society/mmr","type":"Keyword","title":"MMR"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/melody-schreiber","type":"Contributor","title":"Melody Schreiber"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-news","type":"Tracking","title":"US News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/jul/21/anti-vaxxer-measles-texas","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Brian Hooker, chief scientific officer of Children’s Health Defense, filmed an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/measles-spread-vaccine-misinformation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas in March with the parents of the six-year-old child who died from measles – the first measles death in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The video promoted several dangerous myths about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, a virus that can be deadly and can cause lifelong harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker and Polly Tommey, an anti-vaccine film-maker with Children’s Health Defense, also interviewed other Mennonite families in west Texas. And they visited the medical office of Ben Edwards while patients and Edwards himself had symptomatic measles, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker then traveled home to Redding, California, and developed measles symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Full disclosure, 18 days after visiting Seminole, Texas, sitting in a measles clinic and being exposed to Doctor Ben with the measles, I got the measles. So cool,” Hooker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker, Tommey, and Edwards spoke on a &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6tml4t-episode-178-measles-outbreak-update.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by anti-vaccine activist Steve Kirsch on May 22. This news has not been previously reported by other outlets. Children’s Health Defense did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiry for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker doesn’t appear to have sought healthcare or testing to confirm his symptoms were measles and not another infection. Other viral and bacterial infections may cause rashes, which is why medical providers need to conduct tests to confirm measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Without confirmation of his illness being measles, Hooker may spread misinformation about the illness – including what helps to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker says he turned to the alternative treatments hailed by anti-vaccine activists. Edwards had given him cod liver oil and vitamin C supplements in Gaines county, Hooker said, noting: “I stuck them in my luggage, and that’s what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And if this case was measles, by not seeking confirmation testing and notifying officials, Hooker may have contributed to onward spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s not clear if his first symptoms appeared after 18 days, or if he developed other symptoms – runny nose, cough, fever, watery eyes – and then a rash after 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After a person is exposed to measles, the virus usually incubates for 11 to 12 days before respiratory symptoms appear, followed by a rash two to four days later. A person is considered infectious four days before the rash appears and remains infectious until four days after it fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If Hooker’s illness was measles, “it sounds like my worst nightmare as an infectious disease doc,” said Peter Chin-Hong, professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at University of California San Francisco. “For all we know, there’s a trail of measles, like bread crumbs in Hansel and Gretel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In areas with no known cases, health providers might not immediately suspect measles, he said: “Many people probably didn’t know they had it. There could have been people who were ill with pneumonia, who went into the hospital and no one diagnosed it. It’s very, very hard to diagnose because we haven’t seen that much of it. But of course, we’re seeing a lot more of it now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are other indications that the actual number of cases from the Texas outbreak is higher than the official count, Chin-Hong said – with three confirmed deaths, experts might expect a case count closer to 3,000, instead of the 762 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and 95 cases in &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, medical providers alert local or state health officials when a patient tests positive for measles. Health officials then conduct contact tracing to notify anyone who came into contact with the patient, including other travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A representative for the Shasta county health department, serving the area where Hooker &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-hooker-ph-d-p-e-8918348/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he lives, said there have been no confirmed cases of measles reported this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are no cases of measles in Shasta county, and we have had no notice of any confirmed cases of measles this year,” said Jules Howard, community education specialist with the Shasta County Health &amp;amp; Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to know when a region has even a single case so resources can be diverted to the area to stop transmission, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most important part of those efforts is contact tracing and vaccinating anyone who is vulnerable – especially infants, pregnant people, and immune-compromised people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker is a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine community. He testified on Tuesday before a US Senate committee in its first-ever “vaccine injury” hearing, attempting to link MMR vaccination to autism – despite several studies showing no relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hooker said he became sick with measles despite being vaccinated as a child. But because he was born before 1989, he probably only received one dose of the MMR vaccine, which is 93% effective at stopping illness. Vaccination may also make breakthrough illness milder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When anti-vaccine messages keep parents from getting their children vaccinated, “I think the damage is immediate,” Chin-Hong said, before adding that it “goes beyond the measles outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other vaccine-preventable illnesses like whooping cough and the flu are also surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is like the poster child, but it’s about a way of life that we’ve taken for granted in the last few decades that is threatened,” Chin-Hong said. “The fact that [they] are questioning it on a public stage means that a lot more people who might have trusted their clinicians are questioning it more now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US eliminated measles in 2000, but the nation could lose that status if there is sustained transmission for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re going back in time,” Chin-Hong said. “We have to relearn all of these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9UaXdVdmtRb3I4ZERCLXplcTJXMFNPZkVWd2IzSWxELXdjRVQyME8xM0tVbVZDclFJRUpQTHRPZGxRVFA4V05ycUhhR2xYYS1vVUtQQUZlRWhIVU1jRmdMZ2ZNbWNvVy1HeC12eGtpWXlHTVRMRXJ1bkM3Y1NtUQ</guid></item><item><title>抗癌药物能否成为阿尔茨海默氏症治疗的未来？ -雅虎主页 | Could cancer drugs be the future of Alzheimer's treatment? - Yahoo Home</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNU3JmM0NjeUY1aVhZdHBZUk5Ca1A1RjBIbEhyLVN1d2tWSzh5Z1VCc2h3NXV0RVpCTmh1ZlRVc3lNYTQtSVN0M1RDQTVYRHo2d1Y4Qk16ZjZUc3BraFk0V1VMcTNtWkNGNlZHaW95THFwYlVZUHRaVmZ3X0lzZjFKUi1Bbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With few treatments available to stop or reverse Alzheimer’s disease, scientists have turned to cancer drugs as a potential means of walking back cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s cases are rising in the United States and worldwide due to an aging population, but there is no cure for the disease. Attempts to develop new treatments that slow the disease’s progress, rather than lessen symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-alzheimers-drugs-keep-scientists-shift-focus-rcna40288" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have frequently failed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;have frequently failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Only two drugs — the antibody therapies Leqembi and Kisunla — are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow the progression of early Alzheimer’s, and scientists say their benefits are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some pharmaceutical companies have halted or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biogen-stop-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-rcna136619" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:abandoned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; their Alzheimer’s drug development programs because of unsuccessful trials. Others are trying to use existing medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/eli-lilly-to-take-big-swings-in-alzheimers-als-and-gene-therapy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:popular weight loss drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;popular weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, to combat Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With that in mind, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a broad search for drugs that could be repurposed to treat the condition — in theory, reducing the time in which the drugs could be made available to patients. They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published Monday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’ database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In &lt;span&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/span&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy.

Attempts to develop new treatments that slow the disease’s progress, rather than lessen symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-alzheimers-drugs-keep-scientists-shift-focus-rcna40288" target="_blank"&gt;have frequently failed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-256e5f" class="body-graf"&gt;Only two drugs — the antibody therapies Leqembi and Kisunla — are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow the progression of early Alzheimer’s, and scientists say their benefits are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d7948" class="body-graf"&gt;Some pharmaceutical companies have halted or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biogen-stop-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-rcna136619" target="_blank"&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; their Alzheimer’s drug development programs because of unsuccessful trials. Others are trying to use existing medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/eli-lilly-to-take-big-swings-in-alzheimers-als-and-gene-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;popular weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, to combat Alzheimer’s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28236e" class="body-graf"&gt;With that in mind, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a broad search for drugs that could be repurposed to treat the condition — in theory, reducing the time in which the drugs could be made available to patients.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They scoured a database of more than 1,300 drugs of various classes, including antipsychotics, antibiotics, antifungals and chemotherapy drugs. Then, they looked at how those drugs affected gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a6385" class="body-graf"&gt;Their new study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Cell, identified two cancer drugs&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as the best candidates to lower Alzheimer’s risk in patients. When combined, the drugs seemed to slow or reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice. One of the drugs is normally used to treat breast cancer, while the other is effective against colon and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66ce04" class="body-graf"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant changes in the way genes are expressed in the brain, leading to the increased production of certain proteins and the decreased production of others. These imbalances may disrupt brain function and contribute to symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5fb8e" class="body-graf"&gt;Fewer than 90 drugs in the researchers’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;database reversed the expression of signature Alzheimer’s-related genes in human brain cells. And five drugs in particular seemed to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in actual patients, based on electronic medical records. The authors ultimately selected two of those drugs, both approved by the FDA to treat cancer, to test in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e3b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We didn’t expect cancer drugs to come up” as the most promising, said Marina Sirota, a co-author of the study and interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed88b1" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors said the breast cancer drug letrozole seemed to change gene expression in nerve cells. And the colon and lung cancer drug irinotecan seemed to change gene expression in glial cells, which support the nervous system. Alzheimer’s can destroy nerve cells and cause glial cells to proliferate, creating inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd94e7" class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="http://letrozole" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer patients who received letrozole were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than patients who did not receive the drug. Colorectal cancer survivors treated with irinotecan also had a decreased Alzheimer’s risk, according to &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00729" target="_blank"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53b57b" class="body-graf"&gt;After testing the drugs in mice, the study authors found that the two-drug combo reversed brain degeneration and improved memory in mice that had developed hallmarks of Alzheimer’s as they aged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9763dd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because results in mice often don’t translate to humans, the researchers hope to test the drugs in a clinical trial with Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73ee98" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developing a new drug can take hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars, on average take more than 10 years. For this repurposed drug, usually it just takes two or three years, and then you can go to the clinical trial and the cost is much, much lower,” said Dr. Yadong Huang, a co-author of the study and professor of neurology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90acd4" class="body-graf"&gt;“We still haven’t generated or produced any very effective drugs that can really slow dramatically the cognitive decline,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f27e1b" class="body-graf"&gt;Part of the difficulty in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s is the complexity of the disease. Its exact cause is largely unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62e31c" class="body-graf"&gt;For now, the authors said, it’s unclear exactly why the cancer drugs seem to work against Alzheimer’s. One theory is that the breast cancer drug blocks the production of estrogen, a hormone that controls the expression of a large number of genes. The colon and lung cancer drug may also block inflammation in the brain by preventing the proliferation of glial cells — though Huang said there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986e4" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Melanie McReynolds, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study, offered another theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ab613" class="body-graf"&gt;Her &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6131" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that a different type of cancer drug could help treat Alzheimer’s by regulating glucose metabolism, the process by which cells make energy. McReynolds said the process is necessary for various brain cells to communicate with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-754b37" class="body-graf"&gt;“With aging, with stress, with diseases, that line of communication is disrupted,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-671ed8" class="body-graf"&gt;McReynolds said the drug combo tested in the new study might reverse metabolic decline — what she called “the secret for contributing to better outcomes with Alzheimer’s.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ea4a6" class="body-graf"&gt;But assessing how Alzheimer’s patients tolerate the combination of cancer drugs will be important.

From the backyard to hiking trails, Texans are being chomped on by ticks, and some of those bites and lead to very serious, sometimes even debilitating illness. Let's take a closer look at what's behind the surge in tick activity, and what we can do to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rise in Tick Activity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keranews.org/health-wellness/2025-07-21/tick-activity-higher-in-texas-this-season-heres-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;Dr. Michael Allen&lt;/a&gt; from UNT's Health Science Center says the influx of Lyme disease reports is due in part to the fact that Texas experiences a relatively wet spring and summer, with heat that wasn't quite as oppressive as is typical, which led to the survival of ticks from winter months through til summer. Contrary to popular belief, Lyme disease is a massive concern in the United States with roughly half a million cases reported each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-erik-karits-r6PynlurQ2M-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Erik Karits on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@erik_karits?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Erik Karits&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-small-black-insect-sitting-on-top-of-a-persons-finger-r6PynlurQ2M?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease: What To Know&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2825/"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; is caused when bacteria are transmitted from a deer tick, and may cause symptoms that affect the skin, nervous system, heart, and/or joints of a person. It can affect people of any age, but people who spend more time in grassy or wooded environments are especially at risk of exposure. Not every tick bite will give you Lyme disease, and in most cases, a tick must be attached 36 hours or more before it transmits bacteria to you. Lyme disease cannot be spread from person to person, and transference to the fetus of a pregnant woman is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read More: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://kfmx.com/ixp/190/p/lubbock-bee-swarm-response/?utm_source=tsmclip&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Bee Infestation Causes Stings In South Lubbock Neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-marino-linic-M_krTMIPSLg-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Marino Linic on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@marinolinic?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Marino Linic&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-holding-a-small-bug-M_krTMIPSLg?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 to 80 percent of Lyme disease cases begin with a solid patch rash, roughly 2 inches in diameter, that appears around or near the site of the bite. In some cases, there will be multiple rashes. Early signs of the disease include headache, fever/chills, stiff neck, swollen glands, and muscle/joint pain. If the disease goes untreated in the early stage, it can become much more severe. As Lyme disease progresses, untreated, it is characterized by severe fatigue, stiff aching neck, numbness and tingling sensations in the arms and legs, and even facial paralysis. Sometimes, this array of symptoms doesn't appear for weeks, months, or even years after the tick bite. It's important to seek medical treatment immediately if you think you may have contracted Lyme disease. With antibiotics, it's almost always fully curable. However, the chances to completely cure the disease will decrease if treatment is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-image "&gt;&lt;figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone"&gt;&lt;p class="frame-sizer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theframe" data-image="https://townsquare.media/site/157/files/2025/07/attachment-erik-karits-bHwrqIAwBF8-unsplash.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Photo by Erik Karits on Unsplash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@erik_karits?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Erik Karits&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-persons-skin-with-a-spider-on-it-bHwrqIAwBF8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lyme Disease Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer ticks love moist areas that are shady and right around ground level. They cling to tall grass, shrubs, and bushes, waiting for a passing animal to drop onto. Once a tick reaches your skin, it typically climbs upward, looking for protected areas to latch onto. After you've spent time outdoors, be sure to check all of your most private areas for the little critters. They are very light and small, and often go unnoticed as they walk across your body. Wear light-colored clothing to easily spot them and consider tucking your pants into your socks or boots when you're out in thick grass and brush. Use insect repellent and avoid sitting directly on the ground or stone walls, and keep your hair pulled back, especially when doing things like gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep scrolling for more Texas-based news in the galleries below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Deadly Texas: The Lone Star State's Most Dangerous Insects &amp;amp; Arachnids &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encounters with Texas insects can be magical (think flights of Monarch butterflies!), but mostly they tend to be neutral or negative.

Fibroblasts (the skin cells that make collagen) become less active and collagen production becomes less efficient. This process typically begins in your thirties, varies by ethnicity, and speeds up by &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a62119063/menopause-skincare-guide/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="menopause" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And that's not all: On top of the natural degradation of this essential building block, the onslaught of daily life and certain lifestyle habits also take their toll. “Collagen is constantly being broken down by sun exposure, environmental stressors, and enzymes within the body,” says Dr. Shah. Free radicals, unstable molecules generated by UV radiation and pollution attack and degrade the protein. And certain lifestyle factors aren't helping matters: smoking and a high-sugar diet can all affect our stores of collagen. “Less obvious contributors include chronic stress, poor sleep, and environmental pollution,” Dr. Shah adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The result: a gradual loss of skin structure, leading to wrinkles, rough texture, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43386802/how-to-minimize-pores-dermatologist-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="enlarged pores" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;enlarged pores&lt;/a&gt;, crepey skin, and increased fragility, often experienced as easy bruising, says Dr. Shah. The early signs of collagen loss often show around &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a63371746/under-eye-skincare-routine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the eyes" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;the eyes&lt;/a&gt;, mouth (even in non-smokers), and forehead—typically areas where there’s a lot of expression from facial movement. By our forties and fifties, “fine lines deepen due to continued collagen and elastin loss and compounded by a loss of bone and fat in the cheeks and jawline, causing sagging around the jowls and neck,” says Dr. Kseniya Kobets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Basically, when collagen dips, your features look a less snatched.&lt;br data-node-id="13.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="happily-there-is-skincare-that-can-help" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Happily, there is skincare that can help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Now, some good news: you &lt;em data-node-id="15.1"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; protect what you have. “The most effective approach involves minimizing collagen breakdown by maintaining a nutrient-rich diet, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64524158/best-sunscreen-ingredients/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wearing SPF 30" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;wearing SPF 30&lt;/a&gt; or higher daily, and incorporating proven ingredients such as retinoids, antioxidants, and peptides into your skincare routine,” Dr. Kobets says.

First, start with lighter serums like vitamin C, then apply heavier creams or oils. Retinoids should be used at night and introduced gradually. “I like to layer vitamin C in the morning followed by sunscreen, and retinoids in the evening,” says Dr. Libby. “Peptides and moisturizers like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46803777/hyaluronic-acid-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;hyaluronic acid&lt;/a&gt; can be layered with both for additional hydration and repair.” &lt;br data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-your-dermatologist-can-help" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;How your dermatologist can help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In-office treatments can help stimulate collagen production through controlled injury or thermal energy, which activates the body's own wound healing response, stimulating fibroblasts to churn out more collagen. “As your skin heals from these minor injuries, the resulting collagen fills in wrinkles, scars, and enlarged pores, improving skin texture and firmness,” says Dr. Kobets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The right treatment depends on a patient’s skin concerns, age, and skin condition, says Dr. Libby. “Younger patients in their 20s and 30s may be advised to focus on prevention and early maintenance with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39817747/glycolic-acid-peel/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chemical peels" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chemical peels&lt;/a&gt; and lighter &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a34494967/laser-skin-tightening/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="laser skin tightening" data-node-id="31.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;laser skin tightening&lt;/a&gt;. While patients in their forties and beyond may benefit from more corrective treatments like ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and radiofrequency to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Here's what our experts recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="33" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0.0"&gt;Chemical Peels:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-depth chemical peels (like Jessner’s) use a blend of acids to remove the outermost layers of skin. They work primarily on the skin’s surface, but can also stimulate collagen remodeling below. These are most suitable for younger patients with minimal collagen loss, says Dr. Libby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Laser Resurfacing:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients in their forties and beyond may benefit more from ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers. “These treatments partially ablate and heat the skin to trigger collagen repair and remodeling,” says Dr. Kobets. Examples include C02 lasers (ablative) and Fraxel (non-ablative), and Halo (both). “Ablative fractional lasers or ultrasound and RF therapy to address existing collagen loss and sagging,” adds Dr. Libby.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.2.0"&gt;Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; “Microneedling mechanically penetrates the dermis to stimulate collagen formation,” Dr. Kobets says. “It can be enhanced by combining it with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which reduces downtime and further boosts collagen synthesis.” Derived from your own blood, PRP contains growth factors that can speed both healing and results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Radiofrequency Microneedling:&lt;/strong&gt; These cutting-edge treatments like the famoust Morpheus8 intensifies the traditional microneedling with heat-based energy.  “It promotes deeper collagen remodeling through both physical injury and heat,” Dr. Kobets says, making it especially effective for skin tightening and deeper wrinkles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.0"&gt;Ultrasound Device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.1"&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;: For a non-invasive option, devices like Sofwave rely on focused heat to stimulate collagen deep below the surface. “This heat breaks down old collagen and signals the body to produce fresh collagen while clearing out the damaged matrix. The result is firmer, tighter skin over several weeks,” says Dr. Kobets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.5.0"&gt;Biostimular Fillers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a39465647/botox-vs-fillers/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Injectible fillers" data-node-id="33.5.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Injectible fillers&lt;/a&gt; can stimulate collagen production over time. “ Sculptra and Radiesse are the probably the best ways to build collagen locally,” says Dr. Lal.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-build-collagen-through-diet" data-node-id="34" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;Can you build collagen through diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Eating collagen doesn’t rebuild collagen, so you can’t exactly replace what’s been lost in your face through your diet. But you &lt;em data-node-id="35.1"&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;support your skin with what you eat. One essential nutrient to overall skin health, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to research" data-node-id="35.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;, is vitamin C, “which helps your body build strong collagen by activating enzymes that stabilize and form it,” says Dr.  Kobets. “Without enough of this vitamin, collagen formation is impaired—scurvy is a good example of this.” Citrus fruits, bell peppers, and leafy greens are all excellent sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While collagen-rich foods like bone broth and gelatin are often praised, they’re not broken down in a way that specifically targets the skin. “Because these proteins are distributed throughout the body once digested, they don’t necessarily reach the skin directly,” she adds. Also watch the sugar, which can cause a collagen-damaging process known as glycation. “Glycation is essentially when sugar interacts with collagen, creating a modified form of collagen called advanced glycation end products or AGEs, which are stiffer, less pliable, and break down faster than healthy collagen,” says Dr. Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-collagen-creams-and-supplements" data-node-id="37" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;What about collagen creams and supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Much has been said about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of taking &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a44717102/collagen-supplements-environmental-impact/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oral collagen supplements" data-node-id="38.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;oral collagen supplements&lt;/a&gt; to help improve the appearance of your skin. So what does the science say? They can help, but “not all collagens are alike,” says Dr. Lal. “Verisol collagen supplementation has been shown to improve skin quality which often translates to reducing collagen breakdown.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In fact, one study of more than 100 women ranging in age from 45-65 years old found that taking a Verisol collagen supplement experienced a statistically significant increase in collagen and elastin in skin that resulted in a significant reduction in eye wrinkle volume.

But are you really expected to go full days without eating &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;? Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though its name suggests completely going without food every other day, studies on ADF typically involve eating about 25 percent of your usual intake one day, followed by a “feast day” of eating as much food as you like. The daily see-saw approach is still restrictive, yet for some, there’s appeal to a diet that doesn’t tell you what you can and can’t eat, doesn’t require macro tracking, and doesn’t say “kitchen’s closed” at any particular hour of the day. The only thing you need to track with alternate-day fasting is your calories: You simply cut them down to 25 percent of your normal intake every other day, then eat how you like on opposite days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not right for everyone, but if you’re wondering whether or not ADF lives up to its reputation for weight loss and other health perks, we’ve gathered the research and asked the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and metabolism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most touted benefits of ADF is its impact on metabolism. According to weight-loss dietitian and nutrition writer Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition, ADF’s influence on metabolism is not unlike that of a keto diet. “Alternate-day fasting can support metabolic health by giving the body time to enter ketosis,” she says. “This is a process where your body starts to use fat as its primary energy source, rather than carbohydrates, and typically starts after at least 18 hours of fasting.” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224025161" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that ketosis may help preserve muscle mass, which in turn can support a more active metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic boost ADF may give is no small feat for body composition. A&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049520302006" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 systematic review and meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who followed this eating pattern for six months had reduced body mass index (BMI), body weight, and total cholesterol. That’s a pretty impressive combo for metabolic health—and one of the more promising alternate-day fasting benefits supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of ADF for metabolism don’t stop there. “It may also be beneficial for those with diabetes or pre-diabetes, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7138754/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:some studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest ADF can reduce fasting insulin levels more than daily calorie restriction, though results are still mixed and may depend on the individual,” Mitri says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215592/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:early studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; have explored ADF’s effect on heart disease risk markers, such as cholesterol and blood pressure, Mitri points out. “However, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are mixed on this, and more recent research suggests ADF does not have any positive impact on heart disease,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every research study has shown dramatic results for metabolism, either. A&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5680777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2017 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that people who tried ADF didn’t experience more weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, or other metabolic measures than those who restricted calories every day, or even those who had no dietary intervention at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nensuria / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No shocker here: Burning fat and preserving muscle could lead to weight loss. Though studies have had varying results, some show that the back-and-forth of alternate-day fasting is more than the sum of its caloric parts. “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.586036/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows people following ADF can lose 3-7% of their body weight in 8-12 weeks, along with reductions in body fat, waist circumference, and visceral fat,” says Amy Davis, M.S., R.D. These are some of the most sought-after alternate-day fasting benefits, especially for those with weight-related health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever struggled with diets that pigeonhole your eating into narrow food categories or time windows, Davis says alternate-day fasting can be a smart choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who might benefit most include people who struggle with moderation, those who don’t like tracking food or macros, people who like large meals and find portion control difficult, and individuals with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nadiia Borovenko / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alternate-day fasting and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t want to live longer? Some research shows that ADF could promote longevity, though Davis cautions that many studies have been conducted on animals, and more research is needed. Three processes that could help explain why alternate-day fasting may support longevity are autophagy, metabolic switching, and enhanced cellular function. “Autophagy is the process of cellular repair that can enhance mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative damage,” Davis explains. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10509423/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that fasting triggers these helpful activities known for extending lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic switching, on the other hand, is the cycling between feasting and fasting that’s the hallmark of ADF. “Fasting periods deplete glycogen and trigger fat oxidation, which boosts metabolic flexibility,” Davis says. Some researchers believe a flexible metabolism may play a role in supporting healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, supporting cellular health and metabolic efficiency is often considered beneficial for longevity. A fasting-based eating plan has been studied for its potential to influence markers associated with aging and metabolic function, though it’s not currently recommended as a treatment for any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s important not to offset the potential benefits of fasting with the food you eat on your “off” days. “While ‘feast day’ may sound like a free-for-all, the quality of the foods consumed on those days matters, especially for longevity,” Davis says. “Certain foods have been linked to longevity, including fiber-rich plant-based options like vegetables, beans, whole grains, and nuts.” On the other hand, a diet high in ultra-processed foods has been associated with negative health outcomes, including markers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538973/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tied to a shorter lifespan.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tied to a shorter lifespan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sasithorn Phuapankasemsuk / iStock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who shouldn’t try alternate-day fasting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any diet, ADF isn’t right for everyone. “Certain individuals should avoid alternate-day fasting,” says Davis. Those with a history of eating disorders should steer clear, she says, since the restrictive nature of fasting can be a trigger. “Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and teens should also avoid ADF, since they need consistent nutrition to support growth and development.” Lastly, those taking insulin or other diabetes meds should avoid fasting to prevent hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re OK flexing your willpower muscles, alternate-day fasting could be your sweet spot for a trimmer figure, higher metabolism, longer life, and more. Just be sure to check in with your healthcare provider before starting a new diet, especially one that involves fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT OUR EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D., is a weight-loss dietitian, nutrition writer, and owner of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melissa Mitri Nutrition.

            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.

            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000p3b6nup876464@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000q3b6nybz2yl8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000v3b6ngwhrbstj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000z3b6nd2j0kcik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200143b6nrrqr11fi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200153b6nhnt9pxw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200163b6n8m32g530@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000j3b6nark07ipt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000m3b6n9eoz33g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000n3b6ntex2w5tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000q3b6nybz2yl8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The issue of salt and saturated fat
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000v3b6ngwhrbstj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000z3b6nd2j0kcik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200143b6nrrqr11fi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200153b6nhnt9pxw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200163b6n8m32g530@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmd9di98s001o3b6ntvap3he8@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="navigating-the-alt-meat-landscape" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001g3b6nfg4b8v6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Out-of-Touch Adult’s Guide to Kid Culture, where you have joined my new religious group, just by reading these words. This week, we're taking a look at an online cult that got a little too real, asking why young people are branding themselves with liquid nitrogen, and discussing the generational stare-down being enacted across the counters of retail establishments all over the country. Plus a &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; viral video about the dangers of jumbotrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-children-of-the-waning-star-an-online-cult"&gt;Is Children of the Waning Star an online cult? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your child says they've joined a cult called "Children of the Waning Star," it's not as bad as it seems.  The online group began on July 11, when TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Gigi Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; announced she was starting a cult, "and you're all going to be a part of it." It was obviously a joke, but the video took off on the platform, earning millions of views, and before long, the cult began picking up steam. Jarvis and her followers chose the name "Children of the Waning Star," picked some special cult symbols, and declared new holidays. Jarvis even added "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis/video/7526461163597499662" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;cult leader&lt;/a&gt;" to her resume. But then the blowback started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commenters informed Jarvis that cults are &lt;em&gt;not something you should joke about.&lt;/em&gt; Others, like this "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;pagan witch,&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@char.char_slide/video/7527026025599864078" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;posted videos&lt;/a&gt; about how the Waning Star was "&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle/video/7526951293856910605" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;spiraling out of control&lt;/a&gt;" or &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@therealliberty_belle/video/7526951293856910605" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;becoming a real cult.&lt;/a&gt; So Jarvis, less than a week after she started her group, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@notgigijarvis/photo/7528239581473393933" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;announced she was shutting&lt;/a&gt; down the project. A week from cult to apology might be the world record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand why stopped, but I think it's a shame. Jarvis clearly wasn't trying to be a cult leader for &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, and Children of the Waning Star isn't the first (or the 10,000th) parody religion ever created. There's the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Church of the Subgenius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.spaghettimonster.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Pastafarians&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism?ref=highexistence.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Discordian Society,&lt;/a&gt; and many more. None of these "spiraled out of control" or become "real" cults, even though they've been around for decades. Instead, they serve a real purpose by giving people a way to think and talk about unusual belief systems, and maybe provide tools to recognize the methods of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; authoritarian groups so they can be avoided.  Also: I really liked that Waning Star chose everything democratically. It would have been interesting to see the TikTok collective define and codify its spiritual beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-freeze-branding"&gt;What is "freeze branding"?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_brand" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Freeze branding,&lt;/a&gt; or cryo branding, is a method of using cryogenic materials, usually liquid nitrogen, to mark livestock. It's thought to be less painful and damaging than branding with heat. It was first practiced in 1960s, and it took all the way until 2021 for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8166665/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;a case of human freeze branding to be recorded in medical literature&lt;/a&gt;. The procedure has been gaining enough traction among body modification fans online lately for doctors to&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7494792376762862890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt; issue stern warnings against the practice&lt;/a&gt;. Although it doesn't seem that widespread. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are not a horse," dermatologist Dr. Andrea Suarez (known online as &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Dray&lt;/a&gt;) reminds us &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7494792376762862890" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;in this TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, "This can result in a full thickness burn that puts you at risk for a deep infection called cellulitis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7494792376762862890"&gt;
    
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dray sure is a &lt;em&gt;downer&lt;/em&gt;, but I assume she's right, and that no one should ever brand themself with liquid nitrogen because it's super, super bad—but I get why people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to. The effect on cattle is cool: Freeze branding (animals) destroys pigmentation in hair follicles, resulting in white hair and/or white skin in the shape of the brand. There isn't much serious discussion online about how/if it's possible to cold brand people safely, but this video from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aD8w9_1VXzs" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;another online doctor&lt;/a&gt; reveals that doctors use liquid nitrogen regularly, so it seems &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to cold brand people without disastrous consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-gen-z-stare"&gt;What is the "Gen-Z Stare?"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "Gen Z stare" is popping up all over &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/genzstare" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/what-is-the-gen-z-stare-all-about-the-latest-term-dividing-the-internet-11772963" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;non&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/gen-z-stare-latest-tiktok-170034069.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;social&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/07/17/gen-z-stare/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. It refers to the blank expression that is supposedly common among people between the ages of 13 and 28 years old, noticed especially often among &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6YXLBjW/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;retail workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gen Z, it is said, responds to boiler-plate greetings and small talk with an inscrutable stare instead of a smile or nod. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not a new term—&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meghan.alessi/video/7397202641966746911" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this video explaining the phenomena is nearly a year old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;— it has gone &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; viral lately. Is this a real shift in cultural behavior, or a trendy age-based online carping campaign? It's hard to say when it comes to something as amorphous as people online reporting, "the barista looks at me funny when I order Starbucks," but it feels more like the "older generation" (Millennial) overblowing a small trait of Gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of past generational moral panics, like &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-endanger-casual-dining-restaurants-2017-5" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Millennials killing casual dining&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and 100 other things), &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/the-waves/2022/10/youve-been-trained-to-distrust-womens-voices" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vocal fry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkem" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jenkem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gol-53Be2k0" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rainbow parties&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/woke-m-ms-and-8-other-ridiculous-moral-panics-through-1850028075" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;switchblades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the "overly jaunty" rhythm of Bing Crosby's "&lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/639027/bbc-banned-bing-crosby-song" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deep in the Heart of Texas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;." (To be fair, that shit is fucking &lt;em&gt;jaunty&lt;/em&gt;.) Also: If low-wage workers stare blankly at older people, it might be because they deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s rare for the entire internet to collectively agree on something, but this week, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, from Baby Boomers to Gen A, shared the same reaction to a viral video: "I'm glad I'm not &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; people." No one needs it explained, I guess, but you don't get more viral than this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video in question was shot at a recent Coldplay concert in Massachusetts. It begins innocently enough: The camera pans to a couple embracing tenderly, and the crowd cheers. But things go south quickly when the pair realize they’re on the Jumbotron and freak out. Their awkward attempts to duck and hide only draw attention to the drama. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin even narrates the moment: “Oh, look at these two,” he says from the stage, before pausing and adding, "Either they’re having an affair, or they’re just very shy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first one, Chris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet quickly identified the couple as Andy Byron, the CEO of tech company called Astronomer who is extremely married to someone who isn't Astronomer's "chief people officer" Kristin Cabot.In the following days, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/17/business/ex-employee-of-tech-ceo-andy-byron-claims-he-was-a-toxic-boss-before-coldplay-drama/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;former employees came out to shit talk their old boss&lt;/a&gt;, Astronomer's board launched an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/astronomer-andy-byron-coldplay-kiss-cam.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, more than &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/coldplay-kiss-cam-astronomer" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;15 million people read about the event online&lt;/a&gt; (that's as much exposure as the Diddy trial had), and Byron's wife &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/18/entertainment/astronomer-ceo-andy-byrons-wife-had-happy-family-photos-on-facebook-until-his-affair-was-exposed/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;took the family photos off Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As amusing as all this is, I can't help but feel sympathy for those involved. Imagine that everyone you know—your friends, your family, your co-workers, your second grade teacher—has video proof that you attended a Coldplay concert.&lt;/p&gt;

However, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24280-triclosan" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, triclosan can still be found in some toothpastes, deodorants, cosmetics and detergents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QNB4GKQUNVFZLMEMDLV4PXM4M4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recent study followed 347 mothers and their children from pregnancy through the children’s 12th birthdays. During that period, urinary triclosan concentrations in mother-child pairs were assessed through age 5, and then again at 8 and 12 years old. From ages 6 months to 12 years, caregivers (via survey) were asked about any allergy symptoms, including eczema, allergic rhinitis and wheezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3IMMZFABFBGDLEQUDJ5ZRK3IFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children with double the urinary triclosan levels were 12 percent more likely to show hay fever symptoms, such as sneezing or congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="54QZWY2VLFD4NIJJ6PJQ5Q5Z4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, the child’s sex appeared to influence the risk. Among boys, each twofold increase in the level of triclosan found in the mother’s urine during pregnancy was associated with almost double (1.9 times) the child’s risk of reporting allergic rhinitis symptoms, including sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes, the researchers reported. For that same increase in urinary triclosan, the risk of a female child reporting allergic rhinitis symptoms was 9 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGO6J6TOSZAD5IBMUERNLETXSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The reason behind the triclosan-eczema association remained unclear. “One hypothesis we have is that triclosan kills off helpful bacteria that live on our skin and in our bodies that help us form healthy immune responses,” said Hannah Laue, the first author of the study and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FQMWQR2EDJDJ5DCRUCSEDZI4PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article is part of The Post’s “Big Number” series, which takes a brief look at the statistical aspect of health issues.

    &lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar. But new research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body’s most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain’s security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients. The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body’s natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells’ ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol’s effect on the blood vessels’ ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required. They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body’s natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a “clot buster” called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke. But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced “blood vessel on a chip” systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts. This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives. While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar’s sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It’s now found in thousands of products, especially in many “sugar-free” and “keto-friendly” foods.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such a protein bars.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-many-protein-bars-on-shelf-2472314243"&gt;Stockah/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade-off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory agencies, including the European Food Standards Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration, have approved erythritol as safe for consumption. But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even “natural” sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and diabetes prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes. But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain’s protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet. While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;In South Korea, there's a long hallway lined with walk-in refrigerators. Inside are boxes filled with oral cholera vaccines. This is the emergency cholera vaccine stockpile — and boxes are flying off the shelves to places like Angola, Sudan and South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, we're shipping about 5 million doses every month, so this means that as soon as the box comes in, another one is going out," says Allyson Russell, an epidemiologist at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and a senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security. Gavi, a global public-private organization, funds the stockpile and aims to have a little more than 5 million doses available at any given time, although it has had &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/07/1236721063/the-world-is-facing-a-major-cholera-vaccine-shortage-amid-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trouble in the past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meeting this target.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are similar stockpiles around the world. In freezers in Switzerland, there are Ebola vaccines. Elsewhere there are meningitis vaccines stored up; same with yellow fever vaccines. While some are kept at ultra-cold temperatures, like the Ebola vaccines, most only need to be refrigerated. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine sticking your hand in a refrigerator to get out your groceries," says Russell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first global stockpile was established in 1997 when major meningitis outbreaks in Africa prompted public health crisis. The vaccines are available to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;any country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world. These stockpiles are now in the spotlight because, for the first time, researchers have quantified just how many lives have been saved by drawing on the stored vaccines. But this news comes against the backdrop of uncertainty. There are new concerns about what the future of these global stockpiles will look like amid a major drop in global health funding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly how much of a 'game changer'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Russell spends her days immersed in the details of the stockpile system. She knows which countries have emailed in the form to request doses from the stockpile. She knows whether the doses are being raced to an outbreak via chartered flight or in the cargo of a commercial airplane.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And one thing is clear to her. "You can see how vaccines change the trajectory of what happens [in an outbreak]," she says. "Vaccine can really be a game changer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, she says, she's never known exactly how much of a "game changer" these stockpiles are — until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have crunched the numbers. They looked at more than 200 outbreaks over the past 20-some years, modeling what would happen without the vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au/about-us/our-people-and-structure/our-people/nick-scott/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nick Scott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the&lt;em&gt; British Medical Journal — Global Health&lt;/em&gt;, says the results were exciting: A 60% reduction in cases and deaths from outbreaks because of the stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's quite an amazing thing," said Scott, who is head of modeling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, an independent medical research group. That 60% drop means about 6 million cases were averted and 300,000 deaths were averted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really was meant to ask the question of, are GAVI stockpiles worthwhile? Is it worthwhile to have them?" says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/360/ruth-karron" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ruth Karron&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative and was not involved in the study. "And I think that the answer — very robustly — is absolutely."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research — which was funded by Gavi and started in early 2024 with the goal of helping inform its strategic planning — found over $32 billion dollars in economic benefits from the stockpiles, given there were fewer deaths and less disability in the 200-some outbreaks researchers considered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers say this is a significant underestimate and the true economic benefits are likely much higher. That's because this calculation does not take into account things like the cost of outbreak response that are avoided or the economic disruptions created by large outbreaks. Based on Gavi's &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/investing/funding/resource-mobilisation/Gavi-Investment-Opportunity-2026-2030.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;financial planning documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, procurement for the stockpiles costs less than $100 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott's team also found that speed really matters. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When there is an outbreak, the faster the vaccine response can start, the more impactful it will be," he says. This matters because containing a disease's spread can mean avoiding huge social disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we found is that these vaccines are really critical for preventing things like school closures, business closures, travel restrictions," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of speed is one of the reasons the stockpiles exist in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It can easily take up to a year to make these vaccines. Ebola vaccines take a year. Meningitis vaccines take about four to six months," Russell says. "If you were to place the order and then make the vaccines, who knows what would happen to the outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, Scott says, having the vaccines ready is not enough. There also need to be mechanisms in place to get the doses to the outbreak and then administer them to people who live and work in the affected area. As international aid organizations face historic funding cuts these steps could get harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Everything is up for question'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karron says the findings come at a particularly important time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01240-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the medical journal The Lancet. And it's forcing international health organizations to grapple with what they can afford to keep and what they have to let go. These days everything is on the table, including the global stockpiles of emergency vaccines, says Karron.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gavi is almost $3 billion short of its budget goal for the next five years. Part of the shortfall comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/06/25/g-s1-74554/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. announcing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that it will cut off support for Gavi until it is able to "re-earn the public trust." Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained the decision by saying Gavi had neglected issues of vaccine safety, an accusation Gavi vigorously denies. Critics says &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; RFK Jr. cited as evidence is flawed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This week, the organization's board is meeting to figure out what to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So obviously, everything is up for question," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One challenge with the stockpiles is that stored doses can expire, explains Karron. Doses made for routine immunizations are, generally, used quickly and don't bump up against their expiration dates. That's not a guarantee with the stockpile. Gavi does have a system where once vaccines in the stockpile reach one year left in their shelf life, they can be used in a preventive program — for example in a high-risk location where researchers anticipate meningitis outbreaks. However, Karron says, that is not always possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So, the question is: Is it worth the investment knowing that you might have some vaccine that goes to waste?" she asks. She says the clear answer from this study is that it's in everyone's interest to keep the emergency vaccine stockpiles fully stocked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't want some of these diseases, like Ebola, to come to our [U.S.] shores, we really need to contain them at the source," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The rate at which our bodies age and wear down doesn't necessarily match our actual age, and the differences can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;help predict lifespan&lt;/a&gt; and disease risk. Now, researchers have developed a new tool for assessing biological age from a single brain scan taken halfway through our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool, put together by an international team of scientists, is based on a dataset of 1,037 people born in Dunedin in New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. The health of these individuals has been carefully tracked over time, giving scientists a useful long-term database of stats that reflect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;the body's actual age&lt;/a&gt; – not how many birthdays have passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the researchers used those stats to assess biological aging, and train a tool they've called DunedinPACNI – Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging. That sums up its function, which is to match aging to markers in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-breakthrough-brain-scans-predict-disease-up-to-9-years-early?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Breakthrough: Brain Scans Predict Disease Up to 9 Years Early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system has the potential to quickly assess the body's age to a good degree of accuracy, and from there health and disease risks, including the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;chances of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than needing multiple tests over time, just a single brain scan is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ahmad Hariri from Duke University in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DunedinPACNI takes in 99 key brain measurements to make its assessment, including the thickness of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt; – which affects language and thinking – and the volume of gray matter in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers had developed DunedinPACNI, they tested it on a variety of data from other health research projects, covering more than 50,000 people in total. It was shown to work well at estimating biological age, and at predicting future health problems such as cognitive impairment &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;and heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a tool that offers perfect accuracy each time, but it scores as well as or better than current biological age assessment methods, the researchers say. What's more, it was shown to be useful across different demographic and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/providing-cash-to-low-income-mothers-puts-their-baby-s-brains-on-a-new-wavelength"&gt;socioeconomic groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The link between aging of the brain and body is pretty compelling," &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hariri. "It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168307" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-3.jpg" alt="Brain scan differences" class="wp-image-168307 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-3.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-3-600x315.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168307" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how brain structure matched biological age.

Changes in diet or exercise at that point could make a major difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are particularly interested in predicting the risk of the various types of dementia, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Eating a raw banana peel may not be appealing, but you can incorporate them into your meals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s roughly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-much-fiber-per-day-11682977" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;3 to 7 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; per 100 grams of peel, according to &lt;a href="https://cse.tcu.edu/faculty-staff/view/anne-vanbeber" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Anne VanBeber, PhD, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Christian University.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A single banana peel contains about 1,025 milligrams of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/health-benefits-of-potassium-4588613" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; VanBeber added that specific carotenoids, like lutein, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene, also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-for-eye-health-8726946" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support eye and skin health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fiber in banana peels can bind to cholesterol in the digestive tract, helping excrete it from the body, said Zenker. “The polyphenols in banana peels may also play a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-5189944" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting healthy cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, like catechin, campesterol, and stigmasterol,” she added.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels in the long term can support overall heart health, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Banana peels’ rich fiber and polyphenol content may also help slow down how fast your body absorbs carbohydrates, which supports better &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-eat-when-blood-sugar-is-high-5120368" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt;, said Zenker.

These are tales of recovery, but also of the need for vigilance. For people experiencing mental illness, treatment is not about a cure, but effective management of life as it is. Whether through medicine, therapy or other support, people experiencing an intolerable crisis can find a way back. They must only take a step toward those who want to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;One inspiring story stands out. Years ago, just a few miles through the Itasca County woods where we both live, I met a great musician and a kindred spirit in the study of Iron Range history. At first, I knew nothing about his private battle with mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;As a kid in the 1990s and early 2000s, Sam Miltich became a self-taught jazz guitar phenomenon.

It’s about learning to trust the process, be gentle with yourself, and keep going even when it’s tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For the days when you feel like you should be further along. Save this for when the in-between feels heavy—and if you’re up for it, how’s your journey really feeling lately?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her post really resonated with other users, who left hundreds of comments about how they feel they are in a strange grey area of their jab journey, even if they have lost enormous amounts of weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TikTokker @Swedish_Sandra was inundated with messages from other users 'in the middle' of their journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra is one of the thousands of people currently in the 'middle' of their weight loss journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'The middle is so hard, I have lost ten stone, which is a massive achievement but because I started out at 26 stone, it doesn’t look like the massive transformation I see on other people.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another added: 'The middle is hard. I’ve dropped 54 lbs but I still feel and see a fat girl in the mirror. Certain body parts bother me so much more now than they did before.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were scores of similar messages from other people who had found themselves not feeling familiar with their new, evolving, bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'80lbs with 40 to go, it’s great but it’s so odd to see my stomach now that loose skin is starting to take effect. I don’t feel like my body matches me and everything I do at all ,' said one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others admitted that they were finding this period 'soul crushing' and 'boring' as their final goal 'seems so very far away'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Middle is where I think we really do the work,. It’s triggering, falling into negative feelings and not giving up is the hard bit.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra, who has not revealed how much weight she has lost since starting on Mounjaro around five months ago, responded in the comments, and encouraged her fellow jabbers to keep pushing on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote:  'I completely get that, that initial excitement has died down but you’re not at goal weight yet. Sometimes it feels dull and slow. But those boring moments are the real, steady progress that doesn’t always get the spotlight, even though it’s what really lasts.'&lt;/p&gt;

The video is clearly shot in private, and although it shows her face it doesn’t have her name on it. This girl behaved really badly and completely shattered my friend’s heart, and while I don’t want to believe he would put something like this online, he is so hurt that it’s not outside the realm of possibility. She would lose her job and her career if this video was found, and she comes from a very conservative family. My questions: What are my obligations here? Do I ask my friend about it? Contact the ex? Part of me wishes I could forget that I saw it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="210" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32rm001i3b6h887rl3et@published"&gt;In my day people took sexy Polaroids of each other then hid them in the sock drawer. After a bad breakup, they took the pictures out of the gym sock and burned them. It’s too bad that one can no longer memorialize one’s hotness with such nonchalance. As my colleague Emily Bazelon&lt;a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html"&gt; recently described&lt;/a&gt;, this new plague of revenge porn is ruining lives and there is currently little legal recourse. (California just passed a law making&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/01/california-brown-anti-revenge-porn-bill/2906305/"&gt; posting such material a misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt;.) I talked to expert&lt;a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=028"&gt; Danielle Citron&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and author of the forthcoming book, Hate 3.0, about what can be done for this woman. First of all, contact your friend. If indeed he is the perpetrator, you should tell him that you have now seen the video. Tell him you know his ex did him wrong, but he should not compound the wrongdoing by exacting such vicious revenge. Citron says if he posted to a site where he controls his content, he could simply take down the video. Let’s hope it hasn’t been more widely disseminated and that her name hasn’t gotten attached. But if he gave it to a revenge porn website, then unfortunately he’s really lost control of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sa001r3b6hjwawcllb@published"&gt;You should also contact the ex-girlfriend. She’s entitled to know the bad news, which has the potential for painful professional and personal consequences. Citron says that if the video was a selfie, the woman would own the copyright. In that case it would be worth it for her to hire a lawyer to write a letter to the site operator where it’s being posted without her permission. But its being taken down is far from assured. If the woman is sure that the images were posted by her ex, Citron laid out other legal avenues she could explore, such as filing a civil claim of infliction of emotional distress or seeking criminal harassment action be taken against him. But Citron notes pursuing a civil lawsuit would be expensive and that law enforcement has taken a lax attitude toward these cases. Sadly, because of technology, people need to be aware when giving sexual photographs or videos of themselves to a paramour that love may die, but the images could live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

As I married a year ago, we field endless questions about when we’re going to have kids. My brother just had a baby. His sibling just had a baby. Going on Facebook is an endless parade of their kids from all of our relatives. Discussions are focused solely around their kids, then are turned to us. I keep saying, “We’re happily child-free,” but I’m losing my resolve. I’m constantly surrounded by something I’ll never get to have, but I don’t know how to broach the conversation with our families. I’m afraid the fertility-happy will try and tell us we just haven’t been trying long enough or that God will give us a baby when he sees fit. Based on our finances and the frequency of things falling through, adoption is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32s4001o3b6hr1ixa8vu@published"&gt;The only time I went through the X-ray machine at the airport, I miscarried the only pregnancy I’ve ever had. Since then, I’ve “opted out” (so has my husband, in solidarity) as we’ve been continually trying to get pregnant in the years since. Last time I flew, the TSA agent roughly groped my vagina and labia, and I had a panic attack. I’ve avoided flying since.&lt;/p&gt;

What can I do to protect my body, any potential pregnancy (we’re in the two-week wait), and my sanity?&lt;/p&gt;

The timing of your last miscarriage is terrible, and your reluctance at the thought of getting X-rayed again is understandable, but the energy of the X-ray beam of an airport scanner is very low and does not penetrate the skin. According to the &lt;a href="http://hps.org/"&gt;Health Physics Society&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to radiation safety,&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sr00213b6hqo00f0tn@published"&gt;There is an American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard stating that people-scanning devices should expose an individual to no more than 0.25 microsievert per screening (one screening procedure generally consists of two scans). The two primary companies that sell people screeners say that their devices expose people to half that amount of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sb001s3b6hwy0bfir2@published"&gt;For perspective, 0.25 microsievert is also received by flying about a minute and a half (cosmic radiation during commercial flight exposes fliers to about 10 microsievert per hour). It is also received by living for 40 minutes (natural background radiation exposes people to about 0.35 microsievert per hour)…The American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard took into account the varying sensitivity of different groups of people who might be scanned. The authors first looked at a number of reports and published studies on the health effects of radiation. They then chose the 0.25 microsievert dose level to ensure that children and pregnant individuals can be safely scanned with these devices. The x-ray scanner uses a very low-energy and low-intensity radiation, so that an embryo/fetus is not exposed to any radiation that could possibly increase the developmental risks of radiation to the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;

Learn more about anxiety treatments—anything from deep-breathing exercises to &lt;em&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/em&gt; —that you can perform on yourself when you’re feeling cornered in the security line. You can also apply for TSA Pre-Check, which may only require you to go through an old-school metal detector. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vd00123b6h7452l9gf@published"&gt;My husband and I had our third child last fall. And for the third time, my mom pressured me to name her after my late sister, “Paloma.” Like before, I told her no, and we went with our originally planned name. But now my mom is on a push about how I haven’t honored Paloma or shared memories with my kids about her, and that they’re being harmed by missing out on her as an aunt. My 6-year-old and 4-year-old know that I had a sister, but that she’s dead (classic blunt child response). But I haven’t really talked much about her. Now that my parents live closer and see the kids more often, my mom wants to change that. I don’t really want to.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001f3b6hj6tdr3aw@published"&gt;Paloma was six years older than me. She died of complications from anorexia in her early 20s. Because of the age difference and her substantial impatient time, we weren’t that close. I honestly felt more relief than anything when she died, because her eating disorder tortured my parents almost as much as it tortured her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vt00183b6heg97eqrk@published"&gt;I know EDs and mental illness in general can be hell, but I genuinely have no good memories of her after she was about 15. She was deeply in the grip of the disorder, and it made her mean, self-destructive, judgmental, and secretive. I have distinct memories of her telling me from her hospital bed that I was fat and unlovable when I was going through puberty. And that’s probably the warmest interaction we had in my teens.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vz00193b6hls9xpux2@published"&gt;I recognize the memories I have aren’t the full version of who she was before she got sick. I loved her, but I didn’t like her. I don’t know what I could possibly pass on to my kids to share about her, besides one or two memories from when I was 7 or 8 years old. I recognize that my mom is grieving, and probably always will be. But I don’t really want to get into the details of Paloma until my kids are teenagers. Is that unfair?&lt;/p&gt;

If not, it might be time to have a heartfelt but brutally honest conversation. Bring some of the specific examples that you shared here. Explain how you don’t really have any positive memories of your sister to pass on—and thus she isn’t a person that you feel you can truly honor in your family.&lt;/p&gt;

Your decision to be neutral about her is a way to be respectful—to both your sister and your mom.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wy001p3b6h8ii568cj@published"&gt;One olive branch you could consider is inviting your mom to tell the kids about Paloma. Of course, there may need to be some guardrails around these conversations. But I suspect your mom fears that Paloma is being erased or forgotten by the family.  That’s a devastating prospect for any parent. Telling her, “I can’t be the one to share Paloma with the kids, but you’re welcome to,” might give you the reprieve you need.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wd001c3b6hcdaqzckb@published"&gt;Still, even with your best intentions, your mom might not be able to hear any of this.  If that’s the case, you might consider whether family therapy could help you have this conversation more effectively. The Paloma you knew is, for all intents and purposes, not the same Paloma your mom knew and loved. She might need a neutral third party to help her come to terms with that painful truth. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

We have an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. The issue we’re facing is that my in-laws have a pool with no fence around it. Because of this, I have refused to let the kids visit their place without my husband and/or me present. My mother-in-law claims that because our kids know how to swim, a fence isn’t necessary—and that installing one would “spoil” her view of the yard. She’s been rather abrasive with me because I refuse to compromise. What can I do to impress upon her that tragedies can still happen, even to kids who know how to swim?&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, you’re the one who is responsible for your kids’ well-being, so &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; get to decide what you’re comfortable with. There are so many tragedies with backyard pools that robust conversations around pool safety are a must. In the U.S., it’s the third cause of unintentional injury-related death for kids 5 to 19, which you might share with her, along with some of the harrowing stories shared by parents in this &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/06/child-drowning-pool-swimming-safety.html"&gt;Slate article about preventing such tragedies&lt;/a&gt;. If the science might sway her, you can point her to &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001047/full"&gt;studies that show that pool fencing&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces the risk of drowning. Or that organizations like the &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/shop-the-best-pool-safety-products-for-summer/"&gt;National Drowning Prevention Alliance strongly recommend them&lt;/a&gt; (plus they have suggestions on which to buy).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001e3b6h5q6h13ix@published"&gt;I confess that I am &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a pool owner, but I wonder if some compromise can be found. Would she be more amenable if she knew about the existence of removable fences—one that she can put up and take down at her leisure? Maybe not, since it’ll require additional work on her part. But she could presumably take the fence down if she plans to have company over, for example, or is having a weekend at home without the kids around. There are also &lt;a href="https://usglassfence.com/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-glass-pool-fencing/"&gt;glass pool fences&lt;/a&gt; that could help keep her “view” intact while still providing safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4x4001u3b6hjqh0241b@published"&gt;I wonder whether a broader conversation about all points of pool safety might uncover more common ground with your MIL than you expected. Take the opportunity to talk through other pool precautions the family should be taking beyond fencing. The experts quoted in that earlier Slate article, for example, point out that the most crucial piece of pool safety is close supervision when someone is in the water. They stressed that the person supervising “needs to be constantly attentive, close by (within arm’s reach for a novice swimmer, she says), capable of identifying drowning, and prepared to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4xa001v3b6hokjvgdvn@published"&gt;For the future, it might be worth considering where you’ll stand on the issue when your kids are a bit older. How long would the fence need to stay up for you to be comfortable? Is there an age where you don’t feel like a fence is needed? Perhaps the answer is no, and that’s OK, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wq001l3b6h0cw2xfnw@published"&gt;Realistically, she probably won’t budge, and neither should you. You say you recently just moved, so give it some time. Be kind in your insistence, and as patient as you can be when she expresses her refusal to change her yard, as is her right. Hopefully, she will (begrudgingly) get used to your rules. Demand safety, but don’t let the fence come between you if it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006t3b6htduj96mp@published"&gt;Let me clarify a few things. You say your parents want to be outside the delivery room so they can see the baby immediately. Have you done a hospital tour yet? I delivered in two different facilities, and in both cases, anyone not directly assisting with the birth was kept down the hall, through a secure door, in a designated waiting area—essentially “on hold” until the baby and afterbirth were delivered and mom was cleaned up. So before you make this decision, be sure you know your hospital’s procedures and set your parents’ expectations accordingly. (While you’re at it, you might also inquire whether the hospital has separate waiting rooms, where both parents could wait but stay apart.)&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006u3b6hpr0ticrv@published"&gt;It’s also important to keep in mind that you have no idea how your birth is going to go. Most of the women I know experienced both intense joy and intense vulnerability in those post-first-birth hours. Some wanted to see people right away—eager to enjoy their baby with their loved ones. Others felt overwhelmed or in so much discomfort that they only wanted their spouse and child nearby. And for some, what they wanted after the baby was born was the opposite of what they’d planned beforehand. So be upfront with yourself and your loved ones that any plan you make is subject to change at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006v3b6hdslpi4yd@published"&gt;Which brings me to one of my two most important points in this reply: Your letter told me what your parents want, and what your husband wants. What do you want? Because, as the owner of the VIU (Very Important Uterus), the way this day goes is ultimately your call. It’s arguably the only time in your life when you can make demands that others must simply fulfill.  If you want your parents to meet the baby together, then brush up on your mediation skills and set some non-negotiable ground rules. If you’d rather tell everyone to take a chill pill and wait, that’s your prerogative, too. You get to decide what this looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006w3b6h8msvuppw@published"&gt;Since this is an advice column, though, I’ll give you my personal opinion. If it were me, I’d let the grandparents meet the baby first—before any other siblings or family who might also be in the waiting room—but only once I felt settled and ready. And I would have them meet the baby separately rather than together. This is a huge milestone, not only for you and your husband, but also for your parents (especially if this is their first grandchild). I wouldn’t want anyone to ruin that for you or themselves, and I would be nervous that putting them in a room together is setting them up to fail. I don’t want that for any of you. And I’d flip a coin (in advance and in full view) to decide who goes first.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006x3b6herj9fget@published"&gt;I will close with the second of my two most important points: This birth is just the beginning. Once the baby is born, your parents are going to want to be present for many more events, from birthday parties and religious rites to band concerts. If I were in your shoes, I’d start demanding that they grow up and learn how to be in the same room with each other. Your child deserves no less, and your life will be much easier if you don’t have to keep asking versions of this same question over the next 18-plus years. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s the only way I knew how to put it. So many things could set her off: new carpeting, air fresheners, plastic off-gassing, diesel. Perfumes were among the worst offenders. On top of that, she developed terrible food allergies. The sound of her sniffling became the chorus of my childhood. Some days she couldn’t get out of bed. I’d peek into her darkened room and see her face pinched in discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Her joints ached, her head swam. Doctors suggested that maybe she was depressed or anxious. “Well, you’d be anxious too if you couldn’t lick an envelope, couldn’t pick up your daughter in a car,” she’d reply. She tried allergists, got nowhere. Finally, she found her way to holistic health, whose practitioners told her she had something called multiple chemical sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As long as people have complained that man-made stuff in their environment causes health problems—migraines and asthma, exhaustion and mood swings—the medical establishment has largely dismissed them. The American Medical Association, World Health Organization, and the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy &amp;amp; Immunology don’t recognize chemical sensitivity as a diagnosis. If they talk about it at all, they tend to dismiss it as psychosomatic, a malady of the neurotic and health-obsessed. Why, these authorities wondered, would people react to minute traces of a huge array of chemicals? And why couldn’t they ever seem to get better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This isn’t some trivial affliction. Roughly a quarter of American adults report some form of chemical sensitivity; it lives alongside chronic pain and fibromyalgia as both evidently real and resistant to mainstream diagnosis or treatment. My mom tried a thousand things—elimination diets, antihistamines, lymphatic massage, antidepressants, acupuncture, red light therapy, saunas, heavy-metal detoxes. Sometimes her symptoms eased, but she never got better. Her illness ruled our lives, dictating what products we bought, what food we ate, where we traveled. I felt there had to be an answer for why this was happening. It didn’t take me long to learn that, if there was one, it’d come from a figure as unassuming as she is provocative: the scientist Claudia Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;On a warm&lt;/span&gt; Texas afternoon, Miller and her affable husband, Bob, lead me through the San Antonio Botanical Garden. A monarch flits by. “I’ve noticed so many fewer butterflies, so many fewer birds, even the last couple of years,” Miller observes. Her raspy voice comes out so quietly that, at times, my recording device fails to pick it up. People are perpetually leaning in close or asking her to repeat herself. At 78, Miller typically uses a cane, but Bob gets the walker out of the car so she can cover more distance. She wears her silver hair in a low side ponytail, fixed in place with a scrunchie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;With her wide, thin-rimmed glasses, Miller disappears into the scenery, but she’s a particularly visible presence in her field. Now a professor emeritus at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Miller has held several federal appointments, chaired National Institutes of Health meetings, testified before Congress, consulted for the Environmental Protection Agency, authored dozens of papers, and worked with the Canadian, German, Japanese, and Swedish governments. In all this, she has tried to make sense of and raise awareness for chemical intolerance. One patient advocate I interviewed called her “Saint Claudia” for her commitment to overlooked and misunderstood patients. Kristina Baehr, an attorney who defends victims of toxic exposures, told me, “To have experts like Dr. Miller tell them you’re not crazy, this is very real, is very life-giving to people. She’s able to validate their experience with facts, with science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One such fact, Miller explains, is this: Over the past century, the United States has undergone a chemical revolution. “Fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas, their combustion products, and then their synthetic chemical derivatives are mostly new since World War II,” she says. “Plasticizers, forever chemicals, you name it: These are all foreign chemicals.” They’re everywhere you look, in homes and offices, parks and schools. They’re also, Miller believes, making people very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 1997, Miller proposed a career-defining theory of how people succumb to this condition. It came with a technical-sounding name, toxicant-induced loss of tolerance, and a convenient acronym, TILT. You can lose tolerance after one severe exposure, Miller says, or after a series of smaller exposures over time. In either case, a switch is flipped: Suddenly, people are triggered by even tiny amounts of everyday substances—cigarette smoke, antibiotics, gas from their stoves—that never bothered them before. These people become, in a word, TILT-ed. It’s not unlike developing an allergy, when the body labels a substance as dangerous and then reacts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQTE1VOFoxS3dibkJZUEZIQ1c1ODRuSXEzb1pGbEhOZE1PVUtHQUZxMHhTR1JiYjFMTUYxY1RYejVRMTh4UldMVnhLbUlCVnVaUlY3QmlKcDlFVFp2YjJmRmRycjNqcnFRWk1haVhPOVNBd3JfeV9qaTA4VnFTeHhwVVh1UGM</guid></item><item><title>布莱恩·约翰逊（ Bryan Johnson ）将死-有线 | Bryan Johnson Is Going to Die - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1wVno0X1g0QkxqWkpjMlpOYzRFa2VWUU5fWnZLbl91Z0FNcDBsbDlqY2lWY2Vac1hZaWVNSEZJUEJya0dBcjBjRnA4VVNKcDV4bnAwYUtlQl9WS25pUWVZaWlHV0JGZzg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;At first, the&lt;/span&gt; two bowls of fruit on Bryan Johnson’s kitchen island look perfect. They’re brimming with plump kiwis, hardy avocados, and ripened bananas. These are the food of the gods, I figure, for a man who aspires to live like one. But then I look closer. A lone orange, its skin flecked with mold, sits adjacent to two lemons, both almost entirely consumed by a layer of white fuzz. Something, it seems, is rotten in the estate of Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That estate, it’s worth noting, is a predictable one. Johnson’s home in Venice, California, is the angular, concrete-floored template of a dwelling you’d assume is owned by a man. Specifically a man who worked in tech, made his millions, and subsequently embarked on a midlife, post-wealth search for purpose. All of which Johnson is, and did, and still appears to be doing: After selling his web payments company, Braintree, for $800 million in 2013, Johnson parted ways with both his wife and his lifelong Mormon religion. In 2021 he announced Project Blueprint, an effort designed to reverse his own body’s aging process. This involves an all-consuming, unproven regimen including but not limited to daily exercises, blood tests, a doctrinal sleep routine, MRIs, plasma transfers, scalp stimulants, urine tests, several dozen supplements, Dexa scans, light therapy, and caloric restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If the rotting fruit didn’t give it away, then no, this is not a kitchen where household memories are made over milk and cookies—although a collage of candid photos taped above Johnson’s stove offers hints of familial warmth. (Johnson has three kids, one of whom is infamous for donating data on his youthful erections and his own plasma to his father’s anti-aging efforts.) This is a kitchen, after all, that shares a home with specimen cups of semen and coolers of Johnson’s blood; where pills and powders, which I find meticulously stocked in Johnson’s walk-in pantry, are mixed, optimized, and consumed; where food is not eaten so much as nutrition is performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Performance, of course, is Johnson’s specialty. There’s the performance of his body, which Johnson claims is now the single healthiest on Earth. And there’s how that body shows up to the viewing public, which it does quite often. Johnson has been the subject of dozens of profiles and interviews, as well as a Netflix documentary released earlier this year. He has amassed more than 4 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and X, and he posts an ongoing stream of content about his sleep habits (sublime), his diet (meticulous), and his erections (trigger warning). Johnson has also used his online reach to push back against recent controversies, including a legal battle with his former fiancée Taryn Southern, and a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/technology/bryan-johnson-blueprint-confidentiality-agreements.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times investigation&lt;/a&gt; into his extensive use of confidentiality agreements to prevent, among other things, Blueprint employees from publicly talking about Johnson as well as his business dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Over a 90-minute conversation, Johnson spoke at length about his longevity protocol, his assessment of RFK Jr.’s MAHA movement, and those agreements that he continues to enforce. He also took great pains to convince me—and all of you—that this wasn’t just about health and longevity. No, like most tech men living in boxy modernist homes and saddled with illusions of grandeur, Johnson has a new holy grail with which to galvanize his faithful following: artificial intelligence, baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GroupCalloutWrapper-bPWknp dhHsN callout callout--group callout--group-2" data-testid="GroupCalloutWrapper"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE imJESW caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd iJViBS yzpFe caption__credit"&gt;PHOTOGRAPH: ERICA HERNANDEZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE imJESW caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd iJViBS yzpFe caption__credit"&gt;PHOTOGRAPH: ERICA HERNANDEZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE DRUMMOND: I’m going to ask you a very simple true-or-false question that you can answer however you want.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the number of Texas measles cases tied to a West Texas outbreak slows to a trickle, South Plains public health director Zach Holbrooks remembers the call from a colleague in an adjacent county six months ago that would change both his — and the state’s — entire 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Katherine was the first person to let me know there was a case,” said Holbrooks, referring to Lubbock’s public health director, Katherine Wells. A Mennonite child from Seminole’s Gaines County — one of four counties under Holbrooks’ charge — had been hospitalized in Lubbock with measles. “So that’s what got the communication rolling between me and Katherine and the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From that first case reported on Jan. 29, the outbreak in West Texas would make up the largest single cluster of measles cases since the virus was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, killing two and spreading to multiple states. As of this week, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;762 people have been infected&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the previous U.S. record from 2019, when an outbreak among the Orthodox Jewish community in New York City resulted in 649 cases. Nationwide, the United States is suffering its worst measles outbreak in nearly three decades with the West Texas outbreak making up more than half of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,309 cases nationwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While it’s been more than a month since a new case has been reported in Gaines County, cases traced back to West Texas continue to be reported across the state in East Texas’ Lamar and Fannin counties, where this week saw the addition of nine new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Technically, Gaines and Lubbock counties are no longer considered active outbreak counties. The spread here seems to have run its course. “They either got the vaccine, the booster or the real thing,” said Dr. Wendell Parkey, chief of staff of Seminole Memorial Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But as the region catches its breath and wait for the entire outbreak to end, health professionals like Holbrooks, Wells and Parkey, as well as the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), have all been considering what worked and what could be improved after working the first real infectious disease test, post COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their answers included better reporting of cases at the patient level, more help with streamlining the testing process at the start and surprisingly, a more balanced treatment approach that was not solely fixated on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As of Friday, DSHS has spent more than $10.6 million in outreach, testing and resource support to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;h3 id="47064a77-1074-4298-a283-63d19731e038" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;How the West Texas outbreak posed significant challenges &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After that first fateful phone call in late January between Wells and Holbrooks, the two looked not to the 2019 New York City outbreak as a guide in how to respond, but to an outbreak that occurred five years earlier, in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;They both pored over a&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602295"&gt; New England Journal of Medicine article&lt;/a&gt; that detailed how that 2014 outbreak impacted a largely unvaccinated Amish population but was mostly contained from spreading. In that case, two unvaccinated men who had traveled to the Philippines to perform relief work had returned to their community with measles. Eventually the outbreak would spread to 383 residents over nine counties before being declared over four months later. Like the West Texas outbreak, about 90% of those infected in Ohio were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I kind of wanted to just wrap my mind around how long, what kind of response are we going to be looking at?” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Surprisingly, the bulk of the spread in Texas occurred in a four month period, also.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That timespan and the fact that Ohio’s involved a branch of Anabaptists, a 16th century Christian movement that believes strongly in separation of church and state, was helpful to Holbrooks. He grew up in Seminole, home to a large population of Mennonites, also a part of the Anabaptist denomination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Both Amish and Mennonite communities have no formal opposition to vaccination but many of their followers are unvaccinated, prompting Holbrooks to immediately seek out community leaders to help spread the word about the outbreak and that vaccination was the best weapon to keep measles from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While the Ohio outbreak seemed a better comparison than the New York one because it occurred outside a large metro area, there were sharp differences between the 2014 cluster and that in Gaines, underscoring the unique challenges Texas health officials and beyond were up against.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Ohio, most measles cases were located in areas that reported an overall 95% vaccination, enough to ensure herd immunity. More importantly, the Ohio outbreak had occurred before the coronavirus pandemic, years before vaccination fatigue from a global pandemic set in.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By comparison, Gaines County’s vaccination rate had dropped far below the herd immunity level, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/04/west-texas-measles-outbreak-mennonite-seminole/"&gt;to 82%&lt;/a&gt; and the number of seventh graders who had filed a conscientious exemption for at least one vaccination with local schools, had grown from 2% in 2014, long before COVID-19,of seventh graders had a vaccination exemption. In 2024, it was nearly 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas outbreak also involved a more mobile population. Seminole in Gaines County is located 35 miles from New Mexico and involved a largely unvaccinated population that traveled often long distances: to Mennonite communities in Mexico and Canada as well as those located in northeastern Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their penchant for traveling made it harder for public officials to contain the spread, which eventually would lead to cases in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;Oklahoma, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas, Illinois, Colorado and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5741ba72-fa6a-494f-917e-c9c134b4777a" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Undercounting of measles cases&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;To better track the spread and stop it, the state has worked with local providers and health departments to carefully document exactly how many measles infections occur. To do that, public health officials rely on local providers and hospitals to inform them when there is a case.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;However, that number is likely an undercount because it is based on patients treated, not those who ride out the virus from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Statistically, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/measles-is-making-a-comeback-can-we-stop-it-202503063091"&gt;up to three measles cases per every 1,000 &lt;/a&gt;measles results in death. Gaines had two deaths, which would indicate the number of infections were far greater than the 441 reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Not everybody who gets sick goes to the hospital,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Among the more popular places for infected Mennonites to seek out health care was with Lubbock physician Ben Edwards, who treated hundreds of patients in a temporary clinic in Seminole. The Mennonite’s skepticism of mainstream medicine elevated Edwards — who denounced vaccines and promoted vitamin A and budesonide, something more commonly used to treat asthma, as alternative prevention and treatment options — to a medical hero for the religious community.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While the local hospital in Seminole regularly reported to Holbrooks’ office every measles patient it treated, information from local providers, such as Edwards, was tougher to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was frustrating,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Reporting cases quickly to local health authorities helps them respond more quickly to keep disease from spreading, as well as to keep cases from becoming more serious where hospitalization is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Emails obtained by The Texas Tribune through a public information request hint at how Holbrooks’ office had to spend extra time retrieving that information from Edwards, who like all physicians&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/IDCU/investigation/Reporting-forms/notifiable-conditions-2025-bw.pdf"&gt; are to report “immediately” to local or regional health officials&lt;/a&gt; measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I’ve seen multiple news reports indicating that your clinic in Seminole has treated upwards of 300 individuals for measles in Gaines County,” Holbrooks wrote Edwards in an April 14 letter, three months after the first measles case. “After reviewing our records, we have not received any corresponding case reports from your office.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Eventually Holbrooks’ office received a list of patient names and their dates of birth but few other details. Edward apologized for the lateness, attributing it to a communication error with a community translator who was assisting him with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“She and I had a miscommunication, as I had instructed her to send that list to the local health authority but she thought I had sent it,” Edwards told the Tribune. “Once I was made aware of this oversight, it was immediately corrected.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5909fc21-1383-4b0c-8256-f06fb014ea06" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Lessons learned &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health officials’ measles messaging focused on getting the word out on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Once he reached out to community leaders, Holbrooks worked to get public health messaging aired in both English and the Mennonites’ dialect of informal or Low German.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Holbrooks had wanted to put more vaccination and field clinics closer to the Mennonites but quickly saw that doing so would attract too much attention. News of the outbreak brought a sudden influx of national reporters to tiny Seminole, forcing many locals to shy away from pop-up vaccination clinics where TV cameras and photographers were stationed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Eventually, Seminole health workers moved to a drive-through vaccination clinic through their local show barn, a local livestock exhibition facility used by youth groups, allowing more privacy for those interested in obtaining a measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even 75 miles north in Lubbock, Wells, the city’s public health director, found that public vaccination spots, while often a hallmark of back-to-school events in August, were not as big a draw in the larger city.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Both she and Holbrooks recognized later that focusing on vaccination from the start could have sent a message that vaccines were the only option for treatment, possibly dissuading more susceptible residents or those with milder measles cases from asking questions or getting more help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We should have one more of a treatment clinic [model] and had more boots on the ground, working with churches … to engage better with the Mennonite community,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;These vaccine clinics could have been made less clinical and paired with other options, such as checking oxygen levels and passing out Pedialyte to help infected patients stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Such an approach could have invited more visitors and conversation, resulting in better triaging of residents and letting them know to seek more help from the local hospitals, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We should have found a way to set up something that was free, kind of caring for people with measles, not saying you’re like this infectious person,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From inside Seminole Memorial Hospital, Parkey said his facility was fending for itself as measles cases began arriving in force in February and March.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He would have liked more outreach to the private medical care sector from state and local public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We couldn’t stop seeing people. Someone could [have] come out and talk to us,” Parkey said, adding that his experience with public health during COVID was similar. “No one talked to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He wished he had more help with offering &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;faster test results to patients&lt;/a&gt;. Most hospitals either contracted with local testing labs or sent patient samples for testing in the state’s lab in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Parkey said the emphasis at the start of the outbreak on vaccines didn’t change minds, especially among his Mennonite patients and he believes it may have hardened the vaccine skepticism of many. In both measles-related deaths, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;anti-vaccine outfits&lt;/a&gt; like Children’s Health Defense stoked doubt about whether the virus was the cause of the children’s fatalities or if it was something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The group’s founder, current U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/29/texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/"&gt;came to Seminole&lt;/a&gt; after the death of a second child and met with Mennonite families. Although Kennedy is no longer with the group, his history of &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/factcheck-org-kennedy-cites-flawed-paper-in-bid-to-justify-vaccine-autism-link/"&gt;false statements about vaccines&lt;/a&gt; together with that personal visit reinforced for many the view that the government should stay out of individual health decisions particularly related to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Anywhere you have a bunch of people who don’t believe in vaccines, you’re going to see it,” he said of downplaying measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells admits that one of the lessons from COVID is that public health officials had a &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/18/texas-covid-pandemic-readiness/"&gt;hard time learning to bend and pivot quickly in reaction&lt;/a&gt; to both the ever-morphing virus and the growing knowledge about who was at the greatest risk. By not communicating effectively and immediately when restrictions and advice changed, the public felt a constant whiplash of conflicting information and quickly began tuning out medical updates and vaccination alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the number of measles cases began to taper in April and May, so did the messaging, a sign perhaps that public health is learning to pivot more quickly to a community’s reaction to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Vaccination was — and is still — touted as the best preventive measure against becoming infected by local and state public health officials. But, by &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/09/west-texas-measles-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;early April&lt;/a&gt;, three days after Kennedy’s Seminole visit, the state health agency posted guidance about vitamin A dosage in response to requests from infected residents for ways to ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We kind of shifted to harm reduction,” said Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We always want to give the message that’s going to do the most good to people. If that means vaccination messaging takes a back seat, then we have to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;

I was getting closer to what I would describe as a nebula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a big cloud of colors moving that were changing. Everything was vivid stars. I was just floating peacefully.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna initially dismissed her symptoms as the flu which her children had recently recovered from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna suffered a major heart attack—also known as a 'widow-maker' heart attack given its scarily low survival rate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not once did I remember or relive any bad parts of life. Everything that I thought about was the connections I had made with people or places while I was alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was just all the good stuff.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, family members had called emergency services—medics arrived just 13 minutes later and were able to resuscitate her, saving her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Referring to Ms Tanner as a 'miracle' case, her cardiologist said: 'In a 20-year career and over 4,000 surgeries, I've never seen anything like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't even know people could survive this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Ms Tanner arrived in hospital, cardiologists implanted a heart pump and a stent to widen the narrowed artery—a procedure which usually requires heart bypass surgery—and restore blood flow to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after just ten days in hospital—six of which she spent in intensive care—the mother-of-three walked out on her own, unaided by doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet her recovery has been far from easy, seeing her gain almost three stone—which she has since lost—and suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna's X-ray shows a blockage in the LMCA, which supplies most of the heart muscle with life-giving blood and oxygen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fire department reached Jenna's home within 13 minutes, providing a life-saving service which saw Jenna walk out of hospital just 10 days after suffering a serious heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has to take thirteen different types of medication to manage her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fire department, which came to Ms Tanner's rescue as it was closest to where she lived, has since received an award for reaching her in record time and providing life-saving care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A widowmaker heart attack occurs when a blood clot completely obstructs the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the most critical artery of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within minutes, this can cut-off life-giving oxygen to the heart and the muscle can die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if a person receives immediate treatment, this sort of heart attack can cause irreversible tissue damage that can permanently affect the functioning of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now urging health authorities to update current guidelines so more people can be tested for early warning signs—potentially saving thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tanner’s case comes amid a worrying rise in premature deaths from heart attacks and strokes, which last year reached their highest level in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MailOnline has previously reported that the number of under-40s treated by the NHS for heart attacks is also climbing, with soaring obesity rates and related health issues believed to be key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, around 420 people of working age die of as a result of heart disease each week, totalling an alarming 21,975 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease is America's number one killer and nearly 1million people die of it every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16a07" class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people — the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e505" class="body-graf"&gt;From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what’s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724" target="_blank"&gt;higher BMI in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1f6b" class="body-graf"&gt;The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person’s risk of obesity as an adult — before they even turn 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afce6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Childhood is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651" target="_blank"&gt;best time to intervene&lt;/a&gt;,” said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa156c" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c37dc3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice as effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ae5e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The new test is not the first that predicts a person’s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30290-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302909%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;polygenetic score&lt;/a&gt; can account for about 8.5% of a person’s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2fSAVZBVV95cUxNVXdnVUQ4OXhzNlJiUmJGbjBJYjNsbEhKcWdPZ2pYNHhyUnkzY3FhZmlfNTdfd05UakMtazNGcmxVd1lzZW4xTV84SG5ZRGdSLXhnYUNFUQ</guid></item><item><title>基因检测可以预测肥胖的几率，从而进行早期干预- NBC新闻 | A genetic test could predict the odds of obesity, allowing for early interventions - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c517a0" class="body-graf"&gt;A genetic test may one day predict a child’s risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-dipped-us-adults-rcna183952" target="_blank"&gt;obesity in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd846c" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain genetic variants can affect how a person’s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating.

The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c</guid></item><item><title>青少年正试图大量摄入蛋白质补充剂。父母应该注意什么？ - NPR | Teens are trying to bulk up on protein supplements.

                &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/a&gt; last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals.

   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school, and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine," he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: "My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of body building and the gyms."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Protein supplements are big on social media, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;influencers are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day," says &lt;a href="https://chear.org/people/faculty-investigators/sarah-clark" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sarah Clark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research scientist and co-director of &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good," she says. "We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy," she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78474" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietician Abriana Cain says.

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much is enough? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is also such a thing as &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;protein, says Abriana Cain, a &lt;a href="https://www.childrensnational.org/get-care/departments/clinical-nutrition-services/meet-the-team" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric dietician with Children's National Hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt, and a cup of black beans.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidney and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. "They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. &lt;a href="https://nagatalab.ucsf.edu/people/jason-nagata-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Supplement%20Health%20and%20Education%20Act%20(DSHEA)%20amended%20the,has%20not%20been%20chemically%20altered." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; regulated by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — so they're not tested, and their ingredients aren't verified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle building supplements and products," he says. "I would just be very cautious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies. Some products have been found to have contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, or chemicals or adulterants not listed on the label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Eating disorders are up&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Separately, Nagata is concerned that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7483647/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein craze is contributing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812520?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2023.46012" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarming &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813513#:~:text=A%20study%20in%20Canada%20of,of%20improved%20screening%20and%20detection." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase in eating disorders among boys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past two decades, worldwide. He observes that over that time period, action figures like Batman and Superman are sold with bigger muscles, and pressures on ordinary teenagers to post attractive photos of themselves to be popular online have increased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The masculine body ideal has become increasingly large and muscular, and so more and more boys are trying to become muscular now than they have ever before," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky stopped using protein powders about a year ago, he says, largely because he started forgetting to take it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His father, Eduardo, says his son still looks very strong and fit, but is no longer fixated with bulking up for sports. "He's focusing on getting into college."&lt;/p&gt;

The body does not react to cholesterol build-up in the arteries until there is a blockage, which can lead to heart attacks (reduced blood flow to the heart) and stroke (oxygen being cut-off to the brain).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If not treated on time, it can lead to disability and even death. In fact, as per a WHO estimate, raised cholesterol levels are behind 2.6 million deaths and 29.7 million disability-adjusted life years globally each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/12/17/550x309/h_1671275024049_1671275057480_1671275057480.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Cholesterol are fat-like substances that help in the making of hormones.

However, high amounts of cholesterol can cause cardiovascular diseases.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of symptoms in conditions like dyslipidemia leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, missing the critical window for preventive intervention and lifestyle correction. Most patients do not seek medical help until it is too late, mainly because the symptoms which have been enlisted below are too common place and ranges from:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling out of breath during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart Palpitations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about the condition in an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Nihar Mehta, interventional cardiologist at Jaslok Hospital in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mumbai, shared, “Dyslipidemia is a highly treatable condition and can be managed with proper medication and lifestyle changes. Total cholesterol test looks for levels of LDL (bad cholesterol), HDL (good cholesterol), and Triglycerides. For high-risk population, those with familial hypercholesterolemia, obesity and diabetes, an inherited disease that causes high LDL levels, routine lipid profiling, especially in high-risk or sedentary individuals, is essential to detect dyslipidemia early and initiate timely management to avoid long-term complications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The optimal lipid level varies depending on the individual’s age, sex and other risk factors but generally, the following ranges are recommended:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; more than 40 mg/dL for men and more than 50 mg/dL for women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triglycerides:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 150 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; less than 200 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips to beat this deadly cholesterol disorder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting healthier habits can significantly improve lipid profiles and reduce cardiovascular risks. Dr Mehta suggested, “Lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help manage but not necessarily cure dyslipidemia. Regular medication adherence is essential for better outcomes. If lipid is higher than optimal, avoid foods high in cholesterol, saturated fats, trans fats, added sugars and salt. Make sure to exercise for at least 150 minutes every week. Maintaining a healthy weight and body mass index, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake are all recommended.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/07/04/Pictures/_84664e3e-41a0-11e6-8e05-c384b245cd95.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="NAFLD can also lead to insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cautioned, “Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease can affect lipid levels or increase the risk of cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is important to remain compliant with all medications and be consistent with follow-ups with your healthcare provider. A proactive approach is essential for preventing complications and protecting long-term heart health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

As such, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective anticancer compounds, particularly those derived from medicinal plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study reveal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the research team used a specific bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T, to ferment stevia leaves. They compared the fermented version (which they call FSLE) to regular stevia extract and found that FSLE performed better in every way they tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Masanori Sugiyama explained, “To enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural plant extracts, microbial biotransformation has emerged as an effective strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They optimized the fermentation process and found that stevia was most effective when fermented for 72 hours, at 37°C, without oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were impressive: fermented stevia effectively killed pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) while barely affecting healthy cells, even at higher doses. This selectivity is crucial for safe cancer treatments. Instead of an immediate kill, FSLE sometimes slowed down cancer cell growth, making them look weak and unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia also showed strong antioxidant properties, which is essential since oxidative stress is a big factor in cancer development. It neutralized free radicals more effectively than the non-fermented version, achieving a 94% scavenging power in one test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the takeaway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that fermentation transforms compounds into more active versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a compound called chlorogenic acid is converted into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME) during fermentation. CAME was found to be more effective than regular chlorogenic acid in halting cancer cell growth and triggering cancer cell self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its potency was significant: the dose needed to kill half the cancer cells was much lower for CAME compared to regular chlorogenic acid. CAME works by blocking the cell cycle and forcing cells into apoptosis, their self-destruct mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a genetic level, CAME influenced genes associated with cell death, activating pro-apoptotic genes while shutting down those that prevent cell death. This supports the observed effects, showing that CAME doesn’t just kill cells randomly; it drives them into a specific self-destruction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up in simpler terms, this research suggests that fermented stevia could be a promising new avenue for effective cancer treatment, particularly for hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is stevia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is a sweet sugar substitute that is about 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It is extracted from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant (shrub) native to tropical and subtropical America, and areas of Paraguay and Brazil. The active compounds in stevia are steviol glycosides, and the leaves may be used as a calorie-free substitute for sugar. Stevia is heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than just a sweetener:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is not just a substitute for sugar anymore; it’s stepping up its game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to fermentation, researchers have discovered that stevia extract can be transformed into a compound that fights cancer while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This exciting change is linked to specific enzymes from a bacterial strain called SN13T. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Danshiitsoodol, “This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that this new compound, CAME, is more effective at harming cancer cells and promoting cell death in PANC-1 cells than chlorogenic acid alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The way ahead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for this research? The team has plans to take their work from the lab to the real world, with mouse studies coming up. This will test if fermented stevia can work within living systems, which have complex immune responses and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Danshiitsoodol, “The present study has substantially enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of the Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T strain in the fermentation of herbal extracts, while also offering a valuable research perspective on the potential application of probiotics as natural anti-tumor agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going by this research, with the right microbes, even a simple leaf like stevia could become a powerful weapon against cancer. It’s not bad for a sugar substitute anymore; it’s a natural and valuable component with more than its sweetening qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy may also treat certain autoimmune diseases, claims study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>一位步行专家说，有两种类型的步行，这就是为什么两者对您的健康都很重要- Fit&amp;Well | A walking expert says there are two types of walking, here’s why both are important for your health - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxNQlBzcmNYeHZkZmp2Y2EzN182MHZ6cnUyYk10OGxMeXZjS1hBNEg1VWg2VURCY2dlRG5FLWpBUVRoS0VCbDhEbGhiOUk5ZDBIUXNVWnNRMVgwZ183YmY0LTl3VkJHWFBGWmtCR1ZfOEg4dENCcnhjRTBqc084SS1aczlhRnozYm1aUlZnRkVKRW8tVTF1UWJLa01BNkhVMEt3eVc1eUJjZFQ3bVR6R2RubE43cVJLck1kZ3kwQmxIRUhIZ1MxZ3BxNGljV1V0ckpJN050amNTbko?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

Walking for exercise falls into this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pJzCsoW2u6F95s4aGbq6zi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pJzCsoW2u6F95s4aGbq6zi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are cardiovascular and muscular conditioning benefits to intentional walking: your heart rate increases, your stress levels decrease and your mood lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you and I were to go out for a 10-minute intentional walk, we’re getting into a rhythm,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re breathing rhythmically, our arms are swinging and the pelvis is rotating a little bit. Your nervous system is getting into a rhythm with all that movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentional walks don’t have to be particularly long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A five-minute walk is called a micro walk,” says McDowell. “If you can add even five more minutes of walking a day, you will still see a difference in your longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-minute intentional walk could help you get an extra 500 steps, which can have a big impact on your health, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;showed that increasing daily steps by 500 (from a 2,500 baseline) reduced the chances of death from cardiovascular causes by 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell also suggests partnering up for your intentional walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inviting someone along on a walk will generally make the walk longer, therefore more effective,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnered walks also have a positive impact on mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it’s great to have a certain step count and it’s great to do it in the right shoes, by walking with someone we can also take care of filling up our social cup and making sure that we’re engaging with our community, which can have positive impacts on mental health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ambient-walking"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ambient walking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell explains that ambient walking is the kind of walking you do when wandering around your apartment or letting your pet out to toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ambient walking is typically broken up, which is why we categorize a longer duration walk as intentional because you are priming your entire system and getting into a steady state” says McDowell, “versus ‘I’ve got up to go and get coffee,’ or ‘I picked up my newspaper,’ or ‘I took the dog for a spin around the block’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those ambient walking steps still count, but they provide a different type of benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t get the cardiovascular and muscular conditioning boost that you would from an intentional walk, but ambient walking still contributes to calorie burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as you’re walking, we’re happy,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambient walking steps also reflect time that you aren’t spending sitting still, which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting for long periods is associated with a slower metabolic rate, which leads to issues with blood sugar, blood pressure and fat breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sitting is the new smoking,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting up and wandering around your office space or getting a cup of coffee can break up longer periods of sitting and mitigate some of the negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware that to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in"&gt;increase your step count safely&lt;/a&gt;, you need to increase it slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are walking 2,500 steps a day, you should only increase by a maximum of 250 steps a week to avoid injury.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surgeons at Duke University have resuscitated a 'dead' heart on the operating table after it stopped beating for more than five minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organ was later transplanted into the chest of a three-month-old child, saving their life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant with the donor heart continued to show normal cardiac function and no signs of organ rejection at six months of age, according to a brief report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-personality-changes-sometimes-happen-after-organ-transplants?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Eerie Personality Changes Sometimes Happen After Organ Transplants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story is proof that the concept of 'on-table reanimation' works at preserving hearts for transplantation – at least for infants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the consent of the donor family, surgeons reinvigorated a small donor heart on the operating table using an oxygenator, a centrifugal pump, and a hanging reservoir to collect expelled blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contraption had to be custom-designed, as current care systems that keep organs alive outside of bodies are too big for infant hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today in the United States, up to 20 percent of infants in need will die waiting for a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most organ donors must be declared brain dead before donation. Only 0.5 percent of pediatric heart transplants are donated after circulatory death, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when the heart stops beating and blood stops circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some critics do not think it is morally correct to take &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/100950"&gt;a terminal patient off life support&lt;/a&gt;, get their heart beating again, and then remove it for transplantation. Concerns arise over declarations of death, and how to reanimate organs in an ethical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After circulatory death, donor hearts can be re-oxygenated while they are still in the donor body, or they can be resuscitated on the operating table using machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png" alt="Organ Donation" class="size-medium wp-image-168331" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-683x415.png 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-768x467.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-600x365.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Organ donation sources and techniques.

They also note that using organs after circulatory death has the potential to increase the donor pool by up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another team of surgeons at Vanderbilt University has a different idea.

It might actually protect your heart! This humble cup of tea might just be the heart’s best-kept secret. Yes, that’s right. Beyond its comforting warmth and rich aroma, black tea may have many health benefits that keep you healthy later in life. Scientists now believe that this popular beverage may hold the power to reduce the risk of life-threatening conditions like heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Edith Cowan University (ECU) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.318408" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, black tea is good for cardiovascular health. But how does a simple brew wield such strength? Let’s take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Put the kettle on!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Black tea has many heart-protective properties, thanks to its flavonoids. Flavonoids are naturally occurring substances found in many common foods and beverages, such as black tea. The protective effects of black tea are long known; however, the ECU research found that they may be even better for us than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the health benefits of black tea, the researchers observed 881 elderly women (median age of 80), who consumed black tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that these participants were far less likely to have an extensive build-up of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) as they consumed a high level of flavonoids in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAC is the calcification of the abdominal aorta, the largest artery in the body, which supplies oxygenated blood from the heart to the abdominal organs and lower limbs, and is a predictor of cardiovascular risk, such as heart attack and stroke. It is also a reliable predictor for late-life dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Not a fan of tea? Don’t worry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A daily cup of tea could help you to enjoy better health late in life, however, what if you’re not a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/warning-drinking-too-much-tea-can-cause-heart-palpitations-anxiety-and-other-health-risks/articleshow/122422561.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; drinker? Well don’t worry, there are other things you can add to your diet. The researchers found that you can still reap the benefits by adding certain foods and beverages, which are rich in flavonoids. “In most populations, a small group of foods and beverages, uniquely high in flavonoids, contribute the bulk of total dietary flavonoid intake. The main contributors are usually black or green tea, blueberries, strawberries, oranges, red wine, apples, raisins, or grapes, and dark chocolate,” Ben Parmenter, who led the study, and is a researcher at the ECU Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The mighty flavonoids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavonoids are a diverse group of phytonutrients (plant-based compounds), known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds are found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-derived foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of flavonoids, such as flavan-3-ols and flavonols, which the study indicated appear to also have a link with AAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants who took high amounts of total flavonoids, flavan-3-ols and flavonols were 36% to 39% less likely to have extensive AAC. Black tea was the main source of total flavonoids in this study and it was associated with significantly lower odds of extensive AAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who had two to six cups of tea per day had 16% to 42% less chance of having extensive AAC, compared to people who are non-tea drinkers. However, a few other dietary sources of flavonoids such as fruit juice, red wine, and chocolate, did not show a significant beneficial association with AAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Not just tea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though black tea was the main source of flavonoids in the study, the researchers said people could still benefit from flavonoids without putting the kettle on. “Out of the women who don’t drink black tea, higher total non-tea flavonoid intake also appears to protect against extensive calcification of the arteries. This implies flavonoids from sources other than black tea may be protective against AAC when tea is not consumed,” Mr Parmenter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Supreme Court Pushes Central Govt to Finalise FOPL: What It Means &amp;amp; Why It Matters? | Explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that looking at other sources of this was important as it allows non-tea drinkers to still benefit from flavonoids in their diet. “In other populations or groups of people, such as young men or people from other countries, black tea might not be the main source of flavonoids. AAC is a major predictor of vascular disease events, and this study shows intake of flavonoids, that could protect against AAC, is easily achievable in most people’s diets,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_gFBVV95cUxQSXU4V2c1cl9OZ2hPSEtKWTgzMk9zSGVQYmlxejU4clp6RzBCbE1aT0NaOGlCd29Td3RsZUMzQjQ2R181ZF9uSVNuUFphMlQ1OUd4RGlUOVhBbW9YSjNQdUdCV0FSbjR5UmUxeGxKbGRlT1F5dFZKNlVONlhobUlGV0dfSGFxR09QYWNPTlB4aDBzTVhMOWljT3BtQ1gtRDVSQWdOQ1ZUNHlEODZVMWh5ZHFfT0ctQ1J6OXJ5NHFYYUVTWnVVcXdCeC1hTHVYajBmNDcwSksyWVhYamhPVjhqRzFLNnQ2OWVwcU1rTm1SUnpHT29mUWExeHY3NTlUdw</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌：美国胃肠病学家分享6种可以降低结肠癌风险的零食想法-印度时报 | Colon Cancer: US Gastroenterologist shares 6 snack ideas that can reduce colon cancer risk - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is increasingly common, especially among younger adults.

One clinical trial (published earlier this year in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/18/4/235/754306/Systemic-Inflammation-and-the-Inflammatory-Context" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer Prevention Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) showed 28 g of walnuts daily reduced inflammation markers and vimentin levels, proteins tied to aggressive colon tumors.

Aim for a daily nut handful or mix walnuts into trail mix or oatmeal for an antioxidant boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apples&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An apple a day might even keep the big C (cancer) at bay. Apples, especially with their skin, offer soluble and insoluble fiber plus flavonoids.

Fiber aids bowel regularity and toxin removal, while phytonutrients support gut health. Snack on apple slices with almond butter or part of a lunch fruit salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrating and fiber‑rich citrus fruits, like oranges, grapefruits, and clementines, are not only high in fiber, but their water content, vitamins, and bioactive compounds also add to their numerous health benefits. A study, published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55219-5?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, shows citrus intake may decrease colorectal cancer risk by up to 18%. The combination of antioxidants, fiber, and hydration supports digestion and reduces carcinogen exposure in the colon. Moreover, you can enjoy them fresh, in smoothies, or sprinkled in salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made of over 90% water, watermelon aids hydration and regular digestion. This luscious fruit is not only crucial for colon health, but the lycopene and antioxidants in watermelon contribute anti-inflammatory benefits, slashing the risk of colorectal cancer considerably. What’s more? Fresh watermelon slices or blended into agua fresca are a refreshing addition to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salsa and guacamole&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one, we hardly see it coming! Tomato-based salsa provides lycopene and fiber, while avocado adds monounsaturated fats, fiber (about 10 g per medium avocado), and antioxidants. Mix them together for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8270321/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a gut‑health powerhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. As per research, superfruit avocado consumption has been shown to lower colon cancer risk. Moreover, tomatoes and avocados together offer synergistic benefits.

    &lt;p&gt;Semen, sperm, spunk, cum, ejaculate, pre-cum, seminal fluid. These are just some of the many words we use to describe what comes out of an erect penis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these terms can be used interchangeably, but they’re not all the same. Do you know the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is sperm?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26914/"&gt;male reproductive (sex) cells&lt;/a&gt;. The word “sperm” can refer to spermatozoon (singular) or spermatozoa (plural).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm are tiny cells with an oval-shaped body and a long tail. They measure just &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/andr.12500"&gt;1/20th&lt;/a&gt; of a millimetre in length and can only be seen with a microscope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sperm are produced in the two &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23964-testicles"&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt; (testicles). The testes are glands located inside the scrotum (the skin sac underneath where the penis is attached to the body).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The testes begin producing sperm at puberty. Sperm production then continues &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26914/"&gt;throughout adult life&lt;/a&gt;, beginning to decline around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4818633/"&gt;age 40&lt;/a&gt;. The testes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10095/"&gt;make about&lt;/a&gt; 200 million sperm every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop, sperm &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10889116/"&gt;need a temperature range&lt;/a&gt; of 34–35°C, which is lower than core body temperature (usually &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/fever"&gt;between 36 and 37°C&lt;/a&gt;). This is why the testes are located in the cooler scrotum and not in the abdomen or pelvis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each sperm carries &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Chromosome"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, which are made up of DNA and genes. When a sperm cell fertilises a female reproductive cell (an ovum or egg), the genetic information of the sperm and ovum combines to form an embryo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is semen?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ejaculated sperm has to reach the uterine (&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/inaccurate-and-misogynistic-why-we-need-to-make-the-term-hysterectomy-history-257972"&gt;fallopian&lt;/a&gt;) tubes to fertilise an egg. This is a long journey, so sperm are carried in a fluid that nourishes and protects it (seminal fluid). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semen is the mix of sperm and seminal fluid together. It is Latin for “seed” &lt;a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/semen"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;serere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “to sow”. Semen only exists outside the body, because sperm and seminal fluid only combine at the point of ejaculation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seminal fluid is &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/reproductive/male/glands.html"&gt;made in&lt;/a&gt; the sex glands. These are the seminal vesicles and prostate, which sit just behind and below the bladder, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Semen is about 10% sperm.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/male-reproductive-system-median-section-127210979"&gt;Alila Medical Media/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/reproductive/male/glands.html"&gt;seminal vesicles&lt;/a&gt; produce a thick, gel-like substance. It clumps the sperm together immediately after ejaculation and provides the sperm with energy (fructose) to survive their journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fluid is alkaline – the opposite to acidic – which protects sperm in the &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/vaginal-ph-balance"&gt;more acidic&lt;/a&gt; vagina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prostate secretes a &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/reproductive/male/glands.html"&gt;thinner, milky fluid&lt;/a&gt; with acids that &lt;a href="https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/1001105"&gt;liquefy&lt;/a&gt; the semen. This helps the sperm to separate from the initial clump so they can travel through the cervix and uterus to the uterine tubes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prostate also provides &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589359/"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, which is essential for sperm survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ejaculating &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538429/"&gt;secretes these fluids and sperm&lt;/a&gt; into the urethra, the narrow tube that runs through the penis and also transports urine. At this point, they combine as semen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semen &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787"&gt;is about&lt;/a&gt; 10% sperm and 90% fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What happens after ejaculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787"&gt;Ejaculating&lt;/a&gt; usually produces between 1.5 and 5 millilitres of semen, and each mL contains anywhere between &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/normal-sperm-count#:%7E:text=A%20typical%20sperm%20count%20ranges%20from%2015%20million,sperm%20count%20is%20often%20referred%20to%20as%20oligospermia."&gt;15 and 200 million sperm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If semen is ejaculated into a vagina, sperm have to travel &lt;a href="https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/clinical-anatomy-of-the-uterus-fallopian-tubes-and-ovaries/item/1"&gt;around 15 centimetres&lt;/a&gt; to reach the uterine tubes, which is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23184-fallopian-tubes"&gt;most common site&lt;/a&gt; for fertilisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest and healthiest sperm travel this distance – about 3,000 times their body length – in &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/ss/slideshow-conception"&gt;only 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a human of average height, this equates to swimming about 5 kilometres in half an hour. That means sperm can swim twice as fast as the current &lt;a href="https://www.worldaquatics.com/news/2657419/wellbrock-and-cunha-claim-open-water-5km-fina-world-championship-titles"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; for a 5km open water swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does ‘pre-cum’ have sperm in it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aroused and erect penis can secrete up to 4mL of pre-ejaculate (pre-cum), which is completely different to semen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-ejaculate is produced by different sex glands – the small &lt;a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bulbourethral-glands"&gt;bulbourethral glands&lt;/a&gt; that sit just under the prostate. It is a mucus fluid that lubricates and flushes out the urethra in the penis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, pre-ejaculate doesn’t contain sperm. However, one small &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3564677/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found the pre-ejaculate of about 40% of men they studied contained sperm, though in very low numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of getting pregnant from pre-ejaculate is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782424002506"&gt;very low – but not zero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can semen say about your overall health?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semen is usually creamy-white or pale grey. It often has a faint ammonia or bleach smell, because of its &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326242#:%7E:text=Normal%20semen%20is%20slightly%20alkaline,or%20ammonia%2C%20which%20is%20normal."&gt;alkaline pH&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However its colour, consistency and smell &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/facts-about-semen-an-indication-of-health-status-2328524"&gt;can vary between people&lt;/a&gt; and even on different days for the same person.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If semen has a foul odour, it &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326242#semen-health-tips"&gt;may indicate an infection&lt;/a&gt; and should be checked by a doctor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Contraception and fertility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/vasectomy"&gt;vasectomy&lt;/a&gt; is a form of male contraceptive.  This involves cutting &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22763-vas-deferens"&gt;the two vas deferens&lt;/a&gt; – the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the urethra. After a vasectomy, ejaculating will produce slightly less semen and it won’t contain sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(24)00523-7/fulltext"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have also started for a new potential &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-enters-clinical-trials-for-the-first-time"&gt;male contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt; that blocks sperm production in the testes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4429439/#:%7E:text=Oxidative%20stress%20resulting%20from%20excessive,to%20standard%20male%20fertility%20investigation."&gt;Oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress"&gt;an imbalance&lt;/a&gt; of too many damaging chemicals and not enough antioxidants – has a negative impact on sperm health and strongly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7222198/"&gt;contributes to male infertility&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has published a range of values for semen volume and sperm number, concentration, movement and structure among fertile males. However, low sperm count does not always mean lower fertility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20905998.2024.2421626#abstract"&gt;keep sperm healthy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s recommended to eat a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and not smoke, use recreational drugs or drink a lot of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

It's the place where you're likely spending most of your time, and if it's not promoting healthy habits, a consistent routine, or peacefulness, you're going to feel drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From hurting sleep quality, to sabotaging connection, heightening stress, and even negatively impacting physical well-being, the little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy are significant, yet difficult to notice in the grand scheme of things. Many may be overspending on objects or allowing certain things into their space without even realizing they're negatively impacting their own mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Morgan Birch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;How measles spread in Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Morgan Birch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;How measles spread in Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations. With measles having been largely eliminated, families likely did not prioritise getting their kids' vaccinations up to date, Dr Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That is not the case for Ms Birch, who began routine immunisations for her baby Kimie as soon as she was eligible. But Kimie was still too young for the measles vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Suttorp said Alberta has since lowered that age cap in response to the recent outbreak, and there has been an uptick in people taking the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health units across the country have also tried to encourage people to get vaccinated through public bulletins and radio advertisements. But the response is notably more muted than that during the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie has since slowly recovered, Ms Birch said, though she continues to be monitored for potential long-term effects of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Alberta mother said she was saddened and horrified when she learned her daughter had measles, but also "frustrated and annoyed" at those choosing not to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She called on people to heed public health guidelines and "protect the ones that can't protect themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My four-month-old shouldn't have gotten measles in 2025," Ms Birch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9mNDVwYzgzanoxbDBoLVhRaENVWXFLc3NNMUdPTnhuUEx4WU5xQVJ1YmVPTWMtYXZ2VksyMVBWU2h0djNiY05oSTlnWmFucU5xNEY3cWhiWVRXZw</guid></item><item><title>与癌症疾病相关的刷牙.. -大安得拉邦 | Brushing Teeth Linked To Cancer Disease.. - Great Andhra</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNOTJ2LVVhT253Y0xTSkxKU2tUaHlBajB1RW1Id1poN1Nrb3hVR2RlUGV2Rm9ydTk0MmxqYnZXMFZ3R1hKQ0Y3elFVaWxXQzNyRXJQbWEtc01OM011aHo1MkJnMkdDTFB5allRMHUxOHRtLU9FY3F4TjQ5NHRWUXJEMWI2b1B5RS1ralBNX2NFcmdhVkZzSlVucnpSVDlrdTlYcUHSAZABQVVfeXFMTXhzSjNhdkYtak03WU9GZzNtY0VfY3gyYXdtdDhCQ0J2UG11Ukc4REFpQnV3WU5wNUhqRFBpUjJWT1NvUlp5bXRrLVBPVl9vcm5IMDV4RHlORE5jaEI1ZGpuYXlIZnQwd2p0aDJXaVJHWlRCT1ZoWTB6X2JleGxoMTJSbzZfYVptT29VQ1VqU0N6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="unselectable"&gt;

					
						
												&lt;p&gt;A recent AIIMS Delhi study highlights the critical role of oral health in preventing and managing serious illnesses, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasized that oral hygiene practices must be integrated into all levels of healthcare, not just at the primary level, to improve overall health outcomes and reduce disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence links poor oral hygiene with conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and especially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gum disease, in particular, shows strong association with cancers of the head, neck, lungs, breast and digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from international studies revealed that routine dental care, like brushing daily and visiting the dentist annually; can reduce the risk of head and neck cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment, especially radiotherapy, significantly affects oral health. Patients with poor gum health face higher complications after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, maintaining oral hygiene before, during and after therapy is essential for better recovery and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study calls for better data from South Asia, awareness campaigns, school-based brushing programs and policies restricting sugar and tobacco promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recommend that WHO South-East Asia Region implement affordable, evidence, based oral health programs to reduce cancer risks and health inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public awareness, supervised brushing and policy changes could help transform oral healthcare in India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Had we not met Dr Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ben Trotman, 43, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022, is now showing no signs of the disease after being administered an immunotherapy drug in a world first two years ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most patients with the aggressive form of brain cancer typically die within 12-to-18 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Trotman went on to have the current standard treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He also undergoes quarterly cans, which continue to return clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We obviously don't know what the future holds but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and I a bit of hope,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trial, from University College London Hospital's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, follows a previous one on the same drug which closed because of lack of recruitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dame Siobhain McDonagh MP lead a fundraising campaign to raise more than £1million to cover the costs of the new trials after her sister, Baroness McDonagh, died from glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dame Siobhain said: 'My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Changing this was Margaret's final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret's Trial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Mulholland said: 'When I met Margaret she said to me 'what can I do to support you to cure this disease?'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Paul Mulholland with Dame Siobhan McDonagh.

The tend to come on really, really quickly, within a matter of seconds. You don't usually have a warning and they will knock you down to the floor until they're over.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller, who lives in Montana, spent much of his adult life suffering attacks up to four times a day for months at a time until they suddenly disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His clusters have slowed in recent years, but like the 1 in 1,000 Americans with the disorder, Zeller waits for the next attack with limited tools at his disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his newly released book, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction – and a Search for Relief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Zeller detailed his decades–long search for cluster headache relief, along with the wackiest things he's tried to quell the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Journalist Tom Zeller Jr's new book explores treatments and causes of cluster headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never wanted to write this book, to be honest. I did not want people to know I had headaches. It's just terrible to be seen in this way,' Zeller told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I also felt like if you're going to write a book, they say, "Write about what you know." I realized that I know headaches.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cluster headaches are extremely painful and strike quickly in frequent attacks, or 'clusters,' lasting weeks or months at a time, earning the grim nickname 'suicide headaches.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorder usually causes sharp and stabbing pain in or around the eye, restlessness, tears and eye redness, forehead sweating, swelling around the eye and eyelid drooping. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14579791/migraines-surprising-cure-effects-doctor-free.html"&gt;close relative of migraines&lt;/a&gt;, they're far less common. About 0.1 percent of Americans have had a cluster headache attack at some point in their lives, while 15 percent – most of whom are women – have migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Zeller, the attacks drove a wedge in his journalism career, often forcing him to 'retreat from opportunities in the newsroom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not easy. The book talks about how any sort of headache disorder is kind of a drag on the momentum of your life. They're always slowing you down,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I wasn't having the headaches, I felt like I was pretty bold and pretty accomplished as a journalist. But when the headaches would come on, I would sort of disappear and I would work from home a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cluster headaches affect one in 1,000 Americans and cause debilitating pain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a lot of stigma attached to headaches in a weird way. I tried very hard to make sure that no one knew that I had these headaches. You start to hide and that meant hiding from opportunities at work too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the book, Zeller detailed a laundry list of unorthodox treatments he tried or researched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was being ground down by the relentless injections, self–administered into an abdomen bruised and pockmarked by previous jabs, and overuse of the medication was likely driving an endless cycle of rebound attacks,' he wrote in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given this unappealing tableau, why not shrooms?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, has been shown to alter how the brain processes and perceives pain signals and is thought to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's also tried inhaling capsaicin, an extract in chili peppers that gives them their signature heat. Some research suggests it helps desensitize nerve fibers in the nasal passages that transmit cluster headache pain to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller also rented oxygen tanks from a welding supplier as a 'really fast way to abort a cluster headache attack.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also remember a forum saying that if you just tried to chug like 60 glasses of water a day, or some absurd amount, it would cure your headaches. I was willing to try, but all I did was visit the toilet a lot with headaches,' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller said many patients with cluster headaches have to rely on bizarre hacks because of the lack of medications geared specifically toward their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is the cover of Tom Zeller Jr's book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing that surprised me most, and what probably prompted the book, was that so little research was out there on primary headache disorders,' Zeller explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are often prescribed beta blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants and other drugs manufactured for other illnesses, as they can treat headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the advent of CGRP drugs has changed the picture. Approved by the FDA in 2018, these preventative drugs block or reduce the effects of CGRP, which causes migraine and cluster headache pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of times you'll find a drug or remedy that does kind of work, but the body adapts. We're very plastic, and over time, those things start to wane,' Zeller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller uses the CGRP medication Emgality, the only FDA approved medication specifically designed for cluster headaches and migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cluster headache dose of Emgality is significantly higher than the migraine dose – 300 milligrams compared to 120 milligrams – and both versions are given through a subcutaneous injection just under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cluster headaches are their own unique animal, so once the headaches start happening, it does seem to be pretty hard to stop,' Zeller revealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I think three times in I'm sort of convinced that the CGRP blockers work for me to stop a bout from happening.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The book opens with him tripping on magic mushrooms for cluster headaches (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like migraines, cluster headaches often become less frequent and severe with age, which some research suggests could be due to hormonal fluctuations and altered blood vessel function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller's clusters in recent years have slowed and can now fall years apart, but he's far from being in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think I, or anyone really, is out of the woods yet,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, Zeller said he hopes his new book will help improve cluster headache awareness and provide a sense of community for readers with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his research, he spoke with several cluster headache and migraine patients who at first were 'guarded' and wary of speaking about their experience over fears of it being trivialized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But throughout the interviews, they became excited because they had 'this pent–up desire to just unload about it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I hope they feel seen by the book,' Zeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Someone out there is paying attention and you can take heart in that, and if you're able to buy time between painful bouts, I hope that you know the book will be affirming in that you know you're not alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds provide fiber, omega-3s and antioxidants that can help lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are versatile, cost-effective and easy to incorporate into a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating plant-based foods, exercising and not smoking are also important for better cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to lowering cholesterol levels, lifestyle changes are key. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292224/high-cholesterol-diet-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, or hypercholesterolemia, occurs when excess cholesterol is present in the blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vandanasheth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt; says, “High cholesterol is linked to diet, genetics and lifestyle. Over time, this can increase your risk for heart disease.” The good news is that even just a few simple tweaks to your diet can make a big difference in managing your cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, adding a sprinkle of chia seeds to your meals is an easy way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boost your intake of soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats—key nutrients for lowering cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, one review showed that consuming 35 grams (about 2.5 tablespoons) of chia seeds per day led to noticeable reductions  in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the control group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here, registered dietitians explain why chia seeds are the #1 food to eat more of if you have high cholesterol, along with other strategies for managing your levels. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are the edible seeds of the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica&lt;/em&gt; plant and are an impressive source of dietary fiber, plant-based protein, antioxidants, omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also naturally low in saturated fat and easy to incorporate into meals and snacks. Here are some of the reasons why adding chia seeds to your diet may be beneficial if you have high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Provide an Ample Amount of Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are rich in fiber, with a 2-tablespoon serving providing 10 grams of fiber, including 1.5 grams of soluble fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to help lower cholesterol by binding to cholesterol in the small intestine and removing it from your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When chia seed is mixed with water, the soluble fiber forms a gel called &lt;em&gt;mucilage,&lt;/em&gt; which can help transport cholesterol out of the body through the digestive tract,” says &lt;a href="http://kristydelcoro.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that consuming at least 5–10 grams of soluble fiber per day may reduce LDL cholesterol by 5.5–11 mg per deciliter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another impressive benefit of chia seeds is their rich concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Chia seeds are rich in plant-based &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, which positively support heart health,” says Sheth. Research suggests that ALA can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may also help increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, though the findings weren’t significant.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are simple to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate into a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; and are relatively inexpensive—especially if you buy them in bulk. Akerman notes that while the price varies by brand, chia seeds are generally cost-effective as you’ll likely only use a tablespoon or two at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds can be added to virtually any dish, from creamy overnight oats to dinner-sized salads. “Add chia seeds to a smoothie, mix into a yogurt, soak overnight in soy milk (also good for lowering cholesterol) to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;make a chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; or use [them] in granola. Powder form can be used in baked goods, bread or cracker doughs, oatmeal or smoothies,” says Del Coro. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight chia seed pudding is Sheth’s favorite recipe for a delicious, heart-healthy breakfast or snack. She varies up the milk (almond, soy) and adds fresh fruit (berries, mango, stone fruit) and a small handful of chopped nuts (pistachios, walnuts, almonds). You can also sprinkle chia seeds over a slice of avocado toast, add them to a classic PB&amp;amp;J or use them to make a DIY &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-protein-powder-11713647" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure to add chia seeds gradually into your diet and drink plenty of water to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestive side effects&lt;/a&gt;, like bloating or gas. Sheth notes that this is particularly important if you’re not used to eating a high-fiber diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unopened, chia seeds can last up to 5 years when stored in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cabinet. Once opened, Akerman recommends storing chia seeds in an airtight container in the fridge to extend their shelf life and prevent them from going rancid. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain risk factors for high cholesterol, like your genetics, age and family history, are outside of your control. However, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help lower your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health. Here are three strategies to try:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat more plants  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sheth recommends filling your plate with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7943524/plant-based-low-cholesterol-dinner-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; and heart-healthy fats, like olive oil, to help lower cholesterol. Whole, minimally processed plant-based foods, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes, are packed with beneficial nutrients for heart health and cholesterol levels. In addition to providing fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals, they’re also typically low in saturated fat. Compared to omnivorous diets, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vegan and vegetarian diets&lt;/a&gt; have been associated with lower total and LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Move your body  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Akerman highlights the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;importance of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. Regular exercise is shown to increase HDL and lower LDL levels. To help prevent or reduce high cholesterol, the American Heart Association recommends engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense cardiovascular exercise per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swimming, cycling, running and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; are all classic examples of aerobic exercise. Dancing, hiking, vigorous yard work and gardening also count. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Do not smoke  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smoking and vaping can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Smoking can also increase the risk of heart disease by increasing triglyceride levels and other health conditions associated with high cholesterol, like diabetes and high blood pressure. If you currently smoke, reach out to a healthcare professional for guidance and resources on how to quit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain soluble fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, all of which can help improve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support overall heart health. Besides being incredibly nutritious, these tiny but mighty seeds are also easy to use, versatile and relatively inexpensive, making them an excellent addition to your pantry (or fridge). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no one food&lt;/a&gt; can magically improve your cholesterol levels. Eating an overall healthy diet that’s rich in minimally processed plant-based foods, moving your body daily and not smoking are also key. Cholesterol-lowering medications may also be necessary for some folks. Regardless of where you start, identify at least one or two changes you can make today to start moving towards a more heart-healthy lifestyle.

Controlling blood sugar levels can help benefit the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes and obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes and obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/experts-reveal-5-step-approach-healthier-gut-stronger-immunity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Experts Reveal 5-Step Approach To A Healthier Gut And Stronger Immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts Reveal 5-Step Approach To A Healthier Gut And Stronger Immunity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research published in the journal Nutrients found that patients who followed the meal sequencing method — eating vegetables before refined carbohydrates — showed a significant improvement in glycemic control and blood sugar after a five-year period, while the group that did not follow the approach did not show improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What causes the sugar spikes is eating too many carbs," Sandra J. Arevalo, a New York-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating them alone makes it even worse," she cautioned. "When eating them together with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;, we are cushioning their effect by slowing their absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that eating protein before refined carbs promotes the secretion of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the gut, which delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat other foods first — mainly fiber-rich foods — and then you &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink water&lt;/a&gt;, the fiber from the foods helps you feel satisfied, thus decreasing your appetite," Arevalo told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And let’s not forget that fiber also helps to reduce the absorption of sugar in the blood, helping to cushion your sugar levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex carbohydrates — such as most vegetables, beans and legumes — are rich in fiber and slow to digest, which causes a gradual rise in blood sugar levels, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates — such as sugar, white rice and white flour — have higher glycemic levels, which are easier to break down and contribute to faster blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrition experts pointed out, eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;during digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower during digestion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assist with healthier food choices and to monitor blood sugar levels after a meal, experts recommend using a food rating system called the glycemic index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rating scale determines how quickly certain foods can cause blood sugars to rise and fall, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, Susie laid out the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with eating non-starchy vegetables first, as the fiber slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat protein and healthy fats.
