                &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-eats-high-protein-diet-without-ultra-processed-foods-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, a registered nutritionist based in the UK, found out his cholesterol levels were "really high" in June, he decided to manage them through diet, focusing particularly on increasing his fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, when he tested again, his &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chickpea-recipes-to-lower-cholesterol-science-backed-advice-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; had improved, and he'd discovered four tricks that make eating more fiber easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a fatty substance the body needs for many bodily processes, but if a person has too much LDL or "bad" cholesterol, it can form sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce cholesterol levels, the American Heart Association recommends exercising at least 150 minutes a week, quitting smoking and vaping, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a heart-healthy diet that's low in saturated fats and high in fiber. If these measures don't help, then statins, a medication that lowers LDL cholesterol, will likely be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson, the author of "Unprocess Your Life" and "The Low Appetite Cookbook," already worked out for around an hour each morning, and ate &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;minimal ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and saturated fats. So he zeroed in on fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;p&gt;Eating at least 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber a day can help lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, according to the National Lipid Association. Quinoa, oats, avocado, sweet potatoes, carrots, and chia or flax seeds are good examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Hobson's tips for seamlessly adding more fiber to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1a4aa01f-6ea0-4848-8371-896ad3e1f530" data-toc-id="1a4aa01f-6ea0-4848-8371-896ad3e1f530"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson is a big advocate of breakfast because it lends itself to high-fiber foods such as oats, nuts, and seeds. "It's really easy to get plenty of fiber in at that time of day," he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has two go-to breakfasts that he eats on repeat. The first is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quick-easy-high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-every-morning-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Greek yogurt bowl&lt;/a&gt; with berries, oats, and chia seeds. The second is overnight oats, which he makes with milk, protein powder, berries, honey, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="16694455-4bae-4acc-a454-c4db8f5516a8" data-toc-id="16694455-4bae-4acc-a454-c4db8f5516a8"&gt;Fiber cupboard&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hobson created a "fiber cupboard" in his kitchen that's packed with fibrous foods. He challenges himself to include something from the cupboard in every meal. "Then at least you know that you are making the effort to do it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stocks up on &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/3-ways-add-beans-meals-protein-fiber-private-chef-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lentils, beans, pulses&lt;/a&gt;, wholegrain pasta, brown rice, as well as snacks like fruit and nut bars, rye crackers that he likes to pair with some cottage cheese, and seaweed thins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm always rooting around for stuff, and I just think having it all in one place is so much easier," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8e599fc6-b8d1-4acf-8b7c-eeb1438c25f3" data-toc-id="8e599fc6-b8d1-4acf-8b7c-eeb1438c25f3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add pulses and legumes to your meal and put the rest into a Tupperware in the fridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to add fiber to a meal is to pour half a can of beans or pulses into it, Hobson said. Just one &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recipes-black-beans-to-reduce-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cup of black beans&lt;/a&gt;, for example, contains 15 grams of fiber. "You can add them to anything," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix some into a soup, sauce, or curry, or simply sprinkle a couple of tablespoons on top of a salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not using the whole can, decant the rest into a Tupperware and place it in the fridge, Hobson said. That way, they'll stay fresher for longer and be easily accessible. "Then you don't have to worry about, 'I'm going to waste the rest of the tin,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="140201b5-2f70-454c-af06-f674067ade72" data-toc-id="140201b5-2f70-454c-af06-f674067ade72"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the food you want to eat visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson recommends keeping the foods you want to eat in a visible spot. That way, you're more likely to reach for them. "Nuts and seeds, always keep them on the side so they're there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that the foods you keep on your countertop could impact your body weight, a factor that can influence cholesterol levels. In a 2015 study published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1090198115610571" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Sage Journals&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Cornell University analyzed the visible foods on 210 countertops in New York and measured their owners' BMIs. They found that those who had just fresh fruit visible weighed an average of 20 pounds less than those who had unhealthier snacks like candy, soda, and cereals on show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's your basic See-Food Diet — you eat what you see," Brian Wansink, the study's lead author, said of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you're not ready to make changes to your kitchen layout, Hobson said to stick to one basic principle: "Make sure that you've got a bit of fiber on your plate every day with every meal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

She explained their benefits and listed the key sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why should you eat fermented foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the dietician, fermented foods are packed with probiotics. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;They support beneficial gut bacteria and help maintain a healthy balance in the digestive system, while also facilitating key gut functions such as digestion and nutrient absorption.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;She also reminded that nearly 70 per cent of the immune system is linked to the gut, making it a critical line of defence against infections and inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But beyond digestive and immune health, gut microbes also influence brain activity, mood and emotional regulation through the gut-brain axis. Tehseen shared that when gut health is well-balanced, which fermented foods help achieve, brain functions such as mood, stress regulation, and sleep also improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fermented food sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/02/original/bowl-with-yogurt-berries-high-angle_1746163634504.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Add fermented foods like unsweetened yoghurt to diet.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding fermented food to your diet is actually easy. The dietician disclosed that it does not have to be complicated. She shared, “Starting with small portions of unsweetened yoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut, fermented vegetables, or traditional foods like curd and buttermilk can be effective.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, she revealed that fermented foods can be consumed by adding them to meals and smoothies. When consumed regularly, they help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, while also supporting digestion and immunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This year will be about JOMO instead of FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So many of us can relate to FOMO - the Fear Of Missing Out - but what if we stop trying to keep across everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Why don't we experience JOMO - the Joy Of Missing Out?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;FOMO was first recognised by the Oxford Dictionary back in 2004, where we compare our lives to others, and put pressure on ourselves to keep up in a world that's often been created by our sparkling, shiny socials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now, more than 20 years later, a counter movement is growing to reduce the anxiety that often comes with worrying about what others are doing and trying not to spread ourselves too thinly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's not just as simple as saying no to things, Mr Phillips says, it's about learning to be more comfortable in ourselves and not needing external validation for how we choose to live our lives - whether that's the frequency of our workouts or how often we socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's about understanding what's right for you, and not feeling guilt or shame for prioritising yourself," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Brain boosting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Boosting, that's the key word here," Rachel Chatterton, a product director at Holland Barrett explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Our customers are super interested in anything that gives them a boost - and this year will be about boosting their brain power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nootropics, supplements which purportedly enhance cognition which are sometimes referred to as "smart drugs", have been around for decades, but it's only in the past few years that their appeal has really taken off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These should not be confused with regulated pharmaceutical drugs which can help with conditions like ADHD, narcolepsy and Alzheimer's disease and should only be taken with a diagnosed medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By 2030, the likes of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10675414/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;lion's mane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724001684" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; L-theanine&lt;/a&gt; could be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pharmiweb.com/press-release/2024-03-25/nootropics-market-poised-for-remarkable-growth-to-surpass-usd-137-billion-by-2032-enabling-112#:~:text=Nootropics%20Market%20Poised%20For%20Remarkable%2Cmemory%2C%20creativity%2C%20and%20motivation." class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;commanding an $11bn (£8bn) size slice&lt;/a&gt; of the wellbeing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There may only be a number of small studies that suggest these supplements can improve cognition, enhance memory and reduce stress but Ms Chatterton says the market, especially among Gen Z, is booming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a71e/live/60faab50-e800-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Medicinal mushroom powders.

A touch of maple syrup adds sweetness to balance the tart lemon.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This easy, meal-prep-friendly recipe takes all the flavors of a caramel apple and imparts them into breakfast.

Crushed honey-roasted peanuts mimic the coating of a caramel apple, but any salty-sweet nut would be delicious.

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9029013/"&gt;CDC researchers found an unexpected pattern&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific &lt;em&gt;Bacillus &lt;/em&gt;species was identified, &lt;em&gt;B. tropicus &lt;/em&gt;was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speculating risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing &lt;em&gt;Bacillus &lt;/em&gt;in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a deep, aching hole in my heart. Even though our home is filled with people, it’s too quiet without you," began the grieving mother in a new post shared to Instagram on Jan. 2.

"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Continued Maggie: "Oh, the pain is indescribable. And yet, you have shown us in multiple ways that you are with us.

"For those two weeks we were fighting long and hard, we were consulting legal, health, ethical teams even outside the hospital. Just to make sure we weren't leaving any stone unturned.

                &lt;p&gt;After studying stem cell aging for decades, Dr. Thomas Rando learned that some of the best &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-longevity-exercise-diet-aging-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity advice&lt;/a&gt; is timeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I often make the joke that the billions of dollars that have been spent on studying healthy aging could come down to the two things your mother told you," Rando, the president of the American Federation for Aging Research and director of the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, told Business Insider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eat a good diet and get plenty of exercise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rando dedicated his career to studying how tissues repair themselves — and why they eventually lose the ability to do it well. What he learned is that many of the drugs tested in animals that are meant to extend lifespan work as effectively as a balanced &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-longevity-researcher-follows-for-healthy-aging-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diet and exercise do&lt;/a&gt;. One example was a 2022 study that found mice that were put on fasting diets were as resilient to stress as those injected with ketone bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that many drugs and interventions are "just in a way supplementing the challenges that humans face in dieting and exercising."&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his own life, he said his research hasn't inspired too many drastic lifestyle changes as much as reinforcing healthy habits, like cutting ultra-processed foods after college or continuing to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-year-unhealthy-moderate-drinking-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;drink in moderation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of his peers in the field, he &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/supplements" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;doesn't take any supplements&lt;/a&gt;; he's more persuaded that lifestyle habits such as eating whole foods and taking care of his body are the keys to longevity. "From my own studies, if you are eating well, sleeping well, and exercising, it's unlikely that supplements are going to make a difference," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rando shared the three longevity habits he's stuck to for years, from avid running to lots of socializing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5d6796db-c8f1-4002-9325-7acd345896b9" data-toc-id="5d6796db-c8f1-4002-9325-7acd345896b9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He started running in his 30s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By his 30s, Rando realized his work schedule made it hard to exercise: organizing basketball or squash games just took too much time. So, he started running solo a few miles a day, a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a colleague convinced him to run a 5K, he fell in love with racing. He worked his way up to a 10K, half-marathon, and eventually, a marathon. He's been a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-ran-my-first-marathon-advice-mistakes-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;marathon runner&lt;/a&gt; for the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not that people should do marathons, but I really believe in the rejuvenating powers of exercise," Rando said. While he's still researching all the ways that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-longevity-scientist-shared-his-weekly-workout-routine-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;working out benefits longevity&lt;/a&gt;, he said there's lots of evidence to support that regular exercise lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rando, who's currently dealing with an Achilles tendon injury, said he's running a little less often and focusing a little more on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/exercise-for-healthy-aging-longevity-strength-training-personal-trainer-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, which is also important for healthy aging as muscle mass declines over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the anti-aging benefits, he said he loves how running makes him feel. "I think clearly, I think I solve problems when I run," he said. "So that was an added icing on the cake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7d009965-fefe-45cd-98cb-fe50527e38cf" data-toc-id="7d009965-fefe-45cd-98cb-fe50527e38cf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He fasts one day a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rando generally follows the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, considered the healthiest diet in the world. He eats lean protein, fruits, and vegetables while cutting back on red meat, carbohydrates, and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I love a steak dinner, and I'll splurge on that," Rando said. "But my typical dinners are either purely vegetarian or with some light meat or some fish."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, he's practiced a form of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-benefits-and-risks-for-longevity-weight-loss-cancer-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; where he doesn't eat breakfast. He usually has a light lunch of edamame and hard-boiled eggs, and eats his biggest meal at dinner. Some studies find that intermittent fasting can help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-burn-fat-control-blood-sugar-study-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;control blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and burn fat, while others show &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-linked-higher-risk-of-early-death-controversial-study-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mixed evidence&lt;/a&gt; that intermittent fasting has sustained benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Rando also &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-tried-intermittent-fasting-like-elon-musk-for-a-month-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fasts for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; once a week, another form of time-restricted eating. Because dinner is his biggest meal, he usually starts fasting until dinner the next day, rather than starting the fast in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he isn't super strict about fasting. "My lifestyle is just not conducive to fasting multiple days in a row, partly because of the exercise, partly because I'm going to dinners and lunches with people," he said. "But I do believe in fasting as a means toward healthy aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because intermittent fasting is still being studied, including any potential &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-linked-higher-risk-of-early-death-controversial-study-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;long-term risks&lt;/a&gt;, Rando considers it "a leap of faith."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe from the science that this will have a long-term benefit," he said. But it's not because he feels the same immediate effects as he does from exercising. "I just feel hungry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="79f543fd-3c7e-4043-b25b-91b16aa4e42c" data-toc-id="79f543fd-3c7e-4043-b25b-91b16aa4e42c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socializing at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As president of AFAR, Rando naturally interacts with a lot of people. "Through my work, I lead a very social life," he said, including collaborating with other researchers, sitting on various committees, and attending events. He said he also makes it a point to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retirement-isolation-friends-rejection-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;socialize outside work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he said it's harder to quantify the impact of social ties on longevity, there's a lot of compelling anecdotal evidence in favor of it. Some of it comes from Rando's own research: &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-habits-from-96-year-old-doctor-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Dr. Ira Eliasoph&lt;/a&gt;, a 96-year-old AFAR study participant, said strong relationships helped him live a long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe in the evidence that social interactions are really important as people get older," Rando said.&lt;/p&gt;

Only one of the infections involved a fully vaccinated person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly infectious and sometimes deadly virus, was declared eliminated in the US more than 25 years ago. But the past year has presented increasing challenges to maintaining that status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diseases are generally declared eliminated when there is no local transmission in a given region, although cases can still be “imported” from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US’s elimination status is largely credited to the success of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1963, the first measles vaccine was licensed in the US, and by 1971, the combination MMR vaccine was unveiled to protect against the three illnesses at once. Two shots are typically recommended to achieve full vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, in 1978, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set 1982 as a deadline to achieve the elimination of measles in the country. It missed that target by nearly 18 years, reaching elimination status in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccine hesitancy has been blamed for allowing the virus to spread in the US, both then and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the death rate for measles is relatively low, its infection rate is high. The CDC estimates that, if one person has the virus, they could infect nine out of every 10 people around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization says that, for every 1,000 reported cases, there are about two to three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are especially vulnerable. Complications can include high fever, hearing or vision loss and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, medical professionals recommend children be vaccinated early in their lives, receiving their first dose before 15 months of age and their second by age six. The vaccine is widely accepted as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccine scepticism has been on the rise in the US, with critics blaming, in part, policies implemented under the administration of President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CDC data, the MMR vaccination rate in the US was 95.2 percent among kindergarteners during the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number, however, tumbled to 92.7 percent by the 2023-2024 school year, representing a difference of 280,000 kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 represented a high-water mark in the resurgence of the measles virus. The CDC reported 2,065 cases of measles last year, the most since 1991 — and more than seven times the rate of 2024, when only 285 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest outbreaks took place in Texas, where three people died from the virus, with the first reported last February. Prior to that incident, no death had been reported from measles in the US &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/27/us-reports-first-measles-death-since-2015"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of that death, Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak"&gt;encouraged&lt;/a&gt; vaccination, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; on social media, “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy, who is not a medical professional, has since expressed views that appeared to discourage the vaccine’s use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late April, for instance, he told NewsNation, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts, however, have denounced that claim as false. While the rubella part of the vaccine was developed using a cell culture that came from an elective abortion in the 1960s, no fetal tissue has been used since, nor is there any fetal issue in the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has also spread unfounded claims that purport to link vaccination to autism, despite widespread outcry from the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Carolina, the current measles outbreak is concentrated in the northwest. The South Carolina Department of Public Health says that the reported infections are largely in children under the age of 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Democratic candidate running in the state’s 2026 midterm elections, paediatrician Annie Andrews, has made combating the outbreak a central part of her campaign.

But no one until now has claimed that a pint could save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Then came Chris Buck, a virologist at the National Cancer Institute, who is also an enthusiastic home brewer. Dr Buck believes he has created the world’s first beer vaccine. He brewed the first batch last summer using a yeast modified to contain a vaccine protein. It was a Lithuanian-style farmhouse ale that was awfully drinkable, and also appeared to immunise him against a virus linked to certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://link.thetimes.co.uk/join/74t/signup-us?source=WebsiteArticle" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up for The Times’s weekly US newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These tests suggested he had developed antibodies against two types of BK polyomavirus thought to cause certain types of bladder cancer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In Buck’s view, this only the start of what a beer could do. “This one vaccine is just proving the principle,” he said. “Next on the agenda is Covid and flu and probably herpes viruses and adenovirus [associated with mild colds and flu] … Anything that is a common-cold virus is in our crosshairs now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.4"&gt;&lt;div id="4b8161cc-ef17-499e-a054-980d0b7b55d2"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The beer is a Lithuanian-style farmhouse ale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nor does a vaccine have to be delivered in a beer. Buck, 55, thinks the modified yeast could be used to make yoghurt, or crisps, that could confer a similar immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The scientist does not usually whip up experiments in his kitchen, and some of his peers are now alarmed that his homebrew adventures could damage public trust in vaccines. They also warn that one beer drinker conducting tests on himself does not establish the efficacy of a supposed treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I disagree,” said Buck, who has been a scientist at the National Institutes of Health since 2001. “I think if a food vaccine works in one person that tells you something very important, which is that it can work in &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; one person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Vaccines are often made inside insect cells, but they can also be created in yeast cells: there is then a tricky “purification” process, stripping everything else away to leave a protein particle for injection. “It eventually just occurred to me, like maybe we don’t have to purify,” he said. Perhaps the yeast could simply be eaten, or drunk in a foaming pint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The conventional wisdom is that this does not work because vaccine proteins are broken down by stomach acid, he said. This proved true when Buck and his colleagues fed mice with ground-up yeast containing vaccine proteins, supplied by a Lithuanian scientist named Alma Gedvilaite. But when they tried whole, live yeast containing the virus particles, the mice developed “robust antibody responses”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I literally felt weak at the knees,” Buck said. “I could see that this meant that the vaccine could be a food. And if it can be a food, it means you can regulate it like a food and it’s easy to distribute and many people will be happier about it than a shot. All of these implications were there at that first experiment a year and a half ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Buck initially started working on potential vaccines for HIV, HPV and polyomaviruses. “Their name is ancient Greek for ‘many tumours’,” he said of the latter. “It causes cancer in mice for sure.” They can also cause serious problems for transplant patients taking immunosuppresant drugs. Buck’s laboratory at the National Cancer Institute is working with the biotech company Biological E on a vaccine for polyomaviruses that would be administered by injection, but they are still some distance from clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/measles-30-year-high-rfkj-cdc-9mqtjjxw0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;US measles cases surpass 2,000 for first time in 30 years&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A food-based, or beer-based vaccine, available at once, could potentially save lives, he said. “Anyone who is waiting for a transplant would like this vaccine,” he said. “If I were waiting for a transplant I would get it immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Besides being suspected of causing cancer, the polyomavirus can cause a painful bladder condition in patients who receive bone-marrow transplants. Buck recalls visiting a paediatric hospital that had installed sound-proofing in its lavatories to dampen the sounds of children with the condition screaming in the middle of the night. It may also cause a painful bladder condition in older women, he said. Patients with it “shed a lot of polyomavirus in their urine”, he said. “That’s not causality … but [if] you have painful bladder syndrome, you brew beer, you drink beer, and if the pain goes away, then you say ‘Yahtzee’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He said he tried to put the beer idea before an institutional review board at the National Institutes of Health. “A senior official in the chain bounced away the application before it could be considered,” he said. “The friction was that the institution is not accustomed to thinking about food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He thinks they were trying to assess it the way they would a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Buck didn’t have much patience for that red tape. “Instead of trying to convince them what the law was, I basically demonstrated what the law was by doing it in my kitchen,” he said. He got his younger brother Andrew to form a company, and sell batches of the beer to two close friends. “We just need a company with a record of sales,” said Buck, who lives in Bethesda, Maryland. “If something is already in the food supply and doesn’t appear to be causing problems, then the manufacturer can just say, look, it’s generally recognised as safe because it’s already there and we don’t know of any problems.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Over the summer, after drinking his own beer but before tests showed he had developed antibodies, Buck spoke at a virology conference in southern Italy. Michael Imperiale, a virologist and emeritus professor at the University of Michigan Medical School, watched his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I said: ‘What are you going to do if someone has a bad reaction to this?’” Imperiale said. He felt that one man and his brother drinking a beer vaccine was not enough to show that something was safe. He said that trials on, say, a thousand people with diverse genetics would be required. But his main concern was that with Robert F Kennedy Jr, a famous vaccine sceptic who as US health secretary has diminished trust in vaccines, it could make matters worse to have a government scientist brewing them in his kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The US government itself is trying to actively get people to be against vaccines, right?” Imperiale said. “We, the scientific community, really have to keep that in mind … Is what we’re doing going to enhance the public trust or is it going to make it worse?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.24"&gt;&lt;div id="a6cd19d8-50d5-4944-beca-8f518387f398"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The beer becomes fluorescent under blue light&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Several other scientists have told Science News, which first reported on Buck’s vaccine beer, that they have similar concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But Buck says his own mother is an antivaxer. “She lives in eastern Washington state, which is a very rural environment. All of her church friends are antivaxers,” he said. “I used to agree with the view that the solution to distrust of vaccines was to raise our safety standards and have more and more stringent qualifications for vaccines that hit the market. And with hindsight, I think it backfired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He thinks scientists’ efforts to show that they take elaborate care with a vaccine — Buck refers to it as “security theatre” — only made people think: “Wow, that thing must be really dangerous.” But producing a vaccine that people can make in their own kitchen proves a vaccine “is just some ordinary thing that is not that dangerous”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On December 17, Buck and his brother published a non-peer-reviewed paper, &lt;i&gt;Vaccine Beer: A Personal Healthcare Report&lt;/i&gt;, which contained recipes for vaccine beer. In the coming months, he hopes to persuade a company to manufacture the modified yeast and to find a brewer willing to make a line of what he calls VAC-beer (Vaccine Antigen Containing) for sale in North America. (He doubts it could be sold in Britain or Europe, given the regulations on genetically modified foodstuffs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I don’t know what Robert Kennedy is going to make of this,” he said. “This is my boss’s boss’s boss and I do not know whether he will think: ‘Oh, it looks like health food, I love it!’ Or: ‘Oh, it looks like a vaccine, I hate it.’ I have no idea how that’s going to come out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/vaccine-sceptic-conspiracist-liar-its-rfk-jr-ts9pkvpv7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vaccine sceptic, conspiracist, ‘liar’: it’s Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What about his mother?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Mom seems entirely amenable to beer vaccine,” he said. “But I wouldn’t call it an informative datapoint because my love for food and home fermentation projects was inherited directly from her.

Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research reveals","elementId":"180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/18/artificial-intelligence-uk-emotional-support-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/18/warning-ai-chatbots-inaccurate-financial-advice-tips-chatgpt-copilot-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;gave inaccurate financial advice&lt;/a&gt;, while similar concerns have been raised about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5ggew08eyo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summaries of news stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Typing “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:17,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQXBwR0FUdTRWaVBla050WU9xQW9YMDlERXdOc2hnZ0pLS2FBbjhmMmZaZ1ZKSTZNTUdMekc1ZmZWcExJaGRTVFctYm94dHlJZVNOOWJhOVdFcVdrVWx0RjZuSzhmeEdxbVRsRElfNDdMUERxVHNic293NVMyT1N2aDlRT09KMnY0NHkwODZlUzYwNjVtVDFtdlkyZ2JxWS1KMWwwRU1nTXRTNGk4a3dv</guid></item><item><title>专家遵循6条长寿规则，在2026年实现更健康的衰老-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/health/6-longevity-rules-experts-follow-healthier-aging-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!

                &lt;p&gt;The influenza season is in full swing, and it’s already proving to be deadly for some of the most vulnerable Americans around: children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several states have reported their first pediatric flu deaths this week. Cases and hospitalizations are rising across the country as well, while some areas are experiencing record-level surges of illness. The season is being driven by the emergence of an unexpected strain of the H3N2 flu, named subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tragic deaths&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to the holidays, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;most current flu data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is nearly two weeks old. Yet it’s still evident that this season is gearing up to be a nasty one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of December 20, flu activity was high or very high in 32 regions of the U.S. and moderate in eight other jurisdictions. The cumulative flu hospitalization rate in week 51 was also the third highest it’s been at this point in the past 15 years (the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons were the other two).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things have been even worse for some states. Last week, for example, New York health officials &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-26_flu_cases.htm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; experiencing the largest weekly surge in flu cases ever recorded in modern history—71,123 positive flu cases during the week of December 20.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At least eight pediatric flu deaths this winter have also been recorded by the CDC so far, though local health officials and members of the public have documented more since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On December 30, for instance, the Kentucky Department for Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/News/Documents/Kentucky%20Reports%201st%20Pediatric%20Influenza%20Death%20This%20Respiratory%20Virus%20Season.pdf"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its first pediatric flu death of the 2025-26 season: a child from Kenton County who did not receive a flu vaccination. The next day, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/first-pediatric-flu-death-123125"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its first pediatric flu death, which involved a teenager from Greene County. And on Thursday, Paul Kim, a popular social media influencer and Minnesota resident, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/catholic-influencers-5-year-old-son-dies-contracting-flu-rcna251834"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that his five-year-old son died after contracting a severe bout of flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This death is tragic and our hearts go out to the family,” said Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health, in a &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/first-pediatric-flu-death-123125"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It also reminds us that influenza, though common, is a serious health threat, and we urge parents to protect their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A record bad winter?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even during a typical winter, the seasonal flu will sicken millions of Americans, hospitalize hundreds of thousands, and kill tens of thousands. But it’s certainly possible that we could be in for two straight bad seasons in a row. Last winter, at least 280 children in the U.S. died of the flu, the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/more-kids-are-dying-from-seasonal-flu-than-ever-2000668078"&gt;highest death toll&lt;/a&gt; in children for a non-pandemic flu seen in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This season is being fueled by the emergence of subclade K, an H3N2 variant noticeably different on a genetic level from the flu strains scientists predicted would be circulating this season. Since its arrival toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, K has quickly taken over as the leading cause of flu cases worldwide, including in the U.S. Though the variant doesn’t appear to cause &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586"&gt;more severe infections&lt;/a&gt; on average than other H3N2 strains, it has caused strong, early, or prolonged waves of illness in various parts of the world, including the &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/12/02/japan/science-health/flu-season/"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701333/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to subclade K, it’s still worth getting your shot if you haven’t already. Data from the UK has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D." target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that vaccination this season is still effective at preventing serious flu complications, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

"This may be challenging as parents may have yet had the time to forge a strong bond with their child's pediatrician, but the study highlights the importance of pediatric providers having vaccination discussions and building trust as early as possible with parents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Results from the study showed that those who received their 2-month vaccines on time were seven times more likely to get the MMR vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team found that the percentage of children who received the MMR vaccine on time changed over the study period, increasing from 75.6% in 2018 to 79.9% in 2021, and then falling to 76.9% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This decrease between 2021 and 2024 was associated with an increase in the percentage of children who did not receive the MMR vaccine by age 2, increasing from 5.3% in 2020 to 7.7% in 2024, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Children who were more likely to be unvaccinated for the MMR shot by age 2 were boys, and white and non-Hispanic or Latino, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Rural residence slightly increased the risk of no MMR vaccination, even among children receiving routine care, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study only included children with regular access to care, so real-world vaccination delays may be worse in the broader U.S. population, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors added that these results point to increased vaccine hesitancy or unmeasured access challenges, highlighting the importance of timely intervention so children are less likely to delay or miss vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;In this March 1, 2025, file photo, a child is held by his mother while he receives an MMR vaccine at a vaccine clinic put on by the Lubbock Public Health Department in Lubbock, Texas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images, FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who was not involved in the study, said the findings have major public health implications because there are questions about whether the U.S. will retain its measles elimination status and increasing vaccination is "the way out of this problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you want to live in a society where measles is a problem of the past, where we don't have to think about it, where schools don't have to come up with contingency plans, where we don't have children unnecessarily dying from measles, then that's a reason to get the vaccine," he told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Adalja added that vaccination doesn't just protect the individual against infection, but it also has a community benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The higher the vaccination level is in a given community, the more resilient that community will be to those infectious diseases," he said. "And if you're someone that's immunocompromised, you may want to live in to live in an area that has high vaccination rates because you are at higher risk, and if you're in a high vaccination area, there's going to be a lowering of that risk because of the community level immunity that exists in that area.

But if losing belly fat is one of your resolutions and you think that &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; is the key, then it’s time to think again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The single best thing we can do for ourselves is exercising. It works on almost all diseases we can measure – but not for weight loss,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/research-groups/clemmensen-group/?pure=en/persons/293530"&gt;Professor Christoffer Clemmensen&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Basic Metabolic Research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, studies have repeatedly shown the “eat less; move more” mantra parroted to those looking to lose &lt;a href="/topic/body-fat"&gt;body fat&lt;/a&gt; is ineffective. And nor is willpower the vital key that many people believe it to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Weight loss is not a matter of willpower,” adds his colleague, PhD fellow Valdemar Brimnes Ingemann Johansen. “It’s critical to acknowledge the powerful biological mechanisms that interact with your environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic predisposition is a big determinant of our body size and how we look – and this powerful biology that underlies our body size is often beyond an individual’s control.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair are responsible for a recent literature review, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/s0092-8674(25)00677-4"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; journal, which dives deep into this topic. Here, they reveal more about the lesser-known mechanisms behind weight loss that might just help you achieve your goals this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with a calorie deficit &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calorie is a unit of energy – more specifically, one kilocalorie is the estimated amount of energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1C. Since the 19th century, this has been the most common unit of measurement used for listing energy in food and drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calorie deficit is the common denominator behind weight loss, and so it is widely prescribed to people looking to lose body fat, presenting the idea that if you expend more calories than you consume, you will create a negative energy balance and lose weight. This fact is not disputed by our experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone can lose weight if you put them in a restrictive environment,” says Professor Clemmensen. “It’s the laws of thermodynamics and it will work on everyone; if you have a negative energy balance, you will lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you can’t tell people to stay in a negative energy balance in the free world, because you have these strong biological forces that are telling people to eat. Unless you can restrict your meal size, or you have someone to put a lock on your cabinets, it’s just impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Calorie deficit comments disregard the power of biology underlying weight control. It’s like telling people who are stressed to relax, or telling people who have psychological illnesses to just get their act together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/nutrionist-healthy-longevity-diet-b2862364.html"&gt;What foods nutrition experts really eat to stop chronic illness in old age (and always avoid)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hjimhY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/22/46/iStock-2196789730.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/22/46/iStock-2196789730.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/09/22/46/iStock-2196789730.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A calorie deficit will cause you to lose weight, but studies suggest the results do not last long-term" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-317570"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A calorie deficit will cause you to lose weight, but studies suggest the results do not last long-term&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The new science behind weight loss &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is classified as a chronic, relapsing disease by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, with the institution reporting: “In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why would our bodies contain “strong biological forces” to promote or protect a condition linked to ill &lt;a href="/topic/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;? The answer, according to Johansen, lies with our predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stored fat would have helped our human ancestors stave off starvation when food was scarce, so the body “remembers” it and tries to replenish these stores when food becomes available, he says. As part of this, the body treats weight loss like a threat, fighting it by releasing a flood of hunger hormones and heightening food cravings while reducing our energy expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, this might have been helpful; in the 21st century, where energy-dense foods are more accessible than ever and movement is optional, these impulses can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Clemmensen led a 2025 literature review on this topic, which found evidence to support the presence of what he describes as an “obesity memory”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This idea about memory of obesity is a little bit elusive," he says. “We don’t know where that memory is stored, but you can see it’s there. If you look at studies where people have undergone extreme weight loss, most of them will find their way back quite accurately to their original weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There seems to be a very specific memory, for want of a better term, of what your weight was. That’s what we’re working on in our lab to try to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of this memory will, as with most things in the human body, vary from person to person depending on factors such as genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How much people are able to sustain lost body fat and how they will respond to different types of interventions – both behavioural and pharmacological, like weight loss drugs – will depend on the person,” Johansen explains. “We see quite some variability among people when we look at big clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting, and very valuable, if we could understand more about what makes one person regain all their lost bodyweight in just a couple of months, while another person is able to sustain their weight loss for years. This is probably, if I am allowed to speculate, down to the interaction between the environment that person is living in and their genetic make-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/running-marathon-hyrox-endurance-sport-b2847344.html"&gt;Is the rise of endurance sports a harmless health kick – or dangerous addiction to adventure?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 YIVyy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/19/10/newFile-4.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/19/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/07/19/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Someone’s ability to achieve and sustain weight loss, as well as their response to various interventions such as weight loss drugs and diets, will depend on individual factors such as genetics" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-317571"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Someone’s ability to achieve and sustain weight loss, as well as their response to various interventions such as weight loss drugs and diets, will depend on individual factors such as genetics&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What actually works for weight loss? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has tried to lose weight will be aware of a disconnect between &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; to reduce body fat and &lt;em&gt;succeeding &lt;/em&gt;in doing so. Professor Clemmensen’s idea of “obesity memory” provides a possible explanation for this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if “eat less; move more” does not work as an approach, what does? This is a tricky question to answer, Professor Clemmensen says, as research into the topic is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do we actually have enough knowledge to guide people on how to live, in terms of losing weight? I don’t think so. I think that’s part of the hard truth we, as researchers, sometimes have to deliver,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; and exercise are unimportant – wider health-promoting behaviours, regardless of their impact on body weight, should always be encouraged. Eating a nourishing diet rich in a large variety of vegetables combined with protein and some kind of fish is more likely to have a favourable impact on the body – compositionally and hormonally – than less nutrient-dense alternatives like junk food, helping you feel and function better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Macronutrient composition will have different effects on the various hormonal systems in the body,” Professor Clemmensen explains. “If you get all your calories from liquid sugar versus from chicken breast, it will have very different impacts on the hormonal environment in the body, and subsequent feelings of hunger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same applies for exercise. Moving more will have a transformative effect on health markers such as blood pressure and your risk of chronic diseases, but Professor Clemmensen says, “There is very little evidence to suggest it can override that memory of prior bodyweight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no single intervention that provides an all-encompassing solution, and people’s varied genetic make-ups render blanket prescriptions impossible. But a combination of manageable interventions appears to be the most productive course of action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing sustainable habits such as sufficient sleep, a nutritious diet and regular exercise will form part of the puzzle. These are things you can implement to improve overall health – and possibly assist in appetite regulation, energy balance and weight management too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Professor Clemmensen and Johansen suggest that environmental and societal changes, long-term planning and pharmacological interventions are also necessary in reversing wider obesity rates in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/negative-health-effects-of-sitting-down-b2842653.html"&gt;From back pain to heart health – Experts reveal how to counter the negative effects of too much sitting down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cDKnxE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/21/15/23/iStock-2223395151.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/21/15/23/iStock-2223395151.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/21/15/23/iStock-2223395151.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Sufficient sleep quantity and quality can help with appetite regulation" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-317572"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Sufficient sleep quantity and quality can help with appetite regulation&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt;

One of them lives just down my block.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ednajane Truax, who is known to friends and neighbors as “E.J.,” can often be found on her hands and knees in the dirt, working in the garden at the Sherwood Recreation Center in Northeast Washington. She also has an impressive garden of her own and helps out with other neighbors’ gardens. She works out several times a week, sometimes while wearing a shirt that says, “You don’t stop lifting when you get old — you get old when you stop lifting.” She can bench press 55 pounds and leg press 250.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Truax has never married — “just lucky, I guess,” she jokes when I ask her about that — but she has remained social her entire life. She volunteers, goes to the gym, throws parties, knows her neighbors and their children by name. Truax says her secret to thriving as she ages is simple: Be active.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It turns out that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/08/28/thriving-at-90-super-ager-truax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research backs her up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re looking for more surprising, delightful stories about the best of humanity, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/optimist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;check out The Optimist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from The Washington Post.

Ask God to allow you to be canonized so I can finally take mommy on that trip to Italy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micah’s death comes amid a surge of severe flu cases impacting people of all ages, including children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child death toll from flu rose again this week as &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/flu-washington-japan-canada-united-kingdom-b2892431.html"&gt;cases of super flu continued to surge&lt;/a&gt; across more than a dozen states in the U.S. The nationwide tally ticked up to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;nine children&lt;/a&gt;, with health officials in Ohio and Kentucky reporting their &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/health/children-flu-hospital-rates-care-doctors-b2707352.html"&gt;first pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcements come on the heels of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/health/flu-symptoms-cases-spike-b2694411.html"&gt;worst flu season in nearly 15 years in 2024.&lt;/a&gt; This year, the agency &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that there have been 7.5 million infections, more than 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 flu deaths across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOeC1pVUJaYzJaT1dwbFM4dVE0Ulh5d3RrZVo4WjVFbGNNckFxYnAwakJBV0tMVmpGWktqQ2FlYjJhQzh4ckdFQkh1LTlWZ0ZCMzh1bnM5XzRwd2NHNjd3OWpNa184ZHRmRWNQcnpqR2g4VV9WVlJwN3RZWXZTaW51Rnln</guid></item><item><title>我最喜欢的高蛋白食谱帮助我减掉了25磅- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/this-high-protein-recipe-helped-me-lose-25-pounds-11874286</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a writer learned she had high blood sugar, she began searching for high-protein recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This simple, flavorful za’atar roasted chicken and chickpea recipe became one of her go-tos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more protein and fewer highly processed carbs helped her lose 25 pounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whenever your doctor says, “We need to talk about your blood work,” you know you’re in for a tough call.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;I was in my mid-40s and feeling pretty good about myself. Was I a health fanatic? No. But I went to the pool several times a week. I happily cooked most of my meals from scratch. I genuinely liked all fruits and vegetables, and I certainly didn’t need to be lectured on the evils of ultraprocessed foods. What could possibly be wrong with my bloodwork? Was there a problem?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Turns out, there wasn’t &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; problem. There were several. Among them were low iron and high blood sugar. It seems that a combination of perimenopause and a growing habit of eating toast for dinner when I was on deadline wasn’t exactly working in my favor. My doctor’s recommendations included meals that met three requirements: high fiber, low sugar and high protein. I knew what that meant. Legumes, and lots of them. I can’t say I was all that enthusiastic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I wasn’t against &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils, beans and chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, per se. They’re easy. They’re budget-friendly. They’re &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutritional superstars&lt;/a&gt;. They’re just so … sensible. Horribly sensible and terribly dull. I found myself recalling a lentil-and-sesame-seed cooking experiment that turned out to have the texture of sand, and I shuddered. My memories of a 12-bean potluck salad with zero seasoning were equally gloomy. As such, I set about my research with grim determination. Perhaps it’s no surprise that when I stumbled upon this &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;recipe for&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/zaatar-roasted-chicken-with-chickpeas-8786583" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; Za’atar-Roasted Chicken with Chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, I felt a glimmer of optimism. It looked like a recipe with potential. It looked like a recipe with &lt;em&gt;flavor.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;And it was. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this recipe changed my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It’s a chickpea-forward recipe with so much going on that it made me forget about my legume ambivalence. It doesn’t taste like the kind of recipe you eat after your doctor calls to lecture you about your blood work. But it absolutely should be. A generous amount of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908775/what-is-zaatar-everything-to-know-about-this-middle-eastern-spice-blend/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lemon juice and za’atar spice blend&lt;/a&gt; makes things sing. Throw in some onions, garlic and fresh herbs, and you have an absolute powerhouse of flavors. The chicken ups the protein factor, providing an impressive 29 grams per serving. And everything comes together in minutes with no fuss. It’s so good that I habitually swipe my fingers across the empty pan afterward, scooping up the last little bits of the earthy, punchy, tangy sauce. And, best of all, it has me eating my chickpeas without complaint.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While I’d happily eat this meal prepared exactly the way the recipe says, it didn’t take long before I started putting my own spin on things. It’s endlessly flexible and such a great way to use up leftover veggies. In summer, I was loading my tray with tiny cherry tomatoes from my garden. In the fall, Brussels sprouts were added to the mix. With winter rolling in, the sweet, peppery flavor of parsnips became a welcome addition. No matter what I did, everything came together in less than 15 minutes of hands-on time. Then I didn't have to do a thing until my timer dinged—perfect for when I’m so busy that I can barely look up from my work. And, for the first time ever, I actually started saving leftover chickpeas to eat the next day, usually for breakfast, in a quick hash and with a fried egg on top.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
As much as I’d like to joke around and dismiss them, there is no denying that chickpeas and other legumes are precisely what I need right now. &lt;a href="https://cathyrichardsrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cathy Richards, RD&lt;/a&gt;, wholeheartedly agrees. “As a registered dietitian, I often recommend chickpeas because they add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;satisfying protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-carbs-to-eat-11835357" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gut-loving fiber&lt;/a&gt; and a subtly nutty flavor to meals. They’re a simple, delicious way to boost both health and taste,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Legumes, like chickpeas, are also a food choice heartily endorsed by a myriad of health care organizations. That includes Diabetes Canada (in Canada, where I live) and the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; After all, chickpeas are rich in fiber (1 cup of canned chickpeas gives you nearly 10 grams). They’re also a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-glycemic-index choice&lt;/a&gt;, which is key for anyone grappling with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It doesn’t hurt that they also give you a little bit of iron, providing 8% of the Daily Value per cup. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;OK, legumes. I’m starting to get the hype. Is there anything you can’t do?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I didn’t set out to lose weight. I’m lucky to have a doctor who cares about more numbers than just the ones on the scale. I was focused on making changes that would improve both my blood sugar and my iron levels. But those changes, including increasing my intake of fiber and lean proteins while cutting back on high-glycemic index foods, like white carbohydrates, align closely with tried-and-true weight-loss advice. As such, working this &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8017960/cozy-sheet-pan-dinners-with-three-steps-or-less/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;super-easy sheet-pan meal&lt;/a&gt; into my weekly meal rotation for the past year has helped me lose 25 pounds and counting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;However, I’m even more thrilled that my blood work has significantly improved. Best of all, these changes feel sustainable. This recipe feels like I’m nourishing myself, taking care of myself and finding what works for me, my health and my cooking style. Who would have thought that prosaic ol’ chickpeas would be at the forefront of that?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finding out your blood sugar is high can come as a surprise. But small changes, like having a go-to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7948927/best-15-minute-dinner-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quick, healthy recipe&lt;/a&gt; you love—like this easy roasted chicken and chickpea dish—can help you get things back on track. Combined with eating more lean protein and fewer highly processed carbs, it may even help you lose some weight.&lt;br&gt;

The brain continuously processes sights, sounds, and internal thoughts, and focus depends on its ability to ignore distractions while responding to what matters. Most current treatments improve attention by increasing activity in brain circuits that control focus, especially in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a different solution. Instead of increasing brain activity, the research points to reducing baseline activity as a way to lower mental noise and improve attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Gene Linked to Calmer Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, scientists report that a gene called &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; plays an important role in attention by shaping how quiet or noisy the brain is at rest. Mice with reduced levels of two specific forms of this gene showed calmer brain activity and performed better on tasks requiring focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings may represent an early step toward new treatments aimed at calming the mind rather than stimulating it. The implications extend beyond ADHD, since &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; has also been linked to disorders involving early sensory processing differences, including autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gene we found has a striking effect on attention and is relevant to humans," says Priya Rajasethupathy, head of the Skoler Horbach Family Laboratory of Neural Dynamics and Cognition at Rockefeller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Unexpected Genetic Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the research team began exploring the genetics of attention, &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; was not an obvious candidate. Scientists have long known the gene for its role in neurotransmission, and many interacting proteins of &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; have appeared in genetic studies of attention disorders, but &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; itself had not previously stood out as a key driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate more broadly, the researchers analyzed the genomes of nearly 200 mice bred from eight different parental strains, including some with wild ancestry. This approach was designed to reflect the genetic diversity seen in human populations and allowed subtle genetic influences to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was a Herculean effort, and really novel for the field," says Rajasethupathy, who credits PhD student Zachary Gershon for leading the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Large Genetic Effect on Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large-scale genetic analysis revealed a clear pattern. Mice that performed best on attention tasks had much lower levels of &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region essential for focus. The gene was located within a stretch of DNA that explained nearly 20 percent of the variation in attention among the mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[That's] a huge effect," Rajasethupathy says. "Even accounting for any overestimation here of the size of this effect, which can happy for many reasons, that's a remarkable number. Most of the time, you're lucky if you find a gene that affects even 1 percent of a trait."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing Is Critical During Brain Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that not all forms of &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; contributed equally. Two specific versions, known as &lt;em&gt;Homer1a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ania3&lt;/em&gt;, were responsible for the attention differences. Mice that excelled at attention tasks naturally had lower levels of these versions in their prefrontal cortex, while other forms of the gene were unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researchers experimentally reduced &lt;em&gt;Homer1a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ania3&lt;/em&gt; during a brief developmental period in adolescent mice, the effects were striking. The animals became faster, more accurate, and less distractible across several behavioral tests. Making the same changes in adult mice produced no benefit, showing that &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; influences attention during a limited early-life window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Quieting the Brain Improves Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unexpected insight came from examining how &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; affects brain cells. Lowering &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; levels in prefrontal cortex neurons caused those cells to increase GABA receptors -- the molecular brakes of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change reduced unnecessary background firing while preserving strong, focused bursts of activity when important cues appeared. Instead of responding constantly, neurons conserved their activity for moments that required attention, leading to more accurate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were sure that the more attentive mice would have more activity in the prefrontal cortex, not less," Rajasethupathy says. "But it made some sense. Attention is, in part, about blocking everything else out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Calmer Way to Think About Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gershon, who lives with ADHD, the findings felt intuitive. "It's part of my story," he says, "and one of the inspirations for me wanting to apply genetic mapping to attention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also the first in the lab to notice that lowering &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; improved focus by reducing distractions. In his view, the results align with common experiences. "Deep breathing, mindfulness, meditation, calming the nervous system -- people consistently report better focus following these activities," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Future Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for attention disorders typically increase excitatory signaling in prefrontal brain circuits using stimulant medications. The new findings point toward a different possibility: therapies that improve attention by calming neural activity instead of amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; and its interacting proteins have been linked to ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism, further research may reshape how scientists understand multiple neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies from the Rajasethupathy lab will focus on refining the genetic understanding of attention, with the goal of developing therapies that precisely adjust &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a splice site in &lt;em&gt;Homer1&lt;/em&gt; that can be pharmacologically targeted, which may be an ideal way to help dial the knob on brain signal-to-noise levels," Rajasethupathy says. "This offers a tangible path toward creating a medication that has a similar quieting effect as meditation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early puppyhood is often filled with clumsy movements, curious discoveries, and moments that are unintentionally hilarious. For many pet parents, these fleeting stages pass quickly, making them worth capturing on camera whenever possible. One such moment recently caught the internet’s attention, thanks to a short but charming video of a Golden Retriever puppy figuring out how his body works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-shows-golden-retriever-puppy-walk-in-reverse-because-he-can-t-turn-around"&gt;Video shows Golden Retriever puppy walk in reverse because he can’t turn around&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent video shared by @adventures.of.pilot, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy called Pilot is attempting to navigate his surroundings but ends up walking backward instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Onscreen text explains the situation: “Enjoy this video of my puppy walking in reverse because he didn’t know how to turn around.” The puppy takes hesitant, wobbly steps as he slowly backs up, appearing genuinely unsure of what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilot is also wearing a small harness, which some viewers speculated may have added to his confusion. Whether it was the harness or simply a case of puppy brain, the result was a hilarious and wholesome scene. As he carefully reverses, his movements are cautious but determined, as if he believes backing up is the only logical solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for the clip to gain traction. The video quickly racked up more than 310K likes and drew over a hundred comments from viewers who related to Pilot’s behavior or simply found it hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many shared stories of their own dogs going through similar phases, noting how common it is for puppies to struggle with basic movements as they learn coordination and spatial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One viewer jokingly wrote “beep beep beep,” comparing Pilot’s backward steps to a vehicle reversing. Another called him “a little goofball,” while someone else said their own puppy looked like he was “processing how to walk” during his early days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One popular comment summed up the playful tone by saying Golden Retrievers are “just orange cats in disguise,” joking that they all seem to share “one single brain cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The study also allowed for factors like smoking and alcohol consumption to better isolate the effects of coffee drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that drinking around three cups of coffee a day was associated with an extra 1.8 years of life, with regular cups also being associated with increased health span (time spent living free from serious disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study noted that having coffee regularly appears to aid muscular, cardiovascular, mental, and immune system functions. What's more, it may be linked to a lower risk of developing some of the most frequent diseases affecting older adults, like cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, stroke, some cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a69811738/diabetics-tip-for-lowering-blood-sugar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, dementia, depression, or frailty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s so special about coffee? Coffee contains phytonutrients and antioxidants that help reduce chronic &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a37712047/inflammation-signs-and-treatments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is important in longevity, said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/melissa-ann-prest" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/about/g26577234/medical-review-board/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention Medical Review Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; Medical Review Board&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Researchers are also exploring the role of caffeine and how it can be beneficial in different health conditions,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular coffee consumption has been associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality due to its protective effects against several major causes of death, including cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer, and respiratory conditions, said &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/adedapo-adeyinka-iluyomade/2103193" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, preventative cardiologist with Baptist Health Miami Cardiac &amp;amp; Vascular Institute. “Coffee contains bioactive compounds such as caffeine and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4728630/#:~:text=Chlorogenic%20acids%20(CGAs)%20are%20esters,%2Dcoumaroylquinic%2C%20and%20feruloyquinic%20acids." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chlorogenic acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chlorogenic acids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [polyphenols], which &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a44653890/does-coffee-cause-inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mitigate inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mitigate inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysfunction, promoting healthier aging and longevity,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of coffee seen in this study are likely due to a combination of caffeine and other compounds like chlorogenic acids, Dr. Iluyomade continued. “These findings emphasize the importance of consuming coffee without excessive additives such as sugar or cream, which can offset its health advantages.” Future research may further clarify personalized recommendations based on genetic and metabolic differences, he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway from this research is that moderate coffee consumption is not only safe but can also be part of a healthy lifestyle that promotes longevity and reduces the risk of chronic diseases, said Dr. Iluyomade. “These findings are important as they challenge old misconceptions about coffee being harmful and instead position it as a functional food with significant health benefits,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to start drinking more coffee (or just continue to enjoy your morning cup of joe), Dr. Iluyomade explained that studies indicate that the optimal intake for longevity benefits lies around &lt;strong&gt;2 to 3 cups per day&lt;/strong&gt;. “This level maximizes the health benefits while minimizing potential adverse effects,” he said. Excessive coffee consumption, generally above four to six cups per day, may increase the risk of side effects such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a36621407/caffeine-and-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anxiety&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, restlessness, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a44211864/insomnia-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insomnia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and gastrointestinal discomfort, he explained. The data collected in the study supports this: The researchers found that health benefits peaked at three cups of coffee per day and declined as coffee consumption increased beyond that. What's more, if you have severe high blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/drinking-2-or-more-cups-of-coffee-daily-may-double-risk-of-heart-death-in-people-with-severe-hypertension" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have shown that drinking two or more cups of coffee a day may double the risk of death from cardiovascular disease—so ask your doctor before dramatically increasing your caffeine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enjoying coffee, remember to be mindful of what you add to it, Mroz-Planells said. To maximize the health benefits of your favorite brew, “stick with lower-fat milk or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a45322121/expert-approved-vegan-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based alternatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;plant-based alternatives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and lower-sugar sweeteners.” Or better yet, drink it black—you'll get all the benefits with very few downsides. And consider trading your coffee for a different drink in the afternoon.

						&lt;p&gt;UNC Health's Triangle-area hospitals will implement temporary visitor restrictions on Monday, Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The resetrictions include measures as:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors 11 years old and younger will be prohibited from all hospital inpatient areas and waiting areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors older than 11 with respiratory symptoms will be prohibited from inpatient areas and waiting areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All employees at designated inpatient locations will be required to wear a mask while providing care. Masks are not required, but strongly encouraged, for patients and visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Affected facilities include UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill and Hillsborough, UNC Health Rex in Raleigh and Holly Springs, UNC Health Chatham in Siler City, and UNC Health Johnston in Clayton and Smithfield. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The restrictions have been put in place in recent years during the cold weather months when respiratory illnesses increase. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the state saw a significant jump in emergency room admissions from flu-like illnesses last week. Approximately 2,000 people had flu-like symptoms, according to &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard"&gt;data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 39 people have died from the flu so far this winter in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;SEMINOLE — When Anita Froese’s middle daughter came down with fatigue, body aches and the tell-tale sign of measles — strawberry-colored spots splattered across her skin — she waited it out. Two days later, her son developed the same symptoms. After a week, the disease finally reached her youngest daughter, who vomited all night as her fever spiked to 104.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froese never brought her children to a doctor. Instead, she administered cod liver oil, vitamins, tea and broth. She refreshed their cold compresses and ran them epsom salt baths. She brought them to a holistic health center for an IV treatment used for heavy metal poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of her kids are fully vaccinated against measles. She stopped immunizing her first two as infants after hearing stories about others who had bad reactions to the shots, and she approved no shots for her third. Even as an outbreak ripped through her community, Froese preferred that her children contract measles to build natural immunity because to her, measles was on par with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like this was a disease that had come up now and was this big deal,” said Froese, who was vaccinated as a child. “To me, that wasn’t the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But outside of the West Texas town of 7,000, health experts watched in horror as the once-dormant disease spread like a drop of blood in water across Seminole and the outlying counties, hitting at least three other states and breaching international borders. It killed two children, both Mennonites like Froese. It sickened at least 762 Texans — more than half of whom live in Seminole’s Gaines County — and hospitalized 99 statewide. The West Texas outbreak was the nation’s largest in more than 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the Mennonites at the center of it, the scrutiny was worse than the disease itself. Today, Froese and others say they’re no more likely to get vaccinated, and they’re even less trusting of the government and health officials who they feel targeted them and blamed them for causing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mennonites questioned why measles forced their religious community into the national spotlight. They didn’t know why TV crews clamored to film them grieving little girls who they believed died from underlying conditions or negligent hospitals rather than measles. They didn’t understand the messages from outsiders demanding they leave the country for exercising their right to not vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re looked at as this ignorant people that’s almost fueling this thing, like we’re having measles parties, and that was never the case,” said Pastor Jake Fehr of Mennonite Evangelical Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The religious group is a microcosm of the distrust in vaccines gripping the state. Twice as many Texas parents exempted their kindergartners from measles vaccines this year compared to five years ago, with Gaines County among the highest at almost 20% of its kindergartners being exempt, compared to the state average of less than 4%. Seminole’s vaccination rate is likely far lower when it includes the Mennonites who are homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the world’s &lt;a href="https://apic.org/measles/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;most infectious&lt;/a&gt; diseases, measles causes rash and flu-like symptoms and was for many years rare in the U.S. because of widespread vaccination. Especially in young children, measles can cause complications like blindness, brain swelling and even death. Two doses of the measles vaccine are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at avoiding the disease, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials declared the outbreak over in August — ending an event Froese thinks was inflated from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know of plenty of people that had measles when they were children, and they all survived,” Froese said. “To me, that was a risk I was willing to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As measles tore through his community last winter, John Peters, 54, feared the disease was causing his pallor, ringing ears, body pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, after his Mennonite mettle crumbled against his wife’s demand that he seek help, he finally saw a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t have measles. He had leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters got seven blood transfusions in a week, and six more over the next three months. When he returned from a hospital stay in the spring, he regretted high-fiving a blotchy child at the grocery store. He changed his immigration consulting firm to appointment-only and asked clients to wash their hands and stay home if they had been around sick people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had zero immunity,” he said. “I could not afford to get measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters, who trusts mainstream medicine, considers himself a modern Mennonite. He wears a goatee and a Texas Tech University ring, which traditional Mennonites consider vain. He owns 17 guns even though Mennonites are pacifists. Despite his neighbors avoiding the public eye, Peters is a town celebrity because he hosts a weekly radio show and pens monthly columns in the local newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother grew up in a Mennonite colony in Mexico and combined natural and Western medicine. She administered Tylenol and Vicks VapoRub, smeared pig lard on her children’s chests to relieve congestion and believed Dr. Pepper was a cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mennonites are predisposed to questioning vaccine mandates. Their history of persecution from political and religious authorities has created a culture of distrust in the government. The Mennonite movement broke from Anabaptists in 16th century Northern Europe, moving through Russia, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. in sequestered communities — Peters estimates that a third of Mennonites in West Texas are undocumented. While some Mennonite groups are integrated in society, many Mennonite women in Seminole still know only Low German, which is spoken in Northern Germany and parts of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite valuing traditional remedies, Peters’ mom was vaccinated as a child and she would later immunize her children, including Peters. She fell in line with much of her generation of Mennonites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t argue the fact that vaccinated people fight measles better,” Peters said, adding that he vaccinated his two daughters after doing research and talking to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters’ take on health care is a product of both his past and present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against his doctors’ advice, Peters drank a fruit juice that Mennonites insisted would cure his cancer and which he said tastes like rotten cherries. He drew the line at offers from friends and another leukemia patient to take the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, opting to give his $15,000 monthly prescription a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He appreciates unorthodox approaches to medicine — like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoting vitamin A to treat measles — and he speculates that natural remedies could be as effective as vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he wishes more of his community vaccinated because he knows vaccines eradicated polio. Before the measles shot became available in 1963, the disease killed 400 to 500 American children each year. Peters believes modern medicine is why he’s here today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hospital system saved my life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the measles outbreak endangered him in his vulnerable condition, it also solidified his views against forced immunizations. He wondered whether his two rounds of COVID shots could have caused his leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, pushes for Mennonites to vaccinate and quarantine gave Peters flashbacks to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already opposed to government rules, Mennonites bristled at pressure from authorities to stick out their arms during the 2020 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pro-vax crowd, I think in my opinion, has kind of messed up,” Peters said. “If you’re living in the land of the free and you pretty much have to get vaccinated, to the third generation Mennonites — the kids that grew up here — that just doesn’t sound right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

She skipped only one Sunday mass when her teens were sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went about life normally because she believed measles wasn’t a threat to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As sick as they were, they’ve been just as sick with other things that they’ve had in the past, just then they didn’t have the rash,” she said. “And they got it, they got over it, and we went on with life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She disavowed vaccines after hearing about children of people she knew who were never the same after they received the shot: a young boy gone blind, and a girl who seized and foamed at the mouth, becoming a quadriplegic, she said. Local Mennonite shop owners, church-goers and pastors cite similar stories, saying the risk isn’t worth the immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have proven time and again that vaccines have a &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/0615/p786.html" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;low risk&lt;/a&gt; of severe complications, though mild effects are common as the body builds protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know whether vaccines caused these maladies without the patients’ full medical history, said Wesley Friesen, a Mennonite operating room nurse at the Seminole Hospital District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to trust that what they’re telling you is true. But sometimes you wonder, what’s the whole story?” Friesen said, expressing skepticism about whether serious vaccine complications resulted from the medicine. “There are individuals that did experience negative side effects, probably, you know, for decades. But you have to look at the whole picture. I mean, are they basing their decision on a relatively small percentage?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As measles spread, local health food stores began distributing unconventional treatments including free cod liver oil and budesonide inhalers, which are typically used for asthma, while vitamin A &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;flew off&lt;/a&gt; the shelves. Mennonites reached for wonder oil — herb-infused rubbing alcohol to reduce fevers — and supplements that claim to enhance various bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some Seminole residents got vaccinated amid the outbreak, drive-by vaccine tents largely sat dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Peters, Froese also believes COVID turned more Mennonites off vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought authorities overreacted to scare people into getting immunized. The restrictions felt overbearing and punitive: A local hospital limited visits, leaving Froese’s children to gaze at their cancer-ridden grandmother through the window for what they thought would be the last time. She was alarmed when a hospital refused to administer ivermectin to her father-in-law, though global health authorities recommend against treating COVID-19 with ivermectin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know when you’re dealing with something that you don’t understand, you know, for the doctors, even they have to do something that they then think works,” Froese said. “But again, I think COVID was blown out of proportion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so was the measles outbreak, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovering, her daughters shed hair for two months and one developed an acne-like condition that vitamins couldn’t treat, but antibiotics did. Measles can cause &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia#:~:text=This%20leaves%20the%20person%20susceptible,had%20received%20the%20MMR%20vaccine." class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;“immune amnesia,”&lt;/a&gt; where the body forgets how to fight infections for months to years, but Froese questions whether the after effects of measles are as bad as doctors and public health authorities have made them out to be, and whether the skin condition was related to measles at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s proud of how her community responded to the outbreak and now believes more strongly that they can fend off diseases without official help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were getting so much media attention and blame for all this kind of stuff,” Froese said. “And I think we all just decided that we would rally together and get through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent Sunday, more than 170 cars filled the gravel parking lot of the Mennonite Evangelical Church in Seminole. In a pew facing walls decorated with two plain wreaths, a man in scuffed cowboy boots wrapped his arm around his wife, who wore an ankle-length velvet dress, emerald green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their five children had recovered from measles, and in July, one daughter won gold in the national tumbling competition. The disease was behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early December, almost a year from the start of the outbreak, 17 new cases appeared in the U.S. If these strains share DNA with those in West Texas, the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/05/texas-measles-outbreak-spread-elimination/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;might follow&lt;/a&gt; Canada in losing its measles elimination status, which it’s had for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least in Seminole, people are safe from another measles event because they’ve either been vaccinated or fought the disease, said Dr. Wendell Parkey, chief of staff for Seminole Memorial Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he’s now staring down the barrel of a different vaccine-preventable outbreak: whooping cough. He thinks all the medical community can do now is adapt their practices to prepare for more sick people each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want a society like this. I’d rather be in a society that vaccinates,” Parkey said. “But you don’t get a choice on playing that game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials spread the word about the importance of measles vaccines in person and through the radio, newspapers and churches. Local doctors and Mennonite experts fear the town’s anti-vaccine camp will respond the same to the next outbreak unless authorities learn to speak their figurative — and sometimes literal — language to answer their questions and build confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Seminole residents circulated messages to avoid reporters during the outbreak, John Dueck, editor of the Canada-based newspaper Die Mennonitische Post, became a de facto Mennonite expert for government officials and news media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dueck published an editorial explaining the facts about measles and vaccines in terms that appealed to Mennonite values about protecting the community. He said Mennonites and the Canadian government gave him positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you come into a community just in time when everything is burning, you will find people nervous,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they might be more receptive to messages from authorities about vaccines and health scares if they already formed a relationship during calm times, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seminole doctors worry that will be tough after the measles outbreak whittled what scant trust remained among the vaccine hesitant community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some Mennonite families got vaccinated during the outbreak, Friesen said health messaging fell short because it came across as orders. He said a better approach is to teach people how vaccines work and invite questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I guess we haven’t figured that out yet,” Friesen said. “Nothing has changed, and I don’t think it’s going to change for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/corrections/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;Clarification, Dec. 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. Central :&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story has been updated to clarify how many undocumented Mennonites are estimated to reside in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/17/texas-measles-mennonite-seminole-aftermath/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Texas Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright 2026 High Plains Public Radio&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you frequently experience post-meal symptoms like stomach pain or bloating, research suggests that a cup of ginger tea might help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ginger tea is a very helpful after-dinner tea as it can help soothe your gut,” said &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, MS, RD,&lt;/a&gt; a nutrition lecturer at California State University, Long Beach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger tea is one of the easiest ways to prepare ginger because all it requires is fresh ginger root and water. Boil 1 inch of sliced ginger in 1 cup of water for roughly 10-15 minutes, or even longer if you like a stronger tea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sauceda also recommended combining ginger tea with other spices, such as &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/peppermint-tea-8420406" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;peppermint&lt;/a&gt; and cinnamon, for added digestive support.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cinnamon has been researched for having blood sugar benefits so having it with ginger makes it a good after-dinner tea,” she said.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sticking with the theme of drinking ginger, a little ginger in your morning or post-workout protein shake can go a long way.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger provides the gut-health benefits while Greek yogurt and milk kick up the protein—and of course, the fresh fruits and vegetables are full of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/soluble-vs-insoluble-fiber-7093262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, said Saucedo.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since fresh ginger can pack quite a punch, just a small amount can go a long way for a spicy kick. If you’re looking for more of a mild flavor, however, ginger powder, made from dried ginger root, can be a great fresh ginger substitute in smoothies.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the easiest ways to increase fiber in your diet is by eating more vegetables, and what’s easier than adding a side salad to your lunch or dinner? Instead of throwing a few slices of ginger on your salad, try adding a &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/healthiest-salad-dressings-11767651" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger dressing&lt;/a&gt; instead.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a quick and easy ginger salad dressing, whisk together olive oil, sesame oil, rice vinegar, grated ginger, grated garlic, and a dash of soy sauce and honey.

Each participant provided information on their daily consumption of coffee, tea, and water, along with other lifestyle habits and their health history. The result: people who divided their daily fluid intake between several drinks—especially water, coffee, and tea—had a lower mortality risk than those who concentrated mainly on just one drink. The most favorable ratio of coffee to tea netted out at two cups of coffee for every three cups of tea—i.e., if you've already had one of each and still want another, grab a tea next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pattern that stood out particularly positively was when coffee and tea were consumed together. In moderate quantities, supplemented by sufficient water, this combination was most common among the participants with the best long-term health values. The decisive factor here was, above all, about balance: neither excessive coffee consumption nor drinking only water or tea scored best, but the mixture throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Which factors are really decisive in the combination of drinks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study emphasize that the results are based on observations. This means that they show correlations, but do not prove any direct causes. Nevertheless, the results fit in well with what we already know. While coffee and tea provide natural plant substances, water supports basic processes in the body. Together, they could ensure that the body is well hydrated and at the same time benefits from things like antioxidants in coffee and tea, which studies have linked to anti-inflammatory effects, better vascular function, and a more stable metabolism—all factors that are also relevant for life expectancy in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is particularly interesting to note is that drinking water alone was not automatically associated with the best results. Although drinking enough remains an important basis for good health, the analysis shows that water is particularly beneficial when it is part of a varied beverage pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5abDJpYVNWU2JvNEhtcnpNSDBrWEhVRmw1aHNtendHOWd0REJ5WU9lVHpuYlM2WTdCTjFlaC14UjFJUVpHSGJEQUNsbVctUWFVNTVfaUE2TEMteDdmN1diQmlpbGJINjFkNGItQjc1Zw</guid></item><item><title>您应该在适当的时候服用3种补充剂，以获得更好的效果- Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/supplements-to-take-at-the-right-time-11868429</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The timing of when you take some supplements matters.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it in the morning for energy&lt;/strong&gt;: Taking B12 in the morning or early afternoon can help boost your energy. This is because B12 helps your body convert food into energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it on an empty stomach&lt;/strong&gt;: Taking it on an empty stomach helps improve absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid taking it with certain foods or beverages&lt;/strong&gt;: High amounts of vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) can reduce B12's absorption if consumed at the same time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space it apart from medications&lt;/strong&gt;: Separate B12 and medications such as metformin and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/proton-pump-inhibitors-what-they-do-and-how-they-work-8727585" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proton pump inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; by at least four hours to ensure optimal absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body produces vitamin D when you are exposed to sunlight. Since it's challenging to get sufficient vitamin D from food alone, consider &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-foods-immune-health-5094903" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplementing during the winter months&lt;/a&gt; when sunlight is limited, especially if you have limited sun exposure.

I press my face into my damp pillow to mute the occasional, plaintive chirp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much of a crier, so these late-night keening sessions make no sense. I’m a 59-year-old, happily married woman, and my children are healthy and grown, yet when the lights go out and the world lies down, a single phrase repeats itself in my mind: &lt;em&gt;I want my mom. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother isn’t missing or gone. She lives a short 20-minute drive away in an assisted living facility. When I visit, she looks like herself, shorter than me, hair dyed brown and styled in pert curls, with a smile people say looks like mine. When she speaks, her word choices, her intonations and the way she moves her hands are all her, but if you sit with her for more than a few minutes, you learn she’s less like herself and more like a carnival hologram — repeating a limited, looping set of thoughts and comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have nine windows in my apartment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My cat is the best roommate I’ve ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did I tell you your husband reminds me of my dad?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, my mother had been single and independent, living on her own, volunteering and singing in a local chorale. At 78, she was in excellent health and had great energy, so I was taken by surprise when she announced she’d be moving into a retirement community near my home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An old folks’ home?” I said. “But you’re in great shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a ‘home,’ it’s a retirement village. Just like apartment living, but I don’t have to cook anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No loss for the world there,” I snorted, and she elbowed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, we visited the facility, more like a resort with scheduled activities and concerts than the 1970s nursing home my paternal grandmother had lived and died in. But still. Weaving through walkers and motorized scooters to get to the facility’s restaurant, I said, “These people, they’re nice, but they seem… elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She squared off with me. At 5’1”, she projects an air of sweet amiability, but she’s actually stubborn as an old root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mother was sick my entire childhood,” she said. It was true. Her poor mother suffered for nine years, Bible in hand and disapproval on her face, until she finally died, releasing my 17-year-old mother. “I’m not doing that to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not remotely the same! I’m older, and you’re not sick, or nasty.” I looked at her sideways. “At least most of the time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our way out, we passed a locked industrial door, behind which was the “Assisted Living Wing” and “Memory Ward.” Pastel-colored cutouts of flowers and butterflies, the sort you’d see taped to a nursery school wall, decorated the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s in there?” I asked, and made scary ghost sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You, if you keep it up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It never occurred to me there might be something she wasn’t telling me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, age 2, with her mother&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 12, 2020, the day after Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced they had COVID-19, my mother’s Toyota Camry pulled into my driveway, and out she stepped with two suitcases, the food from her refrigerator, her recycling and her cat, named Jello, howling and spitting in its carrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just until we flatten the curve,” she said, reluctant to leave her apartment. “And not a minute more.” She lived with me for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother and I are different people. She’s fussy. I’m casual — sloppy, even. She’s soft-spoken. I’m loud. She’s ladylike. I intentionally storm through a room. And while I know I’m not the refined young lady she hoped for as a daughter, she’s been my champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I hated wearing dresses, so she sewed me pants. And when a male teacher told her, “Your daughter must wear dresses to school — pants are inappropriate,” she fired back, “You’re either going to let her wear pants, or you’re going to see her underwear, because she’s always upside-down on the monkey bars!” I got to wear pants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we managed to find joy and beauty in our togetherness during the lockdown. We visited the local arboretum, haunted our old town, even had a picnic on the porch of our old house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody lives here! Who’s going to care?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We peeked in the windows and tried to see if any doors were unlocked. She stood watch for me while I crawled under the porch to see if old treasures I had hidden were still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nothing but spiders and dirt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited her room daily with chocolate chip cookies. “Wellness check,” I’d say, and she’d invite me into her too-warm space. I’d nudge Jello, ever a grumpy thing, off the armchair and sit down for a quick chat over the blaring television. It was during one of those visits that I first noticed something was off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mom, you shouldn’t watch the news 24 hours a day. It’s grim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I leave it on for the company — the voices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You live with me. That’s enough voices for anyone. If you have to watch TV, can you at least watch &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/netflix"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;?” I handed her the remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That thing’s too complicated. I like the news,” she said and took a dainty bite of her cookie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For goodness’ sake! You just push this button here that says Netflix.” She waved me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, she poured laundry detergent into our dryer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said. “I’ll pay for it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s no big deal,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d once put the cereal box in the fridge and the milk in the cupboard. Our family can be spacey like that, so I wrote it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as her memory glitched more frequently, I found myself becoming impatient. It was easier to be annoyed with her, easier to look away from what might be happening to her, from what might one day happen to me. It was easier to imagine she was being lazy-minded or stubborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just met with your surgeon two weeks ago, don’t you remember? Your pain is coming from your spine, not your hip, so you have to do physical therapy,” I told her one afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DO YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPY! And can you wear your hearing aids? It’s very annoying to repeat myself all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like physical therapy,” she said. “And anyway, you’re the only one I can’t hear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"This is Jello, and he's daring me to even think about coming any closer," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our arguments regressed. We were silly, a little petty, almost joking, but not quite. I found myself using the same words she’d spoken to me when I was young, pantomiming a role reversal we didn’t realize was well underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do as you’re told!” I’d demand, only half joking when she ate mostly chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re not the boss of me!” she’d say, and cross her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then she drove into oncoming traffic with my daughter in the car. It was a close call — the other car swerved. My daughter told me she’d never let Grandma drive her again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I took her keys that day, but I didn’t. It’s difficult — removing your parents’ means of transportation. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/uber"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; generation. You take their keys, you take their independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I called my mother while waiting in the social distancing line that snaked around Trader Joe’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank goodness you called! My phone isn’t working!” she said, breathless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re on your phone now, Mom,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t call anyone. I couldn’t find anyone’s numbers. I was all alone!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t upsetting that she couldn’t work her phone for a moment — many older people struggle with technology. It was upsetting that she was panicked, desperate and at a loss for what to do, when really, all she had to do was step out of her bedroom and ask any of her grandchildren for assistance. It was upsetting because she felt helpless and afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s going on, Mom?” I asked when I got home. It never occurred to me she could be any other than the way I had always known her: capable, pragmatic and independent. I didn’t know that these days — the early days — were the good days when she remembered where she was, who she was, who I was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day I took her keys was the day she mistook my daughter for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It was easier to be annoyed with her, easier to look away from what might be happening to her, from what might one day happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As intelligent, sentient beings, we sure can be shockingly unaware of our own emotions and why we’re feeling them. Recently, I was hiking in a forest near my home. I came upon an elderly woman in hiking boots sitting on a fallen tree near a brook, leaning on her walking stick. I couldn’t imagine how she had gotten there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She smiled. “I’m just taking a breather. I live a mile up there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed her stick up the steep, wooded hill. She’d come from Sweden decades earlier to marry an American who’d recently moved them into a retirement home. Like my mother, she was born on the cusp of World War II. Unlike my mother, she spoke about politics, current events, a book she was reading. Then she got up and stretched. I didn’t want her to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can I visit you, maybe help with your errands?” I asked. She looked at me, puzzled, and I felt instant embarrassment. This was not a woman who needed help with her errands. She had just walked a mile into the woods. Why would she need me to visit her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my husband’s pandemic projects was to hang birdhouses all around our yard. A storm knocked one down, and four bluish babies with giant open mouths tumbled out onto the grass. Blind, chirping and barely able to move, they reminded me of the P.D. Eastman book “Are You My Mother?” about a baby bird who searches for his mother. He asks everything he comes across: a dog, a hen, a steam shovel, “Are you my mother?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I slid a spoon under the wobbly birds’ bodies and poured them back into their home, I was struck by a thought: &lt;em&gt;I’m the baby bird in P.D. Eastman’s book. I’m looking for my mother, who is slipping away from me. And the lovely Swedish woman in the woods? She is not my mother. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author with her mother. "We were off on some pandemic adventure," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months after my mom packed up Jello and moved back to her apartment, I got a call from the onsite nurse explaining she had accidentally consumed five weeks’ medication in two weeks. It was time for her to move into assisted living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remembered the door with the flowers and butterflies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe she saw this coming. I believe she knew her mind was slipping, so she moved herself into a place where, at some point, she could get professional care, and where, like she said, she wouldn’t become a “burden.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the things she says in her moments of clarity is, “My parents died young. I didn’t have anyone to model getting old for me.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to her, I do. And thanks to her, as the child of a person who is getting old, I’m learning to be more patient, more understanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I call her daily. I visit her often. And every now and then, the mother I know returns for a cameo, then disappears just as quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her darker moments, she tells me, “I’ve had a good life, but if I could push a button and end it now, I would.” I’d like to tell her to hang on — that things will get better — but we both know that’s not true. So I just remind her she is beloved. And we list all the people who’ve loved her in her life, including the boyfriend she dumped in college. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m learning to love her differently, perhaps more deeply and from a place of gratitude, not of need and expectation. I’m trying to be the grown-up now — to champion her, the way she did me. It’s not easy. And in the wee hours of the night, when the loss of my mother as I knew her overtakes me, I allow myself to have a cry in my pillow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kathryn Smith has published fiction and creative nonfiction in Philadelphia Stories, poetry in Apiary, and twice won an honorable mention from Glimmer Train.

&lt;li&gt;For an extra-potent strawberry flavor, try using strawberry milk, or add a scoop of strawberry-flavored protein powder to get a boost of protein too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can garnish with any berry of your choice in addition to strawberries, as well as add a sprinkling of granola.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For extra pizzazz, top the pudding with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7953463/magic-chocolate-drizzle/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chocolate shell&lt;/a&gt; by melting dark chocolate and a bit of coconut oil together. Pour on top of the peanut butter mixture in the jar and chill for 10 minutes until the shell is hardened. Add a dash of flaky salt, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To save time, you can skip making the peanut butter mixture and simply swirl peanut butter on top of the pudding. However, choose a peanut butter made with just peanuts and one that’s more liquid than solid so you get a perfect consistency.&lt;/li&gt;

Much of the fat in chia seeds is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are known to reduce inflammation and lower disease risk. The fiber in chia seeds feeds your beneficial bacteria and helps keep things moving through your gut. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based milks&lt;/a&gt; that naturally contains protein.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten thousand steps a day&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most widely recognised numbers in modern health culture. It appears on fitness trackers, in health guidelines and across marketing campaigns. Despite its ubiquity, the origin of this figure is not medical. It began as a product slogan in 1960s Japan, not as a clinical recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent research has begun to challenge this long-standing benchmark. Multiple large-scale studies have found that the health benefits associated with walking may begin at lower daily step counts, and that the 10,000-step target may overstate what is necessary for longevity, disease prevention and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Walking remains one of the most accessible forms of physical activity. It is particularly relevant as public health agencies look for low-cost interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour and improve population-level outcomes. However, guidance on &lt;strong&gt;how many steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; are needed is now shifting toward a more evidence-based and personalised model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Step Counts and Mortality Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; tracked nearly 5,000 adults and found that those who walked &lt;strong&gt;8,000 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; had a 51 percent lower &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/bill-gates-admits-i-thought-i-was-one-mistake-away-from-death-with-microsoft-until-the-late-90s/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73393" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of death &lt;/a&gt;from all causes compared with individuals who walked 4,000 steps. The study also reported no significant impact from walking speed. Step volume alone was the defining factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further analysis from &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/how-many-steps-do-you-need-day-see-health-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt; notes that walking as few as &lt;strong&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; contributes to improved longevity, with benefits rising steadily up to about 8,000 steps. Among adults over 60, health improvements plateaued between &lt;strong&gt;6,000 and 8,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;, while for those under 60, the upper limit of gains appeared near &lt;strong&gt;10,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate 2022 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, walking between 8,000 and 10,000 steps per day was associated with lower risk of developing or dying from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/people-who-sleep-like-this-every-night-are-facing-dangerously-high-heart-risks-reveals-major-new-study/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="96135" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found no additional benefit beyond that range, indicating that efforts to exceed it may not yield proportional improvements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Weight Loss and Activity Intensity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although moderate daily steps may support general health, individuals targeting &lt;strong&gt;weight loss through walking&lt;/strong&gt; require greater volumes and structured activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data compiled by &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-miles-should-i-walk-a-day-8690702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/a&gt; shows that walking &lt;strong&gt;10,000 to 12,000 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; can support sustained weight loss when paired with at least &lt;strong&gt;3,500 brisk steps&lt;/strong&gt; in sessions lasting 10 minutes or more. Participants in one cited study who adopted this routine were able to maintain a &lt;strong&gt;10 percent reduction in body weight&lt;/strong&gt; over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals" class="wp-image-101844" data-lazy-srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-380x257.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-520x352.jpg 520w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg" alt="Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals" class="wp-image-101844" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-380x257.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-520x352.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.acsm.org/read-research/resource-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;strong&gt;225 to 420 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; per week to support weight reduction goals. This translates to approximately &lt;strong&gt;2.5 to 3.5 miles daily&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;6,000 to 9,000 brisk steps&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on stride and pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings show a clear distinction between walking for general wellbeing and walking for targeted weight control, with the latter requiring more time, intensity and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sustained Movement Brings Broader Gains&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Emily Larson advises gradual increases in step count, recommending that individuals walking 3,000 steps a day aim to add 1,000 steps weekly. This type of incremental growth appears more effective than pursuing static step targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend distributing walking throughout the day. Multiple studies confirm that three sessions of 10 to 15 minutes can match the benefits of one continuous 30-minute walk. This structure supports individuals with limited time or those reintroducing activity after a sedentary period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Walking Remains One Of The Simplest Tools For Lifelong Health" class="wp-image-101845" data-lazy-srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-380x253.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-520x347.jpg 520w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg" alt="Walking Remains One Of The Simplest Tools For Lifelong Health" class="wp-image-101845" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-380x253.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/walking-remains-one-of-the-simplest-tools-for-lifelong-health-520x347.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking remains one of the simplest tools for lifelong health. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health also points to the metabolic advantages of &lt;strong&gt;short walks after meals&lt;/strong&gt;. A 2022 study on post-meal walking found that walking for two minutes after eating helped regulate blood glucose more effectively than standing or remaining seated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all health gains require daily activity. One study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt; observed that walking &lt;strong&gt;four miles just once or twice a week&lt;/strong&gt; still produced positive effects on longevity. This is particularly relevant for people with limited mobility or time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revising Walking Targets for Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current fitness apps and trackers continue to promote the 10,000-step standard, yet researchers now call for more individualised benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; reports that walking &lt;strong&gt;4,500 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; lowers the risk of cardiovascular events by up to &lt;strong&gt;77 percent&lt;/strong&gt; in older adults. Gains continued up to about 7,000 to 8,000 steps per day, but additional steps did not produce further significant reductions in risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking has also been linked to lower rates of several chronic health conditions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customised walking routines are also encouraged for people recovering from illness or living with physical limitations. Recommendations include &lt;strong&gt;pool walking&lt;/strong&gt;, use of &lt;strong&gt;mobility aids&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;short assisted walks&lt;/strong&gt; to maintain daily activity without strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mental health benefits are also well documented. UCLA Health references findings from the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2023/pandemic-coping-exercise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; showing that walking for &lt;strong&gt;75 minutes per week&lt;/strong&gt; at a moderate pace reduced depression risk by 18 percent. Increasing the total to 120 minutes lowered the risk by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/7-ways-wearable-technology-can-help-you-reach-your-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wearable devices &lt;/a&gt;remain valuable tools for tracking daily movement, but researchers suggest shifting the focus from absolute step counts to personalised progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ancient Egyptians and Etruscans pioneered orthodontics, using delicate gold wires and catgut to straighten teeth. It’s a tale that has appeared in dentistry textbooks for decades, portraying our ancestors as surprisingly modern in their pursuit of the perfect smile. But when archaeologists and dental historians finally scrutinised the evidence, they discovered that most of it is myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the &lt;a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/54090268e6fc428088e1da114df97ed8"&gt;El-Quatta dental bridge&lt;/a&gt; from Egypt, dating to around 2500BC. The gold wire found with ancient remains wasn’t doing what we thought at all. Rather than pulling teeth into alignment, these wires were stabilising loose teeth or holding replacement ones in place. In other words, they were functioning as prostheses, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11614199/"&gt;not braces&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold bands discovered in Etruscan tombs tell a similar story. They were probably dental splints designed to support teeth loosened by gum disease or injury, not devices for moving teeth into &lt;a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.9783/9781512806830-007/html"&gt;new positions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some rather compelling practical reasons why these ancient devices couldn’t have worked as braces anyway. Tests on Etruscan appliances revealed the gold used was &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-7496-8_5"&gt;97% pure&lt;/a&gt;, and pure gold is remarkably soft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bends and stretches easily without breaking, which makes it useless for orthodontics. Braces work by applying continuous pressure over long periods, requiring metal that’s strong and springy. Pure gold simply can’t manage that. Try to tighten it enough to straighten a tooth and it will deform or snap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the curious matter of who was wearing these gold bands. Many were found with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17269195/"&gt;skeletons of women&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting they might have been status symbols or decorative jewellery rather than medical devices. Tellingly, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27514349/"&gt;none&lt;/a&gt; were discovered in the mouths of children or teenagers – exactly where you’d expect to find them if they were genuine orthodontic appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most fascinating revelation is this: ancient people didn’t have the same dental problems we face today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malocclusion – the crowding and misalignment of teeth that’s so common now – was extremely rare in the past. Studies of Stone Age skulls show almost &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002941654901037"&gt;no crowding&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is down to diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors ate tough, fibrous foods that required serious chewing. All that jaw work developed strong, large jaws perfectly capable of accommodating all their &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2646990/"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern diets, by contrast, are soft and processed, giving our jaws little exercise. The result? Our jaws are often smaller than those of our ancestors, while our teeth remain the same size, leading to the crowding we see today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since crooked teeth were virtually non-existent in antiquity, there was hardly any reason to develop methods for straightening them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Jaws were larger, due to food being tougher to chew on.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-portrait-tribe-leader-wearing-animal-1595983525?trackingId=039ed9ad-f04e-44c9-a234-f31269a4f46f"&gt;Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, ancient people did occasionally attempt simple interventions for dental irregularities. The Romans provide one of the earliest reliable references to actual orthodontic treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a Roman medical writer in the first century AD, &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674993709"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that if a child’s tooth came in crooked, they should gently push it into place with a finger every day until it shifted to the correct position. Although basic, this method is built on the same principle we use today – gentle, continuous pressure can move a tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Roman era, little progress occurred for centuries. By the 18th century, however, interest in straightening teeth had revived, albeit through some rather agonising methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those without access to modern dental tools resorted to wooden &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27514349/"&gt;“swelling wedges”&lt;/a&gt; to create space between overcrowded teeth. A small wedge of wood was inserted between teeth. As saliva was absorbed, the wood expanded, forcing the teeth apart. Crude and excruciating, perhaps, but it represented a step towards understanding that teeth could be repositioned through pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scientific orthodontics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real scientific orthodontics began with French dentist Pierre Fauchard’s work in 1728. Often called the father of modern dentistry, Fauchard published a landmark two-volume book, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910708601004"&gt;The Surgeon Dentist&lt;/a&gt;, containing the first detailed description of treating malocclusions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He developed the “bandeau” – a curved metal strip wrapped around teeth to widen the dental arch. This was the first tool specifically designed to move teeth using controlled force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fauchard also described using threads to support teeth after repositioning. His work marked the crucial shift from ancient myths and painful experiments to a scientific approach that eventually led to modern braces and clear aligners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With advances in dentistry during the 19th and 20th centuries, orthodontics became a specialist field. Metal brackets, archwires, elastics and eventually stainless steel made treatment more predictable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later innovations – ceramic brackets, lingual braces and clear aligners – made the process more discreet. Today, orthodontics employs digital scans, computer models, and 3D printing for remarkably precise treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of ancient people sporting gold and catgut braces is certainly appealing and dramatic, but it doesn’t match the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient civilisations were aware of dental problems and occasionally attempted simple solutions. Yet they had neither the necessity nor the technology to move teeth as we do now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real story of orthodontics doesn’t begin in the ancient world but with the scientific breakthroughs of the 18th century and beyond – a history that’s fascinating enough without the myths.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the research team, back pain is one of the most common health problems in Norway, with 60-80 percent of people experiencing it during their lifetime. In fact, they say, back and neck pain have the highest medical costs and represent an enormous burden to the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Our findings show the importance of finding time to be physically active in order to prevent not only chronic back pain but many other illnesses as well, which will translate into huge savings for society in the long run,” says NTNU Professor Paul Jarle-Mörck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Preventing Back Pain With Small Measures in Daily Life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The causes of chronic lower back pain are complex. It is thought to develop from a combination of various factors, including aging, poor posture, muscle weakness, and psychological stress. Conventional treatments have focused on medication and physical therapy, making it difficult to reliably prevent recurrence. The effectiveness of walking, a simple and low-cost method, has now been demonstrated, which may spark a major change in common sense regarding lower back pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The benefits of walking are not limited to lower back pain. Walking has a wide range of positive effects, which include improving cardiopulmonary function, maintaining bone density, weight management, and improving mental health. This research supports the comprehensive health benefits of walking, not limited to the single symptom of lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Small everyday changes, such as walking more when commuting or shopping, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, can help prevent back pain. Even for those who already suffer from back pain, these can be effective ways to reduce the risk of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Wear shoes, go outside, and walk. This may be the first step toward a future free of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wired.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRjNxQk43b3QyQWNwSDhWSloxN2ZVbmdhY3JtT2NDNFlPS2hIMGtqV3lubWQ2WmJzVlE1NmtNdXlSZGdPOWRwaW03N293V1FNSndjc3dWdmtxWFJJczVSaWxwVE9tdDI0MUoyQWI1Qy15LWxwbGhDczRZZUNBbzloTFpvTU40RVR4andwSGxzMkFIOVZZ</guid></item><item><title>一份芝士汉堡可以减少大约9分钟的生命，研究发现- Audacy</title><link>https://www.audacy.com/krld/news/national/one-cheeseburger-can-shave-about-nine-minutes-off-your-life</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__content"&gt;

          &lt;p data-uri="www.audacy.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjwsa975001g01sdsf2hd68q@published" data-editable="text" class="paragraph paragraph--station"&gt;Eating a cheeseburger and other processed meats is linked to shaving minutes off life expectancy,&lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2021posts/individual-dietary-choices-can-add-or-take-away-minutes-hours-years-of-life.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; according to a new analysis of diet and long-term health outcomes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="www.audacy.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjwsawr2001a357vqxuoqehb@published" data-editable="text" class="paragraph paragraph--station"&gt;Researchers estimate that a single cheeseburger can cost about nine minutes of life, based on its association with chronic disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="www.audacy.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjwsawsx001b357vlf5zhu9l@published" data-editable="text" class="paragraph paragraph--station"&gt;The estimate comes from a University of Michigan study that evaluated thousands of foods by weighing their nutritional value against links to illness and early death. The analysis found processed meats and sugary foods were associated with reduced life expectancy, while fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts were linked to modest gains.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="www.audacy.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjwsaww3001c357vwf34bbms@published" data-editable="text" class="paragraph paragraph--station"&gt;Researchers stressed the findings are not a call to eliminate any single food, but rather to understand overall dietary patterns. Replacing small amounts of processed meat with plant-based options, the study found, could produce meaningful health benefits over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="www.audacy.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjwsax3y001d357vw7rut74e@published" data-editable="text" class="paragraph paragraph--station"&gt;The study adds to a growing body of research tying high consumption of processed meats to heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers, while reinforcing long-standing guidance that balance and moderation matter most. Nutrition experts say the takeaway for consumers is not fear, but informed choice at the grocery store and dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
