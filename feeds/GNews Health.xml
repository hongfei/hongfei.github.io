            The fast-growing measles outbreak in South Carolina is now the largest in the United States since the disease was declared eliminated in this country more than two decades ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxk87q00043b6s5tm6zaeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With 789 cases reported as of Tuesday, the South Carolina outbreak surpassed a massive outbreak in Texas, which reached 762 cases before it ended in August last year. Two children died during the outbreak in Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxk87r00053b6ssqgaimdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina, which first reported cases in October, has added more than 600 cases in 2026 alone. At least 18 people – adults and children – have been hospitalized for complications of measles, the state health department said Tuesday, and no deaths have been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwy1brr00003b6rdwrtk2p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are an additional 557 people in quarantine in South Carolina, meaning they may have been exposed to measles and don’t have immunity to it through vaccination or prior infection. The health department reported exposures at three additional schools Tuesday, on top of existing quarantines among students at 20 others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwwmez800003b6sui0181yu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in North Carolina and Washington have also been linked to the South Carolina outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000b3b6st1b0uvzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000c3b6s48sjsvg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before 2025, there were an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since elimination, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000d3b6sn04kondx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that there have been 416 confirmed measles cases reported in the US so far in 2026, but its update included data up until Thursday, before South Carolina’s latest numbers came in. At least 14 states have reported a confirmed measles case so far this year, and another large outbreak continues to grow along the Arizona-Utah border.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000e3b6sefxjhxrc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The spread of measles over the past year has left the US at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/health/measles-elimination-investigation"&gt;risk of losing elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, which the Pan American Health Organization could decide to revoke when it meets in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000f3b6smuntsyv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC previously &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; measles elimination “a historic public health achievement,” possible in large part because of vaccination.The measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 and the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000g3b6shbfzjgss@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previously, the country’s elimination status was threatened in 2019, amid &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxks2x00093b6siyiki2x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, the federal government’s posture toward measles has changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000l3b6suk3z4dp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former Louisiana surgeon general who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/cdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham"&gt;ended &lt;/a&gt;some &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/cdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham"&gt;vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in his state before &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-principal-deputy-director.html" target="_blank"&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt; his new post late last year, argued last week that ongoing measles transmission from the Texas outbreak, which started in January 2025, has not been proved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000m3b6s5ojaok0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, Abraham said the loss of measles elimination status would “not really” be significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000n3b6s0cpsoc06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders,” Abraham told reporters in a briefing. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000o3b6stl68lg99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Abraham added that “vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles” and said the CDC is “here to help,” but they’re willing to listen to alternatives “for treatment and prevention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000p3b6spk90rb55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the South Carolina outbreak are among children, nearly all of whom were not fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine. Of the 789 cases reported as of Tuesday, more than 700 were not vaccinated or had not received the two recommended MMR doses, the health department said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000q3b6sy3k6rfc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have been encouraging vaccination, including through facilitating mobile health unit vaccination events, to try to contain the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000r3b6slq85frsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak, 90% of students had required immunizations in the 2024-25 school year, among the lowest vaccination rates in the state, according to state &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; – with some schools there reporting much lower rates. Public health experts say a 95% vaccination rate is typically needed to keep measles from spreading in a community because the virus is so contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000s3b6s39ku09t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is widely available at doctors’ offices, pharmacies and health departments, and is free for many families through the Vaccines for Children program or health insurance, State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000t3b6s6ybec8no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As we continue to watch this daily surge in cases, [the Department of Public Health] strongly encourages those who are not protected to take advantage of the opportunity to get protected against unexpected exposures and illnesses now to help us stop this outbreak and to help us protect our communities,” Bell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California San Diego have discovered a path between the brain and the immune system that could potentially lead to new ways to ease heart attacks. They showed that disabling specific parts of that circuit could profoundly improve outcomes in mice with experimentally induced heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The injury almost disappears," says UCSD neuroscientist&lt;a href="https://theaugustinelab.org/" target="_blank"&gt; Vineet Augustine&lt;/a&gt;, who led the new &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01506-5?rss=yes" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appearing Tuesday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may not seem obvious how neuroimmune crosstalk relates to heart disease, links between the nervous and immune systems have captivated researchers for decades. Some researchers have focused on the vagus nerve, a huge bundle of fibers that carries signals between the brain and other organs to control breathing, blood pressure, digestion and other involuntary functions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A key discovery came in 2000 when researchers at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research on Long Island, New York, showed that electrically stimulating the vagus nerve in rats curbed production of an immune protein that drives inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Last July, an implantable&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5272748/vagus-nerve-stimulation-may-tame-autoimmune-diseases" target="_blank"&gt; vagus nerve stimulator&lt;/a&gt; developed by SetPoint Medical — a company co-founded by Dr.&lt;a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md" target="_blank"&gt; Kevin Tracey&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Feinstein Institutes — earned FDA approval as a treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier research had also found striking links between the cardiovascular system and the nervous and immune systems. On the day of the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake, the number of&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199602153340701" target="_blank"&gt; sudden cardiac deaths&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles County rose more than fivefold. Similar spikes occur with high-stakes sporting events. During stressful moments, the heart rate shoots up to protect us.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The brain says, hey, get up and run, you're going to die," says Dr.&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/kalyanam-shivkumar" target="_blank"&gt; Kalyanam Shivkumar&lt;/a&gt;, a UCLA cardiac electrophysiologist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While such fight-or-flight signals help during emergencies, in the long term, they trigger harmful inflammation. "And then the heart swells up. You get arrhythmias and heart failure," says Shivkumar, who's leading an effort to create a&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4974797/the-anatomical-atlas-used-by-doctors-has-a-dark-history-one-man-is-pushing-for-change" target="_blank"&gt; new anatomical atlas&lt;/a&gt; of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current research from UCSD uses state-of-the-art tools from genetics and neuroscience to gain a more precise understanding of how the brain communicates with the heart and its role in heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It shows how the vagus nerve carries signals between the brain and the heart. Augustine says he found that during a heart attack in mice, certain vagal neurons (TRPV1 expressing neurons) "literally wrap around the injury site." His team wondered if blocking communication through those nerve cells could help slow or even prevent heart attacks in the lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It was a bold idea — one that some scientists told Augustine was "unreal" when he spoke about the project in its early stages four or five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiments were technically demanding and required multiple researchers to work long hours together — one performing heart surgery on the mice, another targeting specific cells in the brain, and others taking physiological measurements and conducting echocardiography to image the heart in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Minor errors at any step could have compromised the entire experiment," Saurabh Yadav, a postdoc in Augustine's lab and one of the paper's first authors, said via email. "There were moments when I wondered whether I had taken on too much or if this was simply too big a leap."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came an "incredibly encouraging" moment, Yadav told NPR. The team turned off this small group of TRPV1 nerve cells and saw striking improvements in pumping efficiency and electrical signals associated with heart contraction. And that was just the first victory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The TRPV1 neurons carry signals from the heart to the hypothalamus — a deep-brain structure that regulates body temperature, thirst, hunger and sleep. Other cells in the hypothalamus receive those signals and relay them to a different cluster of nerve cells that project back to the heart and unleash an immune protein that drives inflammation. Blocking any of the three junctures of the heart-brain-immune loop relieved heart attack complications in the mice, the UCSD team reports in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The findings in this paper are quite impressive," says&lt;a href="https://profiles.icahn.mssm.edu/cameron-s-mcalpine" target="_blank"&gt; Cameron McAlpine&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroimmunologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While he and others have long known that heart attacks trigger major changes in the immune and nervous systems, McAlpine says, it's only in the last five or six years that researchers have developed "tools and technologies that allow us to study this at a really deep level" — such as some of the genetic approaches for precisely manipulating the activity in specific groups of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, research in this area stalled because of a conceptual divide — the idea that the brain is the command center, sending signals to the rest of the body, Augustine says. Clinicians "focused on the organ itself, whereas the nervous system was kind of ignored," he adds. "That created a lot of silos." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, interest in the nervous and immune systems is surging. These systems "affect practically everything in your body," he says. "The field is really exploding."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the mouse findings are still years from entering human trials, it's possible that the approved vagus nerve stimulator could prove useful for heart attacks after further study, says &lt;a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/rollsasya" target="_blank"&gt;Asya Rolls&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroimmunologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Her team has shown that the&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-024-00491-3" target="_blank"&gt; brain's reward networks&lt;/a&gt; can regulate inflammation in mice in various settings including bacterial infections and cancer as well as heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In future experiments, Augustine says his team will flesh out the heart-brain-immune circuit by investigating, for example, what exactly the nerve cells are sensing and how they communicate with the heart cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a 2024 paper, McAlpine and colleagues report that heart attacks send immune cells into the brain to&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08100-w" target="_blank"&gt; promote deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The growing body of research illustrates how brain-immune connections can manifest differently across conditions — and "it's likely much more complex" than the specific pathways identified by each research team, Rolls told NPR via email. Each manipulation likely affects many other pathways such as blood flow, vascularization and metabolism. A National Institutes of Health program called&lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities/SPARC" target="_blank"&gt; Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC&lt;/a&gt;) is funding research on stimulating neural circuits to relieve disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Shivkumar sees an emerging theme. "The message people should get is, oh my God, these scientists are doing something very exciting. But literally we are building on ancient knowledge," he says. Research on stimulating the vagus nerve supports "what the Buddha said: meditate. I call it Zen cardiology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Mainstream doctors aren’t backing down from a fight with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The American Academy of Pediatrics has just released its own recommendations for which vaccines children and teens should receive—with some notable differences from the version recently tabled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; its childhood vaccine schedule on Monday, with the endorsement of 12 other medical organizations and groups, including the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. The recommendations are in line with the AAP’s prior guidance but contain several vaccines no longer universally recommended by RFK Jr.’s CDC, including the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” said AAP President Andrew Racine in a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the organization. “Routine childhood immunizations are an important early step in the path to lifelong health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tried and tested&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, RFK Jr. and the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-rfk-jr-are-officially-tearing-down-the-childhood-vaccine-schedule-2000705661"&gt;abruptly removed&lt;/a&gt; several vaccines from the recommended childhood vaccination schedule—a longstanding goal of the anti-vaccination movement. The CDC now only endorses childhood vaccines for 11 diseases, down from the 18 diseases previously recommended by the health agency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes supposedly align the U.S. with other peer countries, federal officials have said, but the new schedule actually only copies that of Denmark—which vaccinates against 10 diseases—with one addition, chickenpox. Those left on the cutting room floor included hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, RSV, flu, and meningococcal disease. The CDC had previously removed the covid-19 vaccine from its routine schedule last year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time lambasted the changes and the rationale behind them. Many countries recommend more childhood vaccines than Denmark does, including Canada, Japan, and Germany. Denmark’s schedule is also influenced by factors specific to the country and not the U.S., such as a universal health care system that better screens for diseases like hepatitis B. Vaccines for these diseases are now only recommended for high-risk groups or as part of a “shared clinical decision-making” process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, there is no solid evidence that the timing and amount of vaccines previously recommended by the CDC posed any added risk to children’s health. And studies have continuously rebuffed antivaxxers’ &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; made about specific routine vaccines, such as a supposed link between autism and the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine (still on the current schedule).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s schedule covers the same diseases previously recommended by the CDC. It also maintains a recommendation for children to get two doses of the HPV vaccine starting as early as ages 9 to 12, as opposed to the CDC’s new recommendation of one dose at age 11 or 12 (while some research has suggested one dose can provide effective protection, this strategy is still being evaluated, the AAP said).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AAP recommends immunizations that have been designed to teach the immune system to recognize and resist serious diseases,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a statement. “They are carefully tested and monitored over time. The pacing and combination of vaccines are based on what we know about when your child’s immune system is ready to learn and respond best.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The growing resistance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s new schedule is the most recent sign that doctors and local health officials won’t easily go along with RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While states have long relied on the CDC’s guidance to shape their vaccine policy, for instance, numerous state health departments have formed their own coalitions during the second Trump term and have &lt;a href="https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-10_hepatitis_b_votes.htm"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that they will not carry out the changes endorsed by RFK Jr.’s CDC. The AAP and other organizations have also &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682/Updated-AAP-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-ACIP-members?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; lawsuits against the Trump administration for past abrupt shifts to its vaccine policy and are now &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34241"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; the latest changes in court, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For the time being, though, it appears that RFK Jr. and his allies will continue to push the envelope in their agenda against vaccines. Over the weekend, Kirk Miloan, chair of the CDC’s advisory vaccine committee—a panel unilaterally reshaped by RFK Jr. last year—&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/chair-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-questions-polio-shot/story?id=129580522"&gt;questioned &lt;/a&gt;whether Americans still needed vaccines for polio and measles. Notably, the U.S. is in the midst of a measles resurgence, one that might soon cause the country to lose its official measles-free status.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But in certain corners of Instagram and TikTok, women are convinced it really starts much earlier. Now, in addition to the 40 weeks your body is actively growing a fetus, you also have to worry about “trimester zero” — the months before you even start trying to conceive.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In this world, the ideal woman can’t get enough organ meat and takes double the daily recommendation of choline to boost her future baby’s IQ.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She orders her own ferritin tests online so she can see if her iron levels are holding strong at 70 ng/mL or dipping below 50 ng/mL.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She has no need for an alarm clock or caffeine, since she wears blue-light blockers after dark and wakes naturally with the sunrise. The air she breathes is filtered and unpolluted by artificial fragrance. Her kitchen is free of plastic and bleach. Physically, she’s the strongest she’s ever been, because she knows that for the next nine months, her body will be running the equivalent of a marathon every day.&lt;/p&gt;

But increasingly, it feels like the goal post has been moved back. On her podcast, &lt;em&gt;Culture Apothecary&lt;/em&gt;, MAHA influencer Alex Clark &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ7ru_5EuRN/"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; women thinking about getting pregnant soon stop wearing nail polish, while holistic nutritionists say it’s important &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPmWlMzEglq/?hl=en"&gt;to avoid drinking iced beverages&lt;/a&gt;. Influencers are &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS7xY7zDU-I/?hl=en"&gt;chronicling their meditation journeys&lt;/a&gt; to lower cortisol six months before trying to conceive, while others are &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG4KiB2O-lo/?hl=en"&gt;ordering direct-to-consumer micronutrient labs&lt;/a&gt; and embarking on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHlSeiHR1Ee/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=6"&gt;60-day pregnancy-prep detoxes&lt;/a&gt;. While the recommendations are all over the map, the message is clear: What you’re doing now could be putting your future child at a disadvantage — even if you’re not pregnant yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrouh00263b7a6mjy1z4n@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;I heard from a woman who eats liver every week (it tastes gross, but she read that it’s full of B vitamins) and another who got a stool analysis done to assess her gut health. A dietitian who specializes in fertility says women are coming to her for advice on how to optimize their microbiome before passing it on to their babies.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One mother told me she became fixated on her blood sugar and worried that spikes would increase her risk of miscarriage. She started using a glucometer and stopped drinking orange juice and eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

For the toxins that cannot be avoided, she suggests you start taking &lt;a href="https://shop.annshippymd.com/collections/all-products/products/zeo-bind"&gt;her line of detox supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which she says can help remove heavy metals from your system before you pass them on to your baby via breastmilk.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet some claims about the importance of trimester zero strain credulity. According to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDV-rfJuyD/"&gt;Alexandra Radway&lt;/a&gt;, who coaches women on how to prepare their bodies for conception, the women who follow her protocol have pregnancies unburdened by the inconveniences of morning sickness, fatigue, or back pain. Shippy, a functional medicine practitioner, tells me that women have been misled to believe that their fertility declines after age 35. With the right supplements and a “super-clean diet” (i.e., no gluten or dairy), she claims women can easily get pregnant well into their 40s and feel great, “because their bodies are so ready.” For women who are truly healthy, IVF is “very rarely” necessary, she says. Listening to them talk, it’s easy to come away thinking that if you struggle to get pregnant or have a difficult pregnancy, it’s your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

But the doctors I spoke to said the things that actually make a difference are far more basic. You should take &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/folate-vs-folic-acid-prenatal-vitamins.html"&gt;a prenatal with folic acid&lt;/a&gt; and avoid smoking and drug use. You should also make sure any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes, are under control, and get up to date with vaccines and STI testing. Most of these are things doctors would recommend to everyone, not just women planning to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter what fancy &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mandymooremm/videos/850166884187166/"&gt;prenatal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://thisisneeded.com/products/egg-quality-support?delivery-schedule=monthly&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=18300978467&amp;amp;utm_term=18300978467%7C%7C&amp;amp;nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A18300978467%3A%3A&amp;amp;nb_adtype=pla&amp;amp;nb_kwd=&amp;amp;nb_ti=&amp;amp;nb_mi=164791643&amp;amp;nb_pc=online&amp;amp;nb_pi=47045685838069&amp;amp;nb_ppi=&amp;amp;nb_placement=&amp;amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;amp;nb_lp_ms=&amp;amp;nb_fii=&amp;amp;nb_ap=&amp;amp;nb_mt=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=17415527961&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACtRsSjqqwgcL8T69TLJW8sj10mjH&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvtzLBhCPARIsALwhxdpJVaM8mnjLyhqsgXEzif1eyK7VbyY3Qc5Du1lXFMzsWCp23-DFP9gaAiSnEALw_wcB&amp;amp;variant=47045685838069"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; try to tell you, there’s no magical solution that will stop your eggs and ovaries from aging, says Katherine VanHise, an OB/GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility Beverly Hills. And sure, some women have no problem getting pregnant in their mid-40s — but that probably has more to do with genetics than with their diet.&lt;/p&gt;

Growing a baby inside your body requires a certain level of blind faith. Of course it’s comforting, and human, to fixate on the choices we do have.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also hard to ignore that the rulebook for how to have a healthy pregnancy is expanding at the same time that access to maternal health care is being decimated. The Trump administration has gutted the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, stopped collecting &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/the-pregnancy-dataset-we-cant-afford-to-lose/"&gt;crucial data on pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, and slashed funding for Medicaid, which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/nyregion/doulas-childbirth-medicaid.html"&gt;many women rely on for prenatal care&lt;/a&gt;, while simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/trump-rfk-jr-tylenol-autism-explained.html"&gt;urging pregnant women to “tough it out” and avoid Tylenol&lt;/a&gt; against the advice of leading medical associations. Dr. Oz recently applauded the fact that, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjessicaknurick/video/7597608143023082782"&gt;facing a severe shortage of OB/GYNs&lt;/a&gt;, Alabama is now using robots to perform ultrasounds on pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp7a002c3b7ajdh7f76a@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5101902/35-of-u-s-counties-dont-have-an-adequate-place-in-which-to-give-birth-report-finds"&gt;prenatal care becomes a luxury,&lt;/a&gt; maternal and infant health is increasingly presented as a matter of personal responsibility, with choices as basic as what to have for breakfast framed as high stakes. The noise only gets louder once you’re actually pregnant. According to Jessie Inchauspé, a.k.a. the Glucose Goddess, pregnant women should think twice before eating that bagel. Her new book, &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/9-months-that-count-forever?srsltid=AfmBOoqYtklQeeAYKevQdghQ1wBxaQk8ty-c9nN8lPf6kYCIu48qJMBy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Months That Count Forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, warns that overdoing it on sugar and refined grains can put your baby at risk for all sorts of health complications, including diabetes, obesity, ADHD, and autism. (OBs say that while prenatal nutrition is important, your baby’s future health &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTyJ8pCDSPf/"&gt;is impacted by far more&lt;/a&gt; than the number of cookies you eat while pregnant.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrpfu002d3b7aido4ylrn@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;Nervous about her chances of getting pregnant at 37, one mother told me she went on an “insane, anxiety-fueled health kick” before trying to conceive. She did acupuncture, stopped wearing perfume, swapped out her scented soap, and ate as many goji berries as she could stand. While ovulating, she took Mucinex to thin her cervical mucus. “I stopped working out with a trainer, because I’d read that if you worked out too hard, the egg wouldn’t implant.” She got pregnant after a few months of trying. Yet despite eating “the cleanest I’d ever eaten,” she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She knew it was most likely genetic; diabetes runs in her family. Still, she felt guilty and worried her baby was going to have blood-sugar issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrphw002e3b7ab05wlo97@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;“It just feels like there’s this responsibility on mothers that starts even before you’re pregnant, like, if you don’t do all these things perfectly, then you’re being irresponsible with your future child.” Now, when she takes her 2-month-old to the pediatrician and fills out the postpartum-depression assessment, she always pauses on the question: “Have you blamed yourself unnecessarily?” “I think that’s really hard to answer as a mother, when all the messaging is, ‘You need to do this and this,’” she told me on a phone call while she pumped. These days, her feeds are full of advice on everything she should eat while breastfeeding to ensure her baby is getting all the optimal nutrients. “It feels like it never ends.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvor47f002x27qc1l3i781j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Terry Sigmond thought it was a cold. She even tried to get out of a New Year’s celebration, but her friend encouraged her to go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvrpwv8004h3b6shanrz9bw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So began her weeks-long flu ordeal, when she dozed to Hallmark Channel movies and swapped bed-rest photos with the same friend she rang in 2026 with.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvrvofg004j3b6siul0qq4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have all these pictures together, and we’re smiling,” Sigmond said. After flu, “we send pictures to each other with tissues stuffed up our noses to catch all the dripping snot.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp600033b6soo0ze36b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just laid in bed for days. We have one of those Sleep Number beds that you can crank up the heat on, and I think my husband thought he was in a sauna,” said Sigmond, 64, who said she’s usually a healthy and energetic marketing manager for a home care company in Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700053b6slhmnf7ti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sigmond and her friend are far from alone. A brutal flu season is hitting across the country, sending record levels of people to the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0uqz002s3b6sn2x7ab94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the most recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, dozens of cities, states or territories in the US show moderate to very high flu activity, but there are signs the season is coming down off its winter peak. Overall, the CDC estimates that there have been 19 million illnesses, 250 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths this season — most of them caused by a new strain called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/13/health/flu-season-subclade-k-variant"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700073b6skca25jks@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When CNN asked for your flu stories, we received hundreds of written responses from people like Sigmond and Jillian Luis, a 36-year-old from the Seattle area who said her family was sick for weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700083b6supg69enj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We just were kind of out of it for a whole month,” she said between coughs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700093b6szpq7durt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It started with her 3-year-old, then her 6-year-old. Somehow her husband avoided it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp7000a3b6s6osqku2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m glad somebody’s healthy, but man, it’s annoying,” Luis joked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvor6xy00003b6swit0guo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Luis is one of many who wrote to CNN who described the strain of juggling their regular responsibilities with a miserable illness. The one silver lining, Luis said, is that her 3-year-old became so resourceful, she figured out how to break into the sandwich bread and beef sticks. How does she know? Luis found the too-chewy beef bits in the kitchen and pieces of bread with holes nibbled out of them, “like we had a mouse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvot1l3000h3b6sj3ghmv5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next challenge, Luis said, is dialing back all the extra PBS Kids they’ve been watching. “Trying to get back into a routine and limit screen time again, now that will be the battle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoskp4000e3b6sngwuybxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people said they could see how conveniences developed during the Covid-19 pandemic made the flu manageable this year. But there are only so many food deliveries, off-camera Zoom meetings and TV binges to take advantage of when they’re the sickest they’ve ever felt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvrkqay004e3b6svo8nhm8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how they managed so far during this record-breaking flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoti9k000k3b6sevyz9rcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lindsay Nelmes says she barely remembers New Year’s — and it wasn’t for fun reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000r3b6sh5v1nzr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 43-year-old Florida mother of two describes her family as “normally pretty healthy,” but after traveling to Chicago for the holidays, all of them — including her husband and their two middle-schoolers — caught the flu and developed the same symptoms: dizziness, chills, terrible fatigue and big-time brain fog.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000s3b6s4373lfg6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The family spent much of the first week of 2026 in bed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000t3b6szfvbp77e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We just dropped like flies,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000u3b6s8o2do2ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With everyone being sick, Nelmes says, her kids would come into her bedroom with their iPads and headphones and ask for medicine about every four hours. When they bounced back quicker than the adults, there was a two-day stretch in which she thinks she ordered Instacart or DoorDash six times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000v3b6ssoo5uh8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m going to regret looking at my bank statement,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000w3b6sej51w7nx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu wiped Nelmes out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000x3b6serfz2nie@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My husband and I, it was literally three or four days of just sleeping, not getting up, chugging Gatorade, not eating. It was bad,” Nelmes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000y3b6s0sp9i4mw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nelmes has regrets. She was so tired, she couldn’t really follow her sister’s advice to binge-watch “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/entertainment/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-hockey"&gt;Heated Rivalry&lt;/a&gt;.” (The show streams on HBO, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) Even steamy sex scenes between rival hockey players couldn’t hold her attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000z3b6sjjfgzv81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would turn it on and just fall asleep,” she said, and still “wake up completely exhausted.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovl41000p3b6sbw15dzut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sylvia Baer said she and her husband got flu shots this year, and they know that if they hadn’t, they’d be in the hospital — or worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk00173b6s79bjf2ei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’ve been married 43 years and are hardly ever apart, so one recent morning, she noticed a subtle change in his voice. He confessed to a cough but “tends to push stuff away,” said Baer, 75. He left to play golf.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk00183b6s5cfxo4b1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suspecting that he was sick, she immediately ordered ingredients to make chicken soup – but before she could even fire up the stove, he came home. He said he felt so bad, he’d left his game early.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk00193b6sglpqi881@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now, this has never happened in the history of the universe,” Baer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001a3b6s7q36mriz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her husband slept for two days, “miserable and coughing.” Believing that the vaccine would protect her, she felt she could care for him without getting sick. “You know that hope that you cling on?” But soon, she felt a telling ache in her shoulders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001b3b6svmm0249y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re both academics, so we like to be in charge of our minds. We have multiple degrees between us, but whoo, this virus is so much smarter than we are,” Baer said. She had a fever and a cough, she said, and has never felt so tired.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001d3b6sgbs1k9pg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And there was pain in places I didn’t even know I had,” Baer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001e3b6swpqx517x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hardest thing for Baer has been needing to sleep so much. Though they’re retired, the snowbirds divide their time between Florida and New Jersey and are not the types to lie around. Baer said they play tennis regularly; &lt;a href="https://davenport.yale.edu/profile/sylvia-baer" target="_blank"&gt;they’re Davenport Fellows&lt;/a&gt; at Yale; she’s &lt;a href="https://www.sylviabaer.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;the poet laureate of Cape May&lt;/a&gt;. She writes plays and poems and both teach workshops. When they’re back in New Jersey, they keep a &lt;a href="https://www.sylviabaer.com/poet-tree" target="_blank"&gt;Poet-Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a tree covered in brightly colored poems they constantly resupply so people can take one right from the lawn.

            But sick with the flu, a professor who taught literature for 50 years said she couldn’t write or read anything.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001g3b6sgez0bv2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I felt better, I would be sad about it, but I don’t even feel well enough to be sad,” Baer said. “I have planted my flag deeply into the land of bitter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Benjamin Brooker, a 40-year-old father of two who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, area, said he got sick after a family New Year’s weekend stay at a hotel in southwestern Virginia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001n3b6sevhrly89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His 7-year-old had it first, but his symptoms got better between breakfast and bedtime. The boy and his older brother had been vaccinated in October, but time got away from Brooker and his wife, Lauren, and they didn’t get the flu shot like they usually did – and he paid for it, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001o3b6snt6dzg9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first, Brooker thought he had food poisoning and called off work. He felt well enough that he ran errands and got one son to the orthodontist, but when he got back home, his wife noticed something was “still a little off” and reminded him that it was his responsibility to get it checked out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001p3b6si2karndl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next day, urgent care confirmed that he had the flu. Brooker said he thinks his wife immediately went to get her flu shot and a prescription for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/26/health/flu-treatment-tamiflu-xofluza-relenza-rapivab"&gt;antiviral Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;. She avoided getting sick – which he said is fortunate, since she took over all the family duties, including caring for their two cats and three dogs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001q3b6sgvvx9mp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She’s a saint,” Brooker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001r3b6sop466elj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He took &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/26/health/flu-treatment-tamiflu-xofluza-relenza-rapivab"&gt;Xofluza, the single-dose antiviral&lt;/a&gt;, but was still “completely bedridden for four days.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001s3b6sgdvko8ub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brooker isolated himself from the family; the few times they had to interact, he wore a mask and wiped everything he touched with Clorox wipes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001t3b6sjjqcyq7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’d remind me, ‘did you wash your hands? Did you Clorox the doorknob and the light switch?’ ” he said of his family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001u3b6snjombboy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He missed three days of work and only felt up to small tasks by day five. It took more than a half-hour to write two emails.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001v3b6sqje2x7ma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brooker, the assistant coach of one son’s hockey team, felt like he’d been getting better every day but still wasn’t 100% by the weekend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001w3b6sbxgqf5pr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Normally, I’m pretty animated, but I just wasn’t. By the end of the day, it had just completely taken it out of me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvownqe001l3b6ssqksbghe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Linda Hyatt, a veterinarian in the Chicago suburbs, said she coughed so hard from the flu that she cracked a rib.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00233b6scq5qa8dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not something I had on my pregnancy bingo card,” said Hyatt, who was sick late in her pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00243b6sw4alatan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 40-year-old says there were many things she and her husband wanted to finish before her scheduled Cesarean section, but they were out of time. “We’re just triaging and doing the things that are the most necessary,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00253b6s0of8r5tj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her young son got sick first, but it was mild, with a “tiny fever and maybe a little bit of a snotty nose.” All of them got their flu shots this year. Hyatt figured it was just a cold, but when a fever of 100 kept coming back, he tested positive for the flu at a pediatric urgent care. He got Tamiflu and seemed better, and her husband didn’t get sick at all. Hyatt, though, became “totally incapacitated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00263b6swt87ly85@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being so big and pregnant and coughing so much and being so tired and everything, I really had to rely on my husband to care for our 2-year-old. He’s such an active, active boy,” Hyatt said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00273b6sl5e5iko8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overly optimistic, Hyatt thought she’d get better quickly and says she bought a ton of food for a delayed Christmas celebration. But even days after the holiday, she wasn’t up to it, and when they finally celebrated later, “I asked to open gifts in my pajamas.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00283b6syiu6emk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When she went back to work, she wore a mask, which prompted several of her patients’ humans to tell her about their own terrible bouts with the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00293b6stzs0jxm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One silver lining: With so much flu, she said, it should boost her infant’s immunity through the rest of the flu season, which runs through May.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n002a3b6srxu4p8dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hopefully, this means that this baby will have protection,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyame00213b6sqb7c3qpa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rebecca Hernandez, a 46-year-old mother of two who works at a lab in Michigan, said she’s grateful that a recent promotion lets her work from home sometimes. It hasn’t been easy working through the flu, but “you just have to keep going.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002h3b6s8r0gmpp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She spent a couple days at home and went back to the lab, but she came home exhausted and had to nap. “It has been rough.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002i3b6s7409rvr3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her 10-year-old son was polite enough to wait for her to wake up before asking her to make pancakes, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002j3b6sti8jkvvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hernandez’s husband, who did not get sick, took over most of the cooking, or she’s just told her kids to grab what they want from the pantry. That worked with her 15-year-old, but her younger child didn’t always eat when it was lunch or dinnertime.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvplybe003a3b6s1q90xosh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Suddenly I’d see all these wrappers around the living room and think to myself ‘oh, God, he got into that,’ but I let it go,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002k3b6sbgc2ueet@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s also had to let go of her kids’ strict sleep schedule. She didn’t have the energy to keep up with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002l3b6sr0ipityt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My husband’s more of a night owl,” she said, so he’s managing the children’s bedtimes for now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002m3b6s1btew93j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hernandez says her big takeaway is to make sure she gets a flu shot from now on. Her entire family gets vaccinated every year, but she got busy this year and forgot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002n3b6sssllvbq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a reminder that I have to make time for myself and get the shot.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002u3b6s0659dk49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Brad Young came down with a sore throat, aches and a fever, followed by stomach bloating and brain fog, he had to keep his wits about him: He still had to work and solo parent a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old over the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002v3b6sk1ck0b2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m very blessed with their temperament, because they knew Daddy was not feeling well, and they were able to give me the space I needed,” said Young, a 37-year-old director at a tech company in Tucson, Arizona. “It helped that they had free rein of TV and YouTube and Disney+, and they definitely took advantage of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002w3b6sw1stav65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Young said breaking his “cardinal rule” helped, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002x3b6sqho5j0t6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I never order meal service deliveries. I always think it’s just a total waste, but now we kind of see the value in meal delivery services,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002y3b6st46ppl8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This had been the longest he’s been sick, Young said. He was glad to work remotely, even though it was tough. After a long stretch with kids out of school over the holidays, he was eager to use his brain and talk to adults, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e00303b6svobmfdj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu also taught some valuable lessons. He usually keeps busy exercising and working on several projects at once, but the flu forced him to slow down. It’s been a “good exercise in patience and being in the moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e00313b6sfkbum4ab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another benefit, of sorts, was his total lack of an appetite. He didn’t even want coffee, and “alcohol is the last thing I want to do right now.” It made things easy to stick to dry January and everyone’s favorite New Years resolution, losing weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e00323b6sw3sr5nv6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m kicking off the New Year strong.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                Injectable GLP-1 drugs have been a game-changer for many people with obesity. But as researchers discover why the medicines fail for others, they are gaining insights about the complexity of the condition.

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Obesity shaped Anna Olson's earliest notions of herself, when she saw a photo and thought, "Oh, I look different than the other kids."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Olson's obesity began in toddlerhood, ran in her family, and left her with a chronic hunger hard to satiate. Dozens of diet, drug and exercise regimens didn't work, and advice from doctors was always the same: Eat less. "And I'm kind of like, 'Well, it's what I'm doing now. What else can I do?'" she says, and the response, again, was: "Well, you just got to eat less."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, science now shows obesity is far more complex — with numerous genetic, biological, neurological, lifestyle, metabolic and behavioral factors contributing to it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Root causes vary&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors, patients and drug companies have learned a lot more in recent years about obesity and what works — or doesn't — since the new class of obesity treatments known as GLP-1 drugs have come to market. Although obesity manifests one way — excess weight — doctors say there are perhaps dozens of different forms of it. For treatment to work, therefore, root causes must be identified, then addressed, for each person. Obesity doctors and researchers say within several years, they expect treatment will be more customized to meet the needs of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Olson, genetic testing indicated she likely has several genetic and hormonal factors setting her hunger and satiety sensors out of whack. One of the GLP-1 drugs — Ozempic — worked briefly, but it turned out another, Zepbound, better recalibrated Olson's hormone imbalance. It was only when she started tackling her specific obesity drivers&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Olson began losing lots of weight — 65 pounds to date, as she remains on the medicine. "I've been able to keep it off," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Popular drugs a precursor to precision medicine?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Use of GLP-1 drugs is already huge and is set to become even more common, as the medicines become cheaper, with more variations, including the recently launched&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;easier-to-use Wegovy pill from Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy are the brand names for a drug called semaglutide. Zepbound and Mounjaro are the brands of a drug called tirzepatide. Both are &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/tirzepatide-semaglutide-how-compare-3576410/" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1 agonists, and tirzepatide blocks&lt;/a&gt; an additional hormone, known as GIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Within a few years, doctors say, there also will be more ways to determine an individual's specific obesity factors, which will enable a more precise targeting of the root causes of their obesity, similar to how chemotherapies can target specific cancer subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The complex makeup of obesity might also explain why GLP-1s don't work for many people. A sizable minority &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/glp-1-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-side-effects-ozempic-face-and-more" target="_blank"&gt;experience side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11751938/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown a significant portion of patients lose less than 5% of their body weight on the drug, though they may experience other metabolic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Obesity subtypes &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are many types of obesity, and each type of obesity has a unique genetic predisposition," says &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20189108" target="_blank"&gt;Andres Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at the Mayo Clinic. Acosta says early research indicates genetic markers might be measured to predict, for example, whether a person might not respond well to GLP-1 medicines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Acosta is also co-founder of Phenomix Sciences, a company selling genetic testing through some doctors' offices; the testing is &lt;a href="https://www.myphenometest.com/faqs" target="_blank"&gt;not covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cheek-swab genetic test groups people into four basic obesity &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Phenotype" target="_blank"&gt;phenotypes&lt;/a&gt; (meaning observable traits): Hungry Gut, Hungry Brain, Emotional Hunger, and Slow Burn. (A person might belong to more than one of these groups.) Each category has different hormonal or lifestyle factors that drive obesity. For example, someone with emotionally driven eating habits might not benefit as much from GLP-1 drugs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acosta says also, those with abnormalities in their gut hormones tend to lose more weight on GLP-1 medicines, while some people with "Hungry Brain" genetic markers may have a broken neural pathway that prevents the drug from being as effective for that group. For those people, Acosta says, often earlier generations of weight-loss medicines — or a combination of new and old drugs — work best.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A workable treatment plan&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anna Olson says this kind of personalization was key. Through genetic testing, she found out her phenotype is "Hungry Brain." She also found out she has &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bardet-biedl-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20586227#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20learning%2C%20thinking%20and%20memory." target="_blank"&gt;Bardet-Biedl syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disorder that predisposes her to eat too much. Knowing that, she says, reduced her sense of stigma and helped her find the most fitting combination of medications for her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now 36, she says her cholesterol and blood sugar levels have improved, and she's closer to her dream of traveling further afield from her native Minneapolis. "When I was more overweight than now, there was absolutely no way that I could do that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More precise diagnosis of specific forms of obesity is still a few years off, says &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/resources/speakers-bureau/lydia-alexander-md-foma/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lydia Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, past president of the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TM_BR_SummerDiscountExtension25" target="_blank"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;. But researchers are getting closer to understanding the variables that make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The chemistry of a person's gut microbiome, their proclivity toward addiction, or the molecular shape of their hormone receptors can all affect the drug's efficacy, she says. "The medication might be degraded faster in one individual than in another," she says, which might also explain the different responses to GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Alexander says that in all instances, adaptations in lifestyle are critical for a full and lasting response. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-085304" target="_blank"&gt;a recent review of 37 studies on weight loss&lt;/a&gt; showed that those who rely on GLP-1 drugs tend to gain back the weight at a faster rate when they stop treatment, as compared to those who rely on behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A 50-50 chance of success&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of the downsides of &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;popularized GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; is that they have raised people's expectations for rapid weight loss, says &lt;a href="https://popcenter.harvard.edu/blog/directory/jennifer-manne-goehler/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Manne-Goehler&lt;/a&gt;, a Harvard metabolic disease specialist. She says &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11404059/#:~:text=3.1.,-2.&amp;amp;text=Similarly%2C%20a%20greater%20proportion%20of,14%2C23%2C24%5D." target="_blank"&gt;roughly half of those who take GLP-1 drugs lose 15%&lt;/a&gt; or more of their weight, and "because the potential of those drugs is so incredible for that half, everyone who takes them thinks they're going to be in the half that have that experience."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Manne-Goehler says what's often forgotten is that obesity is a chronic, lifelong condition. "One tool does not work for each person, and one tool often is not enough over the lifetime of a person to control or to mitigate the health impact of that condition," she says. But over the next few years, she says, at least there will be more tools to better target treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Possible risk of autism in children. Dormant cancer cells awakening. Accelerating aging of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials in May 2023 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashish-jha-on-winding-down-the-covid-19-pandemic-emergency/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;declared an end&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/end-of-phe.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;national COVID pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. But more than two years later, a growing body of research continues to reveal information about the virus and its ability to cause harm long after initial infections resolve, even in some cases when symptoms were mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries raise fresh concerns about the Trump administration's COVID policies, researchers say. While some studies show COVID vaccines offer protective benefits against longer-term health effects, the Department of Health and Human Services has drastically limited recommendations about who should get the shot. The administration also &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/slashing-of-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-development-raises-concern/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;halted Biden-era contracts&lt;/a&gt; aimed at developing more protective COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government is curtailing such efforts just as researchers call for more funding and, in some cases, long-term monitoring of people previously infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People forget, but the legacy of COVID is going to be long, and we are going to be learning about the chronic effects of the virus for some time to come," said &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration said that the COVID vaccine &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendations-covid-chickenpox/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;remains available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that individuals are encouraged to talk with their health providers about what is best for them. The COVID vaccine and others on the schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain covered by insurance so that individuals don't need to pay out-of-pocket, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Updating CDC guidance and expanding shared clinical decision-making restores informed consent, centers parents and clinicians, and discourages 'one size fits all' policies," said HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although COVID has become less deadly, because of population immunization and mutations making the virus less severe, researchers say the politicization around the infection is obscuring what science is increasingly confirming: COVID's potential to cause unexpected, possibly chronic health issues. That in turn, these scientists say, drives the need for more, rather than less, research, because over the long term, COVID could have significant economic and societal implications, such as higher health care costs and more demands on social programs and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual average burden of the disease's long-term health effects is estimated at $1 trillion globally and $9,000 per patient in the U.S., according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639003/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report published&lt;/a&gt; in November in the journal NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine. In this country, the annual lost earnings are estimated to be about $170 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study estimates that the flu resulted in $16 billion in direct health costs and $13 billion in productivity losses in the 2023-2024 season, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.23.25342685v1.full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a Dec. 30 report in MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, an online platform that publishes work not yet certified by peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID's growing reach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much has been learned about COVID since the virus emerged in 2019, unleashing a pandemic that the World Health Organization reports has killed more than &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;7 million people&lt;/a&gt;. By the spring of 2020, the term "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/long-covid-what-scientists-now-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" had been coined to describe &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/long-covid-symptoms-nih-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that can persist post-infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that infection by the virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, can result in heightened health risks months to more than a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers following children born to mothers who contracted the virus while pregnant have discovered they may have an &lt;a href="https://secure-web.cisco.com/1NW5qPcwDHtYq61Mh4p5FWNgu1mmUrB2QAYq-vhqRRNn-7MGYPEsQpWsbC0267LhmpL11F1aSkZrWcUmZ05pN4ixHjN9V7uCeRRNTszAPHxW6026yC8Apd5C3NcumnwuMjt8W_6ivt2HY9z_a0pLasE3RVGL3i8kehntfPZEP7n34rKa8JVf9Fo7dKuuL1ROHaJ3fIW-Lbg_3ps-fWTr2Gtetq2155Fy_pRZHQjBpUN9H-CusODm3NUIpY8m9j4SRJ0AO1gOAet9cDKSnF1cTloVo7F-crOKu5jKZQn9FAhwCneHu2Ersf297fC9ogaoiUwLZDd8u-40CyqUNTG_hLA/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cidrap.umn.edu%2Fcovid-19%2Fkids-exposed-covid-utero-may-be-higher-risk-autism-other-brain-problems" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;increased risk for autism&lt;/a&gt;, delayed speech and motor development, or other neurodevelopmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38351665/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found babies exposed to COVID in utero experienced accelerated weight gain in their first year, a possible harbinger of metabolic issues that could later carry an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies suggest avoiding severe COVID in pregnancy may reduce risk not just during pregnancy but for future generations. That may be another good reason to get vaccinated when pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other body symptoms apart from the developing fetal brain that also may be impacted," said Andrea Edlow, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School who was involved in both studies. "We definitely need more research."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists point to some specific, emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;U.K. study&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine found people who &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/even-fully-recovered-survivors-mild-covid-can-lose-iq-points-study-suggests#:~:text=Mild%20cognitive%20decline%20was%20noted,recovered%20from%20mild%20COVID%2D19." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fully recovered&lt;/a&gt; from mild COVID infections experienced a cognitive deficit equal to a three-point drop in IQ. Among the more than 100,000 participants, deficits were greater in people who had persistent symptoms and reached the equivalent of a nine-point IQ drop for individuals admitted to intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.va.gov/132887/dr-ziyad-al-aly-recognition-long-covid-research/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ziyad Al-Aly&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical epidemiologist who has studied longer-term health effects from COVID, did the math. He estimated COVID may have increased the number of adults in the U.S. with an IQ of less than 70 from 4.7 million to 7.5 million — &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-leaves-its-mark-on-the-brain-significant-drops-in-iq-scores-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a jump of 2.8 million adults&lt;/a&gt; dealing with "a level of cognitive impairment that requires significant societal support," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People get COVID-19, some people do fine and bounce back, but there are people who start experiencing problems with memory, cognition, and fuzzy brain," he said. "Even people with mild symptoms. They might not even be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diane Yormark, 67, of Boca Raton, Florida, can relate. She got COVID in 2022 and 2023. The second infection left her with brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like if you had a little bit too much wine the night before and you're out of it," said Yormark, a retired copywriter, who said the worst of her symptoms lasted for about three months after the infection. "Some of the fog has lifted. But do I feel like myself? Not like I was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from more than a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978692/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;dozen studies&lt;/a&gt; suggests COVID vaccines can help reduce risk of severe infection as well as longer-lasting health effects, although researchers say more study is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates remain low in the U.S., with only about 17% of the adult population reporting that they got the updated 2025-2026 shot as of Jan. 16, based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have reduced access to COVID vaccines despite the lack of any new, substantiated evidence of harm. Though the shots were a hallmark achievement of the first Trump administration, which led the effort for their development, Kennedy has said without evidence that they are "&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the deadliest vaccine ever made&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May he said on X that the CDC would &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;stop recommending COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, citing a &lt;a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/rfk-jr-makes-false-claims-about-covid-deaths-vaccine-safety-senate-hearing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lack of clinical data&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration has since issued new guidelines limiting the vaccine to people 65 or older and individuals 6 months or older with at least one risk factor, though many states continue to make them more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration also halted &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/mrna-vaccines-cuts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;almost $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA-based vaccines. Administration officials and a number of Republicans question the safety of the Nobel Prize-winning technology — heralded for the potential to treat many diseases beyond COVID — even though clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers were performed before the &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;COVID mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were made available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And numerous studies, including new research in 2025, show COVID vaccine benefits include a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2510226" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reduction in the severity of disease&lt;/a&gt;, although the protective effects wane over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following the findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say more and broader support is important because much remains unknown about COVID and its impact on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing awareness that, even in mild COVID cases, the possibility exists for longer-term, often undetected &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11834749/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;organ damage&lt;/a&gt; also warrants more examination, researchers say. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396425005560" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study published this month&lt;/a&gt; in eBioMedicine found people with neurocognitive issues such as changes in smell or headaches after infection had significant levels of a protein linked to Alzheimer's in their blood plasma. EBioMedicine is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, the virus leads to an immune response that triggers inflammation, can damage brain cells, and can even shrink brain volume, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;research on imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; that was published in March 2022 in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625002005" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Australian study&lt;/a&gt; of advanced brain images found significant alterations even among people who had already recovered from mild infections — a possible explanation for &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251215/COVID-19-could-leave-a-measurable-imprint-on-the-brain.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt; that may persist for years. Lead study author Kiran Thapaliya said the research suggests the virus "may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Alay agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know what will happen to people 10 years down the road," he said. "Inflammation of the brain is not a good thing. It's absolutely not a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That inflammatory response has also been linked to blood clots, arrhythmias, and higher risk of cardiovascular issues, even following a mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Southern California study published in October 2024 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found the risk for a &lt;a href="https:/www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.321001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;major cardiac event&lt;/a&gt; remains elevated nearly three years after COVID infection. The findings held even for people who were not hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to see the effects that far out" regardless of individual heart disease history, said James R. Hilser, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc7" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",7]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID can also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09332-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reactivate cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; and trigger a relapse, according to research published in July in the journal Nature. Researchers found that the chance of dying from cancer among cancer survivors was higher among people who'd had COVID, especially in the year after being infected. There was nearly a twofold increase in cancer mortality in those who tested positive compared with those who tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential of the COVID virus to affect future generations is yielding new findings as well. Australian researchers looked at male mice and found that those who had been &lt;a href="https://florey.edu.au/news/2025/10/covid-19-causes-changes-in-sperm-that-lead-to-increased-anxiety-in-offspring/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;infected with and then recovered&lt;/a&gt; from COVID experienced changes to their sperm that altered their offspring's behavior, causing them to exhibit more anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many people are now living — and struggling — with the virus' after-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee Farrand, 57, of Marana, Arizona, could once run five miles and was excelling at her job in sales. She recovered from a COVID infection in May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, her heart began to beat irregularly. Farrand underwent a battery of tests at a hospital. Ultimately, the condition became so severe she had to go on supplemental oxygen for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cognitive abilities declined so severely she couldn't read, because she'd forget the first sentence after reading the second. She also had to leave herself reminders that she is allergic to shrimp or that she likes avocados. She said she lost her job and returned to her previous occupation as a social worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was the person who is like the Energizer bunny and all of a sudden I'd get so tired getting dressed that I had to go back to bed," Farrand said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Before Mohammad Samad was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stage 3 colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 37, he felt in the best shape of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was eating all my greens, making those healthy smoothies in the morning. I was cycling, I was exercising. I was doing yoga and meditation," the former project manager, who is based&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the UK, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sudden, stabbing pain in Samad's lower abdomen in October 2020, which lasted 20 seconds, was the first sign that something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The force of it just made me fall to my knees," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December, the pain was more intense and happening every morning and night. He could also feel a hard, golf ball-sized lump in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;p&gt;Soon, he was &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/identical-twins-young-colon-cancer-diagnosis-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;exhausted all the time&lt;/a&gt;, and often&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;constipated and bloated. The lunch breaks he used to spend shooting hoops at a local park became nap time.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      After several visits to the doctor, Samad pushed for further testing.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Mohammad Samad
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samad presumed his symptoms were related to stress and his diet, or that he possibly had COVID-19. "In my head, it didn't seem that bad," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in January 2021, when he started to feel the lump, he finally went to see a doctor at his wife's request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the five months that followed, he made multiple visits to three different doctors and was misdiagnosed with stress, IBS, and Crohn's disease. Eventually, Samad was diagnosed with colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would look at me and go, '&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-young-people-getting-colon-cancer-answer-infancy-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;You're young, you're fit&lt;/a&gt;, you're healthy. We can see that.' And so they assume that it is a minor thing," he said of his doctor's visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;symptoms of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; and conditions including IBS overlap, which means doctors tread a tightrope when diagnosing younger, generally healthy patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samad's experience isn't unusual for young cancer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patients. A 2020 survey by the charity Bowel Cancer UK of 1,295 &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colorectal cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed under the age of 50 found that 42% said doctors told them they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were too young to have the disease. In addition, two-thirds were initially misdiagnosed with conditions that have similar symptoms,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;such as IBS, hemorrhoids, or anaemia. The survey echoes wider research on the misdiagnoses of young cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;common symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of early-onset colon cancer include blood in the stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b299cbe3-57db-4aad-95eb-9164579dfc7d" data-toc-id="b299cbe3-57db-4aad-95eb-9164579dfc7d"&gt;Samad was misdiagnosed with IBS and Crohn's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first doctor that Samad visited said she couldn't feel a lump when she pressed down on his abdomen, and suggested he could have "a blockage," likely caused by stress. She prescribed Samad laxatives and told him to return if his symptoms didn't improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four weeks later, when the laxatives hadn't helped, a different doctor prescribed him IBS medication and more laxatives. The doctor also recommended following an elimination diet to see if certain foods triggered the IBS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When things didn't improve after two weeks and Samad was told to keep taking the IBS medication and eliminating more foods, he demanded a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I kind of just put my foot down and said, 'I'm not leaving without a test,'" he said. It showed Samad had concerning levels of inflammation in his body, which was confirmed by blood and stool tests at the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, seven months after he first felt the intense pain, Samad was referred to a specialist who thought he had Crohn's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-in-my-30s-colonoscopy-cost-insurance-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;A colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, where a thin tube with a microscopic camera on the end is placed into the rectum and colon, showed Samad had a tumor, which a biopsy confirmed was advanced colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, it hadn't spread, but it was at that stage where they said to me, 'We're going to throw the kitchen sink at it," Samad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mind "entered a black hole" as the oncologist talked through the next steps. Samad's dad had recently died of COVID-19, and he worried about how his diagnosis would impact his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do I tell my mom who's just lost a life partner? How do I tell my siblings? How do I tell my children who have just been introduced to the concept of death by a loved one?" said Samad, whose two children were age 8 and 6 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fbe25dc7-b4d0-4e68-a2d1-eab2a454cc9c" data-toc-id="fbe25dc7-b4d0-4e68-a2d1-eab2a454cc9c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samad's treatment was derailed by infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samad had chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and surgery to remove it, but after two chemo cycles lasting four weeks each, he was hospitalized by a "nasty" infection for five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, he was too unwell to have chemo, and his tumor grew to the size of a small watermelon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tumour was getting larger and larger, and eventually they said, 'Your bowel is now perforated, bleeding all these toxins into your system,'' he said.&lt;/p&gt;

He has ongoing health issues, but has been cancer-free for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get regular checkups, and I've been given the all clear, which is amazing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="736e0aed-487d-4565-931f-1945afd58a8e" data-toc-id="736e0aed-487d-4565-931f-1945afd58a8e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tumor tested positive for Lynch syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samad's tumor tested positive for a genetic condition called &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Lynch Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which increases a person's risk of developing a number of cancers, including colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of younger people without Lynch syndrome &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;developing colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; despite leading healthy lifestyles is on the rise, for reasons scientists are trying to uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If caught early, colon cancer is often treatable. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people start getting screened at regular intervals when they turn 45, and people with a higher-than-average risk should ask a healthcare professional about when they should start testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In around March 2022, Samad started a blog to share his experience and raise awareness of the rising rates of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-people-cancer-crisis-risk-tips-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer in young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still that association that cancer is only for old people. It can affect everyone," he said, adding: "Just listen to your body, go see a specialist, check those symptoms, and really push for it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-new-high-protein-recipes-for-better-blood-sugar-8694761" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein recipes for better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 345 to 419 calories while the lunches span 334 to 478 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health impacts of high blood sugar levels?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, continuously elevated blood sugars can cause some serious harm. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels, which can reduce kidney function, cause vision loss, cause heart disease and negatively impact nearly every function in the body.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_182-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If improving blood sugars is your goal, research indicates that eating more protein may help. Protein is a nutrient with many health benefits, including supporting healthy blood sugar by slowing down digestion to mitigate blood sugar spikes. Eating a high-protein diet and reducing total carbohydrate can help reduce the risk, but it’s just one piece of this important puzzle. But, there’s no need to completely avoid carbs. Instead, opt to include &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-carbs-to-eat-according-to-a-dietitian-8364239" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like legumes, fruit and whole grains, while limiting refined grains and added sugars. The fiber in carbohydrates isn’t digested, which means it slows down digestion and, like protein, helps reduce blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber has many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that you would miss out on if carbs were reduced drastically.

The plan was simple: a warm bath, a few peaceful minutes, and no one needing anything. But Winnie’s mom, who shares their life over at @the.golden.girl.winnie, learned very quickly that this was not going to be a solo activity. When the video starts, we already see this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy dangling over the tub’s rim. She seems to think “sharing is caring” applies to bathwater, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy jumps into bathtub while owner is in it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens mid-chaos with Winnie deciding to join her mom for her bath time. Her mom films from within the tub as Winnie’s front paws begin to flail against the porcelain. She tries to pull herself in, essentially swimming through the air with her upper body. Eventually, she finds some traction and hauls her hind legs over the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She looks incredibly proud of this athletic achievement. One viewer joked, “Mum go in bath…. me go in bath,” which seems to be precisely what’s going through her head. If you live with a Golden Retriever, you already know water is rarely considered off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then the video cuts to this very soggy Golden Retriever puppy standing in one corner of the bathtub. She looks down at a red-and-blue toy floating nearby with curiosity. Her front paws rest on the rim, dripping a steady stream of water onto the bath mat below. There’s not a single ounce of remorse on her face as she stands there innocently. So much for mom’s “me time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comment section is obsessed with her lack of boundaries. One person noted that moms never actually get alone time, only “quality time” with a beautiful puppy. Another fan captured the mood perfectly, imagining Winnie thinking, “I’ll just uh.. scooch on in here.” Closed doors tend to be taken as a personal insult when there’s a dog in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/204252-golden-retriever-puppy-video-bath-tub-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Makes Plans of Her Own When Owner Hits the Tub;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Makes Plans of Her Own When Owner Hits the Tub&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPY1d3RVZ6dDdQdHp2dVBtMVE3MjdUVFVEaHlhS1A1WjhjTEN2NnFWOEgyTjlZczItcEthejk3U2I4R0x2dlBYbUdKSVBrdko5ZWxsQ0VTaWo1dFhoRjhkRGJ4SHBwb2ZRNGNoaW93YUJ6RkUta3FjTGk5RzZDd0kxR2R4cWpMRGJhQmhqNk82aElQRk9k</guid></item><item><title>疾控中心疫苗咨询委员会主席质疑脊髓灰质炎疫苗建议- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/chair-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-questions-polio-shot/story?id=129580522</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee questioned whether broad recommendations are necessary for vaccines that protect against polio and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who was appointed chair of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) by Health Secretary Robert F.

In the case of polio, improved sanitation increased the age at which a child was first exposed to polio -- after antibodies passed down from the mother wore off -- which made them more susceptible to paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit said it seems to him that Milhoan doesn’t know that improved sanitation increased cases of severe polio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"A lot of people don't know, but what upsets me is that he's in a position …  where he should know it,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Milhoan also questioned the need for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is also &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC for children and required by every U.S. state to attend public schools. Last year, the U.S. saw the highest number of measles cases in 33 years with 2,255 infections, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He argued that measles cases were declining before the advent of the vaccine and that hospitals are better equipped to take care of measles patients today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Dr. Neville Anderson, left, helps to hold Iris Behnam, 4, while nurse Breanna Kirby, right, gives her DTap Polio and MMR Chickenpox (Varicilla) vaccinations while her mom, Haley Behnam, holds and comforts her at Larchmont Pediatrics in Los Angeles, March 25, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Allen J.

"Our ability to have pediatric hospitals, children's hospitals, pediatric ICUs, how we look at the whole gamut of how we can treat measles is different. So that's something that comes into play."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit said it's not true that doctors have gotten better at treating measles among children who are hospitalized. No treatments have been developed in the last six decades, after the first measles vaccine became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're no better at treating measles than we were 60 years ago," Offit said. "I mean, what do we have? We have oxygen, we have ventilation. We had that in the 1960s. And in terms of dehydration, we had intravenous fluids. Again, no difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit also said that since the measles vaccine was developed, the death rate hasn't changed.

"We've had three people die, two of whom were children, this past year, among, let's say, 2,100 people who had measles. That's the same mortality rate as we had before there was a measles vaccine. So, what's [Milhoan] talking about?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Co-host Dr. Mark Abdemalek pressed Milhoan during the podcast about the adverse risks of measles infection being worse than risks from the MMR vaccine and brought up the same one in three mortality figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is not current data," Milhoan replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Co-host Tom Johnson asked Milhoan about his philosophy on individual autonomy with the example of a parent who chooses not to get their child vaccinated against measles and that child subsequently infects a different immunocompromised child. Johnson asked Milhoan if there is a line to cross where individual autonomy infringes on another child's safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I would say I agree, there are two different things at play here. We don’t take one over the other,” Milhoan said. “Let’s just flip that the other way around. What if the child gets a measles vaccine to protect your immunocompromised child and gets a negative consequence from that? Wasn’t that your child causing that child to be harmed?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When asked directly whether vaccines are adequately studied for safety, Milhoan said they are not, arguing that research has focused primarily on efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He dismissed the surveillance and monitoring systems as "very poor," signaling deep skepticism about the current infrastructure used to detect and evaluate vaccine safety signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit said the comment that concerned him the most was when Milhoan was told by one of the hosts that ACIP would probably be receiving reports, files and data on vaccines to review based on established science, to which Milhoan replied, "That's not science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Science is what I observe," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;The MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Health Department in Lubbock, Texas, Feb. 27, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Annie Rice/Reuters, FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In response to perceived attacks from news organizations following the podcast, the Independent Medical Alliance, a group that promoted unproven treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, defended Milhoan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Dr. Milhoan is an accomplished pediatric cardiologist and former U.S. Air Force physician who believes the Constitution protects citizens from government intrusion into personal medical decisions," the statement read, in part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"To be clear, Dr. Milhoan is not anti-vaccine.

He died of congestive heart failure at the age of 89. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born March 12, 1936, in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/local/iowa/decorah" text-decoration="none" class="Box-sc-ucqo0b-0 Link-sc-1u14kdb-0 HtmlContent___StyledLink-sc-ngx07-0 kEMoTa dEdZYg hRYGv"&gt;Decorah, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Foege was the third of six children raised by William A. Foege, a Lutheran minister, and his wife Anne Erika. His family moved to Chewelah, Washington, during his youth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning a B.A. in biology from Pacific Lutheran University in 1957, he studied medicine at the University of Washington, receiving his M.D. in 1961. He later earned a Master of Public Health from Harvard University in 1965. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foege's work in public health began with field experience in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the 1960s, while in Nigeria, he developed a "ring vaccination" or "surveillance-containment" strategy to control smallpox outbreaks by locating cases and vaccinating people in close contact with them. This method was instrumental in eventually eradicating smallpox worldwide. It is the only human disease to have been entirely eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to serve as director of the CDC from 1977 to 1983, guiding the agency through a period of expanded global engagement and disease control efforts. Among his challenges as CDC head was the emerging AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. He worked to coordinate a group of epidemiologists to research the disease and fought for federal funding to support that research. His frustration with the initially slow federal response to the AIDS crisis contributed to his 1983 retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving CDC leadership, he held key roles at The Carter Center and as a senior adviser to the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He also joined the faculty of Emory University as a professor of international health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foege was widely recognized for his humanitarian impact on global health. Among his many accolades was the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President Barack Obama in 2012. He was honored by such universities as Harvard, Yale, and the University of Michigan, and he was given the CDC Foundation Hero Award in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleagues and followers noted Foege's humility and focus on collaborative achievement. "Nothing is done by an individual," he once said, embodying a spirit of partnership that defined his approach to public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foege's influence extended far beyond smallpox. He co-founded the Task Force for Global Health, which has worked in over 150 countries to expand immunizations and strengthen health systems. He also championed efforts to combat polio, river blindness, and measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, Paula (Ristad) Foege; two sons, Robert and Michael; three sisters; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by his son David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Legacy News Staff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Image: James Gathany of the CDC via Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Legacy | Obituary</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:32:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOZnlzNHVWV01jZFhLYkZSbHNrZkZzMk9aRHBHR2Y1RjVudG5rTG5NSFBGSmluOS0tUWdVQjloZ0ZFTmhjN3YwQjJ6a0FudDRXd3VLOWR0Vi04YW0tc2l5YnNaNW1wbnRPY1ZFR1JfUllyQ2lxZzBiVEpWVTVOWEg4ZVVOeXFvSmxpTVRycXVCOG4</guid></item><item><title>美国儿科学会发布与CDC不同的儿童疫苗建议- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-academy-of-pediatrics-vaccine-recommendations/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-announces-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAP is recommending &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;immunization against 18 diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country," AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement Monday.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told "CBS Evening News" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is "still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending," Kravitz said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on "shared clinical decision-making" with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician," Kravitz said Monday. "We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AAP &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;called the CDC's guidance&lt;/a&gt; "dangerous and unnecessary" at the time of its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children," the AAP said Monday. "By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, "The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms," adding it would "work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-birth-dose/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a controversial December recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on when children should receive their first dose of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hepatitis-b-vaccine-vote-immunization-policy-public-trust/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acip-vaccine-panel-ousted-by-rfk-jr-speaks-out/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hand-picked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by HHS Secretary &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/rfk-hearing-senate-finance-committee-cdc-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a longtime &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-aluminum-ingredients/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-says-it-may-be-better-if-fewer-children-receive-the-flu-vaccine/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, "We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be "a better thing" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

They were looking for genes behind gut motility in a dataset of more than 260,000 people from populations in Europe and East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geneticist Cristian Diaz-Muñoz from the Basque Research &amp;amp; Technology Alliance says the markers he and his team found were like road signs to unexpected locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used genetics to build a roadmap of biological pathways that set the gut's pace," he &lt;a href="https://www.cicbiogune.es/news/dna-ties-gut-motility-vitamin-b1"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.

Instead, each person's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-blood-test-could-reveal-your-chances-of-dying-in-the-next-decade"&gt;risk of death&lt;/a&gt; was estimated and compared with that of their peers, allowing researchers to model how changes in activity levels might impact their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's notable that the biggest benefits were predicted among people who were typically less active and spent more of the day sitting. In other words, in terms of physical exercise and avoiding a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-ideal-number-of-daily-steps-to-offset-sitting-down"&gt;sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, those who are currently doing the least stand to gain the most from making relatively small changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the observational nature of the study leaves it short of proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the large datasets involved and the significance of the association suggest it's something worth studying further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We only investigated all-cause mortality; thus, future research should examine other health outcomes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02219-6"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Additional research using device-measured physical activity is needed in low-income and middle-income countries where the age structure, physical activity levels, and disease burden differ from those included in the present study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer encouragement for people who struggle to find the time or motivation to exercise regularly.

One Type Was Just Linked to Better Brain Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still the case that more exercise is better for you, of course – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;the World Health Organization recommends&lt;/a&gt; 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity a week – but small steps still make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A clear message we want to get across is that every movement counts and getting inactive people to do some activity is where we see the biggest gains in health," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-small-achievable-changes-in-physical-activity-linked-to-lower-mortality-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; sedentary behavior scientist Daniel Bailey from Brunel University of London, who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, GPs, policymakers, or campaigners can certainly be looking to support patients and the public with making these relatively small changes to start with, which would give people a starting point to then kick on and increase their activity even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)02219-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This month, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2026-01-05/u-s-changes-childhood-vaccine-schedule-to-require-fewer-immunizations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:announced drastic changes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced drastic changes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC’s vaccine schedule, slashing the number of diseases that it recommends U.S. children be routinely vaccinated against to 11 from 17. That follows the CDC's decision last year to reverse its recommendation that all kids get the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Monday, the AAP released its own &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf?_gl=1*5x36zh*_ga*MjI5NzM0NzQzLjE3NTEyNTc4Mjc.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3Njk0NTkyNzQkbzQxJGcwJHQxNzY5NDU5Mjc0JGo2MCRsMCRoMA.." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immunization guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;immunization guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which now look very different from the federal government’s. The organization, which represents most of the nation’s primary care and specialty doctors for children, recommends that children continue to be routinely vaccinated against 18 diseases, just as the CDC did before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over the nation’s health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Endorsed by a dozen medical groups, the AAP schedule is far and away the preferred version for most healthcare practitioners. California’s public health department &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR26-001.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommends &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that families and physicians follow the AAP schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As there is a lot of confusion going on with the constant new recommendations coming out of the federal government, it is important that we have a stable, trusted, evidence-based immunization schedule to follow and that’s the AAP schedule,” &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34141/AAP-s-2026-immunization-schedule-keeps-routine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said Dr. Pia Pannaraj;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;said Dr. Pia Pannaraj&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a member of AAP’s infectious disease committee and professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both schedules recommend that all children be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (better known as chickenpox).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;AAP urges families to also routinely vaccinate their kids against hepatitis A and B, COVID-19, rotavirus, flu, meningococcal disease and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC, on the other hand, now says these shots are optional for most kids, though it still recommends them for those in certain high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The schedules also vary in the recommended timing of certain shots. AAP advises that children get two doses of HPV vaccine starting at ages 9 to12, while the CDC recommends one dose at age 11 or 12. The AAP advocates &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/7903/CDC-approves-2-dose-HPV-vaccine-schedule" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:starting the vaccine sooner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;starting the vaccine sooner&lt;/a&gt;, as younger immune systems produce more antibodies. While several recent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(25)00372-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; found that a single dose of the vaccine confers as much protection as two, there is &lt;a href="https://www.sgo.org/news/the-new-u-s-childhood-vaccine-schedule-a-key-change-for-hpv-immunization/#:~:text=The%20revised%20CDC%20recommendations%20categorize,coverage%20will%20remain%20in%20place." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:no single-dose HPV vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;no single-dose HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; licensed in the U.S. yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pediatricians' group also continues to recommend the long-standing practice of a single shot combining the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines in order to limit the number of jabs children get. In September, a key CDC advisory panel stocked with hand-picked Kennedy appointees recommended that the MMR and varicella vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-18/acip-rfk-jr-vote-mmr-shots" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:be given as separate shots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;be given as separate shots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a move that confounded public health experts for its seeming lack of scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The AAP is one of several medical groups &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suing HHS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;suing HHS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The AAP's suit describes as “arbitrary and capricious” Kennedy’s alterations to the nation’s vaccine policy, most of which have been made without the thorough scientific review that previously preceded changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Days before AAP released its new guidelines, it was &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/contrary-cdc-changes-aap-advises-vaccinating-kids-against-18-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hit with a lawsuit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hit with a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; from Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded and previously led, alleging that its vaccine guidance over the years amounted to a form of racketeering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC’s efforts to collect the data that typically inform public health policy have noticeably slowed under Kennedy’s leadership at HHS. A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published Monday found that of 82 CDC databases previously updated at least once a month, 38 had &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022-PS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unexplained interruptions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;unexplained interruptions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with most of those pauses lasting six months or longer. Nearly 90% of the paused databases included vaccination information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections,” Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:editorial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;editorial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Annals of Internal Medicine, a scientific journal.

As you slowly introduce them back, one by one, you see how your body responds. The goal is to determine what foods may trigger you specifically so you can limit them for the sake of better and smoother digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="factors" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Replace Missing Digestive Factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about what you eat—it’s also about how your comprehensive digestive system breaks down and absorbs the nutrients from what you eat. Our bodies naturally produce &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-digestive-enyzmes" target="_blank"&gt;digestive enzymes&lt;/a&gt;, typically in the salivary glands, pancreas, and small intestines, to help break down food efficiently to allow for maximum nutrient absorption. If your body is struggling to make enough digestive enzymes, it can cause uncomfortable side effects around meal time like cramping, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and more. “Digestive support like digestive bitters or enzymes are generally supportive and well tolerated by most people,” says Gerber, who notes that those with active gallstones or kidney stones should avoid bitters. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-electrolyte-drink" target="_blank"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; with foundational minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium can be beneficial as a baseline, too. “We need minerals to help make digestive juices like stomach acid and digestive enzymes,” adds Gerber. “Digestive bitters and enzymes naturally help upregulate your own digestive juice secretions,” says Gerber. “It gives a natural nudge to your stomach acid digestive enzymes and bile to help you digest your food better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you eat your food is crucial too. “Start with chewing well,” says Gerber who suggests 10-12 chews per bite—ideally until liquefied before you swallow. “And slow down, take deep breaths, and sit down for all meals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

Bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard about “good” bacteria versus “bad” bacteria. Bad bacteria can cause illness, inflammation, and digestive issues when they overgrow, invade, and crowd out the beneficial bacteria. Certain medications, like antibiotics, stress as well as diets high in ultra-processed foods, refined sugars, and more are associated with bad gut microbes. “There’s as many bacteria as there are cells in our body and 100 times as much bacterial DNA as regulating everything about our health,” says Hyman. When you’re in gut repair mode, it’s crucial to bring back the good bacteria. “Your good gut bugs love diversity when it comes to allowing them to flourish and survive,” says Gerber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-probiotic-for-women" target="_blank"&gt;Probiotic&lt;/a&gt;-rich foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, unsweetened yogurt or kefir, miso, and more introduce live, good bacteria directly into your gut. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-prebiotics" target="_blank"&gt;Prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; fiber, the soluble fibers found in Jerusalem artichoke, garlic, onions, leeks, dandelion greens, jicama, chicory root, asparagus, and more, are essential too. They act as fuel for the probiotics, providing energy to help nourish and grow beneficial bacteria. “Eat an abundance of polyphenol-rich vegetables daily,” says Hyman. Polyphenols act as prebiotics and can help inhibit harmful bacteria, too. Some great examples are spinach, broccoli, carrots, artichokes, red onion, and asparagus. If your diet is lacking these essential nutrients, a high-quality comprehensive probiotic supplement can help restore microbiome balance, as can a multivitamin and prebiotic fiber to support intestinal health and gut barrier function. However, while probiotics can be wonderful tools for supporting gut health for many people, there is some nuance, and your symptoms, history, and tolerance should be taken into consideration. “Not all probiotics are created equally,” says Fazio. “Different strains and profiles can deliver different targeted results so it’s best to find the specific one that will work for you with a trusted practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="repair" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Repair the Gut Lining&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut flora will thrive when it’s consistently fueled with a wide variety of plant fibers from vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. However, there’s only a thin cell layer between your intestines and body—and that determines what should be absorbed into your body. Think of it as a coffee filter: the filter prevents the grounds from getting into your coffee, leaving you with only the clear, rich liquid. But if there’s a hole in your filter, the grounds can leak into your coffee. The same is true for your intestines—if you have increased intestinal permeability (a.k.a., leaky gut) what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; leak into your body is fungus, not-so-good bacteria, or undigested food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 01:02:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBWbnI3Z1QtaXhoSi1tNXRTai1nQllub3FnMkg1d19ZQmxVNGVEdjRUOVFzUkdHekVOWWg5eWFSVXhHX1ZrZ3Z1TUdkblc0RmY0S1k3eGk1YW9hdjg1SFMw</guid></item><item><title>与阿尔茨海默氏症样大脑变化相关的更年期-英国广播公司</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qpp1g5ylvo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Menopause linked to Alzheimer's-like brain changes&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-3adb3607-0 fkltMW"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-3adb3607-12 csUdlZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-3adb3607-5 iMnQuR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-3adb3607-7 echTHp"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-3adb3607-8 dcphMW"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-3adb3607-9 dRohlg"&gt;Digital health editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dc0f/live/2d494aa0-fae8-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Scientist looking at 3D rendered graphic scans" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The menopause is linked to changes in the brain similar to those seen in Alzheimer's, according to a large UK study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The loss of grey matter in areas involved with memory and emotion might partly explain why women are generally at greater risk of dementia than men, researchers speculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The findings come from nearly 125,000 women, of whom 11,000 had MRI brain scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725102845" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Psychological Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use did not appear to prevent the grey matter loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Barbara Sahakian, senior author and from Cambridge University, said: "The brain regions where we saw these differences are ones that tend to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Menopause could make these women vulnerable further down the line.

It &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/lung-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claims 33,100 lives a year&lt;/a&gt; across the UK, about 91 a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also a key area for improvement because it is a stark example of health inequalities that mirror people’s wealth. It affects poorer people so disproportionately that it accounts for an entire year of the nine-year gap in life expectancy between England’s most and least deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;NHS chiefs hope that deploying AI and robotic technology will help doctors uncover more cases, which will enable treatment to start sooner and enhance the patient’s chances of survival. The trial will be undertaken at Guy’s and St Thomas’ &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; trust in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is a glimpse of the future of cancer detection”, said Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England’s national clinical director for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the trial, AI software will analyse lung scans and alert doctors to the presence of small lumps – some just 6mm long, the size of a grain of rice – that are most likely to be cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A robotic camera will then guide the miniature tools used to undertake a biopsy, to produce a sample of tissue that can be analysed in a laboratory more precisely than with existing techniques. That will enable potentially cancerous nodules hidden deep in someone’s lung, which are hard to spot at present, to be removed and examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If shown to be effective, the technology could help transform lung cancer diagnosis as the NHS screening programme increasingly identifies more people with very small nodules that would previously have gone undetected until much later”, NHS England said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For many patients, weeks of repeat scans and procedures could be replaced with a single half-hour cancer biopsy, reducing prolonged uncertainty and avoiding more invasive surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:11,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team behind the trial has already carried out about 300 robotic biopsies, which led to 215 people having cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the UK, but diagnosing it at an earlier stage can significantly improve people’s chances of survival”, said the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, Michelle Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“New technologies like this have huge potential, and tests to ensure they’re accurate and beneficial for patients in the real world should happen quickly so that innovations can reach everyone sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOaTJzbzlUOXdmX2lscGNsSGxTcFliekktSF9SY1FKelBiMFpOMlh3SjZKS1JRM1BKamhmSW5MVlJTWEstbDQtT0JTeTltdWF3cVhwM2tLTW9MdUNINXRvUlE0SkdqUWkzbjJFR2hjWnd2eHJmd21xYlV2Wi02Ri1aUGgzMmxpQlZyOFZVWld4VFJRSzhxTDJUYjlCbDJqeWZBX21IVWtOaUFQcURlMEVIMGs5NmZubVlxamJlQ3Y4ajBOUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，数十个CDC数据库尚未更新—大多数与疫苗有关- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-databases-not-updated-vaccines-study-rcna255467</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-029a28" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly half of the databases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used to update regularly — surveillance systems that tracked public health information like Covid vaccination rates and hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus — have been paused without explanation, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be0222" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, indicate that at the start of 2025, the CDC maintained 82 databases that were updated at least monthly. But by the end of October, the study found, 38 had gone stale, with 34 showing no new entries at all in the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43efd1" class="body-graf"&gt;“These unexplained pauses started predominantly in March and April 2025, shortly after Mr. Trump assumed the presidency and Mr. Kennedy was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76ec03" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the CDC is perhaps best known for issuing public health advisories and recommendations, the agency also plays a key role as a national record-keeper, tracking the spread of infections and uptake of vaccines in as close to real time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4be76" class="body-graf"&gt;But the CDC appears to be backing away from that part of its work, the new research suggests. The study found that nearly 90% of the paused databases were related to vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-67da31" class="body-graf"&gt;As examples, study author Dr. Jeremy Jacobs, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to one database that monitored weekly Covid vaccinations among pregnant women and another that tracked Covid vaccinations among all U.S. adults (with breakdowns based on demographics and geographical region). Both were last updated in late April, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d65493" class="body-graf"&gt;Other out-of-date databases looked at respiratory illnesses treated in emergency departments and the use of an injectable drug that can protect infants from RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-341565" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s curious that all these changes are primarily, and almost exclusively, in the area of vaccination,” said Noel Brewer, another study author and a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e434c" class="body-graf"&gt;“On the face of this, this all looks fairly deliberate, but we don’t really know why these websites went silent,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90c721" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department, said the CDC reports Covid and RSV activity through its respiratory virus surveillance systems and reports weekly flu activity through a database called FluView.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b3a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction,” Nixon said in a statement. “Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1feb1" class="body-graf"&gt;Without current information from these databases, several public health experts said, it is more difficult to know what vaccination coverage looks like on the national or regional level — which, consequently, can make it harder to deal with new outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec70f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Lisa Lee, senior associate vice president for research and innovation at Virginia Tech, spent 14 years at the CDC, including as chief science officer in the agency’s office of surveillance and epidemiology. She said local health officials often rely on CDC databases to guide their responses to public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a3c48f" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we, for example, see wild-type polio again in our country because we have reduced uptake of vaccine, that is the surveillance system that’s telling us this information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f83f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, chief executive officer of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527" target="_blank"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; also published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine that the lapse in updates — whether intentional or not — demonstrates “a profound disregard for human life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce49c4" class="body-graf"&gt;“The evidence is damning: The administration’s antivaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections,” she said. Marrazzo served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases until September, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired her. She is suing Kennedy and other Trump administration officials, alleging she was let go in part because of her strong defense of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75f101" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, the authors — a team of public health and medical experts and one law professor — suggest that the CDC may have stopped updating the databases due to reductions in its workforce, budget cuts or shifting attitudes about vaccines among federal health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dd37b" class="body-graf"&gt;Their findings reflect a larger trend of changes to the CDC’s website, some involving unreliable information that contradicts scientific consensus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32e6b9" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is especially concerning, given the broader context. There’s misinformation about vaccines and vaccine safety being disseminated through official channels at HHS by non-health professionals,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1431de" class="body-graf"&gt;In November, a web page that once unequivocally stated that vaccines do not cause autism was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;rewritten to say&lt;/a&gt; that “studies have not ruled out the possibility.” The message flew in the face of decades of scientific research that has found no link between autism and vaccines. Prior to that, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/federal-websites-temporarily-go-dark-order-comply-trump-dei-directive-rcna190244" target="_blank"&gt;removed language&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to gender identity and diversity, equity, inclusion, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-dei-hiv-cdc-website-removed-lgbtq-rcna190068" target="_blank"&gt;information on HIV&lt;/a&gt; and contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1d588c" class="body-graf"&gt;The website changes are part of a broader overhaul of the country’s public health agencies under Kennedy’s leadership. In the year since he became health secretary, the U.S. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312" target="_blank"&gt;stopped recommending routine Covid shots for healthy kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281" target="_blank"&gt;slashed funding for mRNA vaccine research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt;overhauled the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; to include fewer universal recommendations. Kennedy also fired the CDC’s previous committee of vaccine advisers and replaced them with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of the shots. In December, the new panel &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-stops-recommending-hepatitis-b-vaccines-newborns-rcna248035" target="_blank"&gt;rolled back a decadeslong recommendation&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1755f9" class="body-graf"&gt;“It pains me to say that you need to really look at some of these recommendations with caution,” Marrazzo said. “If I were a parent, I would trust my board-certified pediatrician, who hopefully is a member of, or aligned with, the American Academy of Pediatrics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb06f3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The academy on Monday released its own &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;_gl=1*182sr3a*_ga*MTAwMjU1Mzg4Ni4xNzY5NDYzNTg2*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3Njk0NjM1ODYkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njk0NjM1ODYkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*NzYwMTAxMDI5LjE3Njk0NjM1ODU.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3Njk0NjM1ODYkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njk0NjM1ODYkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;guidance for childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to the schedule the CDC recommended before Kennedy announced sweeping changes earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNX25pZVVmbTJqeGNoNGRWeE1FWU5QOFBoMktVZ05BWUNDVDBHY0pXa0hELVViSDZPdE16NTBuSUJac1pkTEVxdzlpcnJkcVhqM3puNEdMcnpxYS1nbFRDamhtU1BuejltZWtRXy1TVW5IYW9RcWRIbEJKNVhiSm84T3FhRXpDRTktNXZpUVFEOU0xTFVKZWVfeTF3</guid></item><item><title>发现肾结石形成中以前未知的细菌成分- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-previously-unknown-bacterial-component-kidney.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in early 2025 pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes, showing how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence"&gt;Study Traces Autism's Origin to The Rise of Human Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="190112" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="190112" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="190112" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.
