"We typically thought of the sperm as a bag of DNA on a tail. But as we've started to realise, it's quite a complex cell – there's a lot of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3015006/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;[other] genetic information in there&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost 200 years later, in 1869, Johannes Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician and biologist, was studying human white blood cells collected from pus left on soiled hospital bandages when he &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7268995/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;discovered what he called "nuclein"&lt;/a&gt; inside the nuclei. The term "nuclein" was later changed to "nucleic acid" and eventually became "deoxyribonucleic acid" – or "DNA". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since then, our understanding of sperm has moved on leaps and bounds. But &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000953" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;much still remains a mystery&lt;/a&gt;, says Watkins. As scientists have started to better understand early embryonic development, he adds, they are realising that sperm doesn't just pass the father's chromosomes on, but also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-025-01815-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;epigenetic information&lt;/a&gt;, an extra layer of information that affects how and when the genes should be used. "It can really influence how the embryo develops and potentially the lifelong trajectory of the offspring that those sperm generate," says Watkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;It turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up – Scott Pitnick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sperm cells begin to form from puberty onwards, made in vessels within the testicles called seminiferous tubules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you look inside the testes where the sperm are made, it starts as just a round cell that looks pretty much like anything else," says Watkins. "Then it undergoes this dramatic change where it becomes a sperm head with a tail. No other cell within the body changes its structure, its shape, in such a unique way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;After ejaculation, each of these tiny cells must propel themselves forward (alongside their 50 million competitors) using their tail-like appendages to swim for the egg.

If more than one sperm were to fuse with the egg, a condition called &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26843/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;polyspermy&lt;/a&gt; would arise.

First, its plasma membrane rapidly depolarises – meaning it creates &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.carlsonscience.com/fast-block" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;an electrical barrier&lt;/a&gt; that further sperm cannot cross. However, this only lasts a short time before returning to normal. This is where the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26843/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cortical reaction&lt;/a&gt; comes in. A sudden release of calcium causes the zona pellucida – the egg's "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2528931/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;extracellular coat&lt;/a&gt;" – to become hardened, creating an impenetrable barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;What external factors affect male fertility and why.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One way researchers are hoping to shed light on sperm is by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18005" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;studying species other than our own&lt;/a&gt;, says Scott Pitnick, a professor of biology at Syracuse University in New York. Human sperm cells are microscopic, so we can't see them with the naked eye. But some fruit fly species produce sperm cells &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18005" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;20 times their own body length&lt;/a&gt;. That would be like a man producing sperm the length of a 40m (130ft) python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Why do males in some species make a few giant sperm?" asks Pitnick. "The answer, it turns out, is because females have evolved reproductive tracts that favour them." That's "not really much of an answer", he adds, because it's just the redirects the question: why have females evolved this way? "We still don't understand that at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Research suggests sperm counts are tumbling globally and the decline appears to be accelerating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it does teach us that sperm as they exist in the male body is only half the story, says Pitnick. "There's a massive sex bias historically in science. There's been this obscenely biased male focus on male traits. But it turns out that what's driving the system is female evolution – and males are just trying to keep up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It turns out the female reproductive tract is this incredibly, rapidly evolving environment," says Pitnick, "and we don't know much about what sperm do inside the female. That is the big, hidden world. I think the female reproductive tract is the greatest unexplored frontier for sexual selection, theory and speciation [the process by which &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/speciation-the-origin-of-new-species-26230527/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new species are formed&lt;/a&gt;]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The fruit fly's long-tailed sperm, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02587-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests Pitnick&lt;/a&gt;, could be considered an ornament – much like a deer's antlers or a peacock's tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ornaments are a "sort of a weapon in evolution", explains Pitnick. More than just a defence from predators, ornaments like antlers and horns often have two roles to play. "A lot of these weapons are about sex, and usually male-male competition. The [fruit fly's] long sperm flagellum really meets the definitional criteria of an ornament. We think the female tract has traits that bias fertilisation in favour of some sperm phenotypes over others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We know a lot about pre-mating sexual selection, Pitnick says. "Say, it's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20240902-how-controlled-burns-can-help-wildlife" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prairie chickens dancing&lt;/a&gt; out on a grassland, or a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023wbh0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bird of paradise displaying&lt;/a&gt; in a rainforest. It's motion, it's colour, it's smells?" Processing this sensory input, explains Pitnick, leads to decision making – whether the pair mate or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But, Pitnick says, the sexual selection that goes on inside the female after mating – and how this drives the evolution of sperm – largely remains a mystery.

"Sperm are not mature when they finish developing in the testes, they're not done developing." Complex – and critical – interactions occur between the sperm and the female reproductive tract, he says. "We're now spending a lot of time studying what we call &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://experts.syr.edu/en/publications/post-ejaculatory-modifications-to-sperm-pems" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;post-ejaculatory modifications to sperm&lt;/a&gt; across the whole animal kingdom." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/978920068315" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;2023 report&lt;/a&gt; published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), around one in six adults worldwide experience infertility – and male infertility contributes to roughly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20230327-how-pollution-is-causing-a-male-fertility-crisis" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;half of all cases&lt;/a&gt;. (It's also worth noting that many people around the world are not having as many children as they want for other reasons too, such as the prohibitive cost of parenthood, as a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynq459wxgo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent United Nation population Fund report highlighted&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"With all those moving parts, there are so many things that could go wrong," says Hannah Morgan, a post-doctoral research associate in maternal and fetal health at the University of Manchester, UK. "It could be a mechanism: it doesn't swim very well, so it can't get to the egg. Or it could be something more intricate within the head of the sperm, or other regions of the sperm. It's so specialised in so many different ways, that lots of little things can go wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One way to see if a man may be infertile is to look inside the sperm, says Morgan. "How does the DNA look? How is it packaged? How fragmented is it? To break open the sperm, there's a whole range of stuff you could look at. But what is a good or bad measurement? We don't actually know." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Perhaps by unravelling the mystery of sperm and how they function, Morgan says, we might begin to understand male infertility too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 09:01:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPektuVkZrZTRMWnRMSHF0UGdvNGRrUXF6OWpjeXRtNHZwUHdBMTlwVk0wY3ZfZGNDRFFZQ2RpeWlLRk1POVQtZXl0ZTdLODc5clVfWHg4N0lzcmpLRVJuZVVwbjVYbXpFME1WQzYwczd3VXJOc29SeXVKWklNUjFSQjNndldoV1pfZnhTWGhpNUpIeEw5NG5vcWduWDdTLVBfZVBz</guid></item><item><title>甜点中令人惊讶的成分会增加心脏病发作的风险-每日邮报 | Surprising ingredient in dessert favorites that raises your risk of a heart attack - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiologists are warning of an often overlooked ingredient in desserts that can lead to high blood pressure if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically a garnish on cookies, bread and butter, soft pretzels, and caramel treats, coarse sea salt contains more sodium than its less expensive grocery store alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People enjoy the added crunch and marriage of savory and sweet in desserts, but people are inadvertently eating too much salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because coarse salt has larger crystals, it may feel less salty per bite, leading some people to use more than they would with fine salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14603535/Adding-salt-food-increase-risk-depression-anxiety-40-cent-study-finds.html"&gt;only needs a small amount&lt;/a&gt; of sodium to function properly.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Body parts like hands, feet, and ankles are likely to swell. And feelings of thirst take over due to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much salt before bed can also cause restless sleep. Studies suggest high-salt diets may alter cortisol (stress hormone) levels, which regulate sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12737661/Reducing-salt-one-teaspoon-blood-pressure-medication.html" class=""&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Vanderbilt University found that reducing daily salt intake by just one teaspoon is as effective as blood pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tested high and low-salt diets on hundreds of patients, some of whom had high blood pressure, and found that cutting out a can of Heinz soup each day lowered people's blood pressure by six percent within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduction was comparable to that of thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, a popular blood pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 89 percent of adults and around 94 percent of children consume too much sodium, according to the CDC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;“Obviously we need some sodium—it's essential for life,” Dr Egan said. But ‘here we are with an average intake of 3,400 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now the body has to make a lot of adjustments, but we can get by with very little sodium,’ he said, noting ‘there's very little danger in this country that most people won't get enough sodium, even if they're eating those fresh foods and not processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They'll still—for the most part—get more than sufficient sodium that the body needs,” said Dr. Egan. “We live in a state of pretty much constant excess.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent segment on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the “Today” show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://drchantrise.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Chantrise Holliman&lt;/a&gt;, a mother, wife and heart health educator based in Georgia,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shared the story of her &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/heart-attack" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; and what seemed like the fairly benign symptoms that accompanied it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliman experienced nausea, vomiting and mild chest pressure. The first two symptoms ― which aren’t commonly associated with heart attacks ― led her to believe the sensations had more to do with her dinner the night before than a serious medical concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Holliman, many people don’t know that stomach symptoms can, indeed, be signs of a heart attack. While not the most common warning sign (chest pain is most reported), nausea is also not uncommon during a cardiac event, according to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1316106776/sean-p-heffron" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Sean Heffron&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “tends to depend somewhat on which blood vessel in the heart is affected,” Heffron explained. Additionally, nausea is more commonly seen in women, Heffron said, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/heart_attack.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;as is vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other heart attack signs in women include jaw pain, neck pain, a dull feeling of chest discomfort, upper abdomen pain, back pain and excessive tiredness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to hear stories like this, because many women think it has to be like, ‘I’m clutching my chest and falling to the ground like you see in the movies,’ and it can be much more subtle,” Dr. Tara Narula, a cardiologist and NBC News medical contributor, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;told “Today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks can look very different in women than in men, which means that sufferers and doctors alike sometimes dismiss them. But it’s important to recognize the signs, especially since heart disease “is the leading cause of death for women in this country,” Narula told “Today.” “One woman every 80 seconds dies of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell if your nausea is part of a heart attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that several nutrients are linked with a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nutrients include vitamins and minerals that act as antioxidants, plus fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High sugar intake was related to an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, it’s natural to become more forgetful. But when the occasional “Where did I leave my keys?” becomes forgetting loved ones’ names and your own address, it may be a sign of something more serious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is a general term for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loss of memory&lt;/a&gt;, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities, severe enough to interfere with everyday life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is the most common type of dementia. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dementia cases are expected to double&lt;/a&gt; by the year 2060. And the economic burden of unpaid dementia caregiving in the U.S. is expected to skyrocket from an average of $172 billion in 2020 to over $1.5 trillion by 2060.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And this doesn’t take into account the emotional toll on families, friends and caregivers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there is currently no cure for dementia, taking &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activity-to-limit-for-reduced-risk-dementia-8548330" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt; can be a wise move. Columbia University researchers wanted to know which nutrients were related to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-factors-reduce-early-dementia-risk-new-study-8423035" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;—and which ones might increase the risk. They recently published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing U.S. study conducted biennially since 1992 that includes adults 50 years and older. In 2013, food consumption and nutrition intake was collected from a subset of the HRS called the Healthcare and Nutrition Study (HCNS).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate diet, participants completed a food frequency questionnaire that asked how frequently they consumed 163 different foods and beverages over the past 12 months. From this, the research team calculated nutrient intake based on participants’ responses for 101 nutrients. Individual nutrients were assessed regarding their relationship to dementia. In addition, researchers calculated composite scores for some groups of nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants’ cognitive abilities were assessed using two different methods. One method was via a telephone interview with participants and the other was via a proxy respondent. For the proxy method, someone close to the participant answered questions about the participant’s memory levels, limitations in instrumental activities of daily living and status of cognitive impairment. Researchers would use this information to look for associations between nutrient intake and dementia risk.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This current study included 6,280 HCNS participants who met the researchers’ criteria, which included full diet information and cognitive assessments. Researchers also adjusted for demographic information like age, race, sex, BMI, education level, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, the results suggest that several nutrients were connected with a reduced risk of dementia. The five with the strongest association were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Isorhamnetin, a type of flavonol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manganese, a mineral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta-tocopherol and beta-tocotrienol, both forms of vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also adds to the mounting evidence that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high sugar intake&lt;/a&gt; is linked with a higher risk of dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With that said, it also showed some controversial associations between some other nutrients and higher dementia risk. We say controversial because they conflict with previous research or add to mixed results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, this study suggests a link between certain components in milk and an increased risk of dementia, including glycerophosphocholine and vitamin D, both of which have been shown to support brain health in other studies. Researchers note that more research needs to be done, and that it could be due to other components in the food, not necessarily these nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has several limitations. First, asking people to estimate how much they ate of certain foods over the last year leaves lots of room for bias, forgetfulness and guessing. Also, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive abilities and dementia&lt;/a&gt; were not clinically evaluated, which also leaves room for bias. Lastly, researchers did not adjust for factors like genetics and environmental factors that play a role in dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Isorhamnetin is a flavonol found in fruits and vegetables, including onions, almonds, berries, cherries, pears, apples and green grapes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also found in ginkgo biloba, an herb touted for its brain health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ll find manganese in nuts, legumes, whole grains and leafy greens. Maple syrup and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676558/what-is-maple-water-and-should-you-be-drinking-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maple water&lt;/a&gt; are also rich sources of this trace mineral. Manganese plays a role in many bodily processes, including metabolism and immunity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it’s a mineral, manganese plays a dual role and acts like an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage from free radicals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like manganese, vitamin E also has antioxidant properties, protecting cells from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and sunflower and safflower oils are good sources of vitamin E. You’ll also get some in spinach and broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A whopping &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nine out of 10 Americans&lt;/a&gt; don’t have enough fiber in their diets. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned that you’re not including enough of these nutrients in your day-to-day routine, consider shaking things up. An easy (and painless) way to do it is to swap out your typical snacks for nutrient-rich ones. For example, if you typically reach for chips, soda or a candy bar mid-afternoon, consider a handful of nuts and berries. Or how about some hummus and veggie sticks? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The MIND diet is a fusion of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, and is loaded with brain-healthy foods that are also good for your heart. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;There is recent evidence&lt;/a&gt; that following this healthy eating pattern may reduce your risk of dementia by up to 25%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, physical activity, managing your stressors and getting plenty of quality sleep also influence brain health. And make sure you’re also spending time with loved ones, as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loneliness has also been shown to increase dementia &lt;/a&gt;risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that certain nutrients, like vitamin E, manganese and isorhamnetin, all of which act like antioxidants, plus fiber, are linked with a lower risk of dementia. It also adds to existing evidence that high sugar intake may raise dementia risk. If possible, get these brain-protecting nutrients from food. If you have difficulty doing so, seek the advice of a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can help you integrate foods rich in these nutrients and determine if supplementation is a viable option for you.

&lt;p&gt;The unidentified resident returned from a recent trip to Europe with measles, becoming the state’s 15th case this year, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in measles cases in Colorado, the most the state has recorded in decades, comes after a deadly outbreak in Texas this year, and as other hot spots have emerged around the world for the highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected Boulder County resident was an adult who was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Two shots of the vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say people should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days — and consider avoiding public gatherings — if they visited the following exposure locations in Boulder and Denver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTD Flatiron Flyer between Denver and Boulder&lt;/strong&gt;, both ways, from 6:45 to 9:35 a.m. and 4:05 to 7:15 p.m. June 3, June 5 and June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Building&lt;/strong&gt;, 1400 16th St., Denver, from 8 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. June 3-6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Finch Coffee Shop&lt;/strong&gt;, 1490 16th St., Denver, from noon to 2:15 p.m. June 4 and June 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/strong&gt;, 1701 Wewatta St., Denver, from noon to 2:30 p.m. June 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosetta Hall&lt;/strong&gt;, 1109 Walnut St., Boulder, from 7:30 to 10:45 p.m. June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include a cough, runny nose, red eyes and a fever, with a red rash starting about four days after someone becomes contagious. People can begin to feel sick one to three weeks after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who feel ill after a possible exposure should call their health care provider or an urgent care center before seeking help, so the provider can reduce the risk the virus will spread to other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded at least eight measles cases tied to Denver International Airport and a Turkish Airlines flight that landed there with a contagious passenger on May 13. Other cases have been confirmed in Denver, Pueblo and Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;In a typical year, Colorado has two or fewer measles cases. The last time the state recorded more than 10 in a year was in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

That much smaller Y chromosome carries the SRY gene, which is the switch for testis development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 300 million years or so, this system has been working very well. Now, however, chatter in genetics circles hints that something is amiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the Y chromosome has been losing pieces of itself, and computer models suggest the last scraps could vanish in roughly 11 million years. This is no trivial matter, because what it holds – or drops – can sway everything from cancer risk to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mouse-with-two-dads-survives-to-adulthood-major-implications-for-same-sex-human-couples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how future humans reproduce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would that erase men from the planet, or would life simply shrug and invent a new plan? Rodents on remote islands and subtle changes inside aging human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; are now providing clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One story shows how a mammal kept producing males after its Y disappeared entirely. The other warns how men already pay a price when some of their cells drift away from the chromosome during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosome-fade-away"&gt;Y chromosome fade away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-pass-down-x-chromosomes-that-accelerate-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The X chromosome&lt;/a&gt; carries about 900 genes that do everything from wiring nerves to repairing DNA. Its partner, the Y, keeps only about 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparative work across mammals shows that, once our lineage split from the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-do-animals-balance-their-sex-chromosomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt; some 166 million years ago, the Y began dropping about five genes every million years. Run that line forward, and the ledger hits zero in 11 million years – a geological heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most biologists once chalked that outcome up to hype. After all, many species never shed their sex chromosomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea gained traction when researchers found the Japanese spiny rat and a few mole vole species thriving today without any Y at all. Somehow, they had rewired the traditional circuit for making testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rodents-changed-the-rules"&gt;Rodents changed the rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, scientists found a duplicated piece of DNA near a gene called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/sox9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SOX9&lt;/a&gt; in the spiny rat. Usually, another gene (SRY) turns SOX9 on to make male traits develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this rat, the new DNA copy does that job on its own – even without a Y chromosome – so a genetically female animal (XX) can still develop as male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the fragment into lab mice and testes still form. Evolution, it seems, can lay a new cable when the old one burns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That discovery hints that, should the human Y fizzle out one distant day, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifes-rules-natural-selection-change-significantly-often-daphnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt; could promote an alternative trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different populations might even settle on different triggers, eventually splitting into separate species that cannot interbreed. The idea sounds like science fiction, but the rodent reality shows it is genetically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosomes-and-men-s-health"&gt;Y chromosomes and men’s health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before any species-wide overhaul, countless men are already losing the Y chromosome cell by cell. Starting in their fifties, bone-marrow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/living-mouse-created-with-stem-cells-that-predate-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; sometimes mis-segregate it during division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting white-blood-cell lineages, missing their Y, multiply quietly. By 80 years old, more than 40 percent of men carry sizable pockets of this “mosaic loss of Y” in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking 1,153 Swedish men in their seventies and eighties, researchers found that those with the loss died 5.5 years earlier, suffered more solid tumors and heart disease, and faced a seven-fold rise in Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Walsh of the &lt;a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; then bred mouse blood stem cells without the Y chromosome and transplanted them. The recipients developed fibrosis, failing hearts, and early death, showing the loss is the culprit, not a bystander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-direct-link-to-the-immune-system"&gt;Direct link to the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gene on the Y chromosome called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UTY&lt;/a&gt; helps control the immune system. Without it, some immune cells stop working properly – one kind makes more scar tissue, and another becomes weaker, which helps cancer grow and spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, tumors grow twice as fast without the Y. In men, bladder cancers missing the Y chromosome are more dangerous – except they respond better to a certain kind of cancer treatment called checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture is complicated: a chromosome that underpins male development also tames inflammation and restrains tumors, yet its selective absence can make some drugs shine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicine and evolution rarely share the same bottom line. Natural selection prizes reproductive success over a lifetime, while clinicians care about the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-offsetting-y-chromosome-loss"&gt;Offsetting Y chromosome loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution, and certain industrial chemicals add extra DNA damage and accelerate the Y chromosome loss. Kicking tobacco, breathing cleaner air, and limiting exposure to mutagens therefore rank as simple defenses – all it takes is willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General habits that slow genomic wear – regular exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mediterranean-diet-may-be-a-fountain-of-youth-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean-style&lt;/a&gt; meals, and solid sleep – may also keep the Y chromosome in more cells for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifibrotic drugs cleared for lung disease are being tested to blunt heart damage from the loss. Oncologists already use chromosome status in bladder tumors to steer checkpoint therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As single-cell sequencing gets cheaper, your physical exam might soon include a “Y-loss score” beside cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese spiny rat proves that mammals can reinvent the rulebook after the ‘puny little chromosome’ disappears. That prospect keeps evolutionary biologists buzzing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the rodent’s triumph offers little comfort to a 60-year-old man whose marrow has already shed Y in a third of his white-blood-cell army. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Species-level salvation and individual-level hazard can coexist. That dichotomy – long-term adaptability versus immediate personal cost – will likely guide both medical practice and evolutionary debate in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Y chromosome is quirky but crucial. It shapes male development, steadies immunity, and may also be plotting its own disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the good news is that the practical advice is simple: dodge mutagens, stub out cigarettes, consider a mid-life test for loss, and keep an eye on new research as this chromosome writes its final chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go, men, you got this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00646-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 21:55:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPaHBHVUVBUVJoMU5NODVHOGRiMGhSZDBEd2Zrak5rYzVVX0lGOGNlMHloWlhBSGhzamRRZXJtS1M5cU9UM3RGSE9wM0NHWDRZYnZPR3dQRUZ0YVlyTFVqcVdSM0dEUGxpT25LMFh5N2tPVGZDUGp1elJmYjZXMnQybTR4NlJUd3k2d2tnbDloN3Y5TVR1XzZ6bWg0cjM</guid></item><item><title>不同的自闭症基因，相同的大脑特征-神经科学新闻 | Different Autism Genes, Same Brain Signature - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5ta0JKTzF6R0FuZloyZEpRU3JqNHRwdmE0QlpkZzQwUjBlLWtGQUpJTWRlc2lESDhRTUNJd0M5S3ZfREptd3FHS0liSDdIY0J1aS1FaVVaMUc3ZElLWVlQS194QzNZcmVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that different genetic forms of autism may produce a shared brain activity pattern, revealing a potential common neural signature despite distinct genetic origins. Using brain-wide recordings in preclinical models, scientists observed that autism-linked mutations affected how expectations are updated during decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models relied more heavily on frontal brain regions and less on sensory input, struggling to distinguish between predictable and unpredictable stimuli. The findings offer a promising bridge between genetic variation and behavioral traits in autism, opening new paths for targeted research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Brain Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; Distinct autism-linked genes produce similar patterns of brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Processing Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Autism models show impaired flexibility in updating expectations from sensory input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontal Dominance:&lt;/strong&gt; Mutant models relied more on frontal brain regions, less on sensory areas during decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research from the University of Minnesota Medical School suggests that different genetic forms of autism may lead to similar patterns in brain activity and behavior. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110912"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/ASD-genetics-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The particular circuit this research uncovered appears to drive behavioral anomalies in all three preclinical models of autism tested. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain-recording technology, the research team observed neurons across the entire brain to explore whether different genetic forms of autism share patterns and establish commonalities in neural responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that, despite genetic differences, various forms may show a similar unique pattern of brain activity — also known as a brain signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this research will serve as a stepping stone linking genetic differences and behavioral atypicalities,” said Jean-Paul Noel, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that preclinical models with autism-linked genetic mutations struggled to adjust their expectations —or their predicted state of the world in the immediate future — based on new information when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical models that could update their expectations more flexibly, they relied more heavily on the front part of the brain and less on sensory areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, their brains focused more on long-term expectation differences, but their sensory systems had trouble distinguishing between predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particular circuit this research uncovered appears to drive behavioral anomalies in all three preclinical models of autism tested. This feedback projection from frontal areas to visual cortex will be studied in more detail in subsequent projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust, Simons Foundation, National Institutes of Health [grant R00NS128075], a Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative Pilot Grant, the University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute and a Sloan Research fellowship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and Autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f899d58b95918c90b88d9596d69d9c8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexandra Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alexandra Smith – University of Minnesota&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01965-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism&lt;/a&gt;” by Jean-Paul Noel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational psychiatry studies suggest that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inflexibly update their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we leveraged high-yield rodent psychophysics, extensive behavioral modeling and brain-wide single-cell extracellular recordings to assess whether mice with different genetic perturbations associated with ASD show this same computational anomaly, and if so, what neurophysiological features are shared across genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice harboring mutations in &lt;em&gt;Fmr1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shank3B&lt;/em&gt; show a blunted update of priors during decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with mice that flexibly updated their priors, inflexible updating of priors was associated with a shift in the weighting of prior encoding from sensory to frontal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, frontal areas in mouse models of ASD showed more units encoding deviations from the animals’ long-run prior, and sensory responses did not differentiate between expected and unexpected observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that distinct genetic instantiations of ASD may yield common neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

It has also been used in the treatment of malaria and even as an antidote to cyanide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Wellness circles are now claiming the drug is a 'nootropic' - something which enhances cognitive function - which can slow down aging, enhance memory, improve mood and even prevent cancer – none of which appear to have been proven scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Celebrities that have endorsed methylene blue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alongside wellness influencers, methylene blue has also gained several &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Among them is biohacker &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/bryan-johnson"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the guy who spends $2 million a year to reverse aging and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/bryan-johnson-erection-test-viral-son-responds-128278-20250124"&gt;compares erections with his son&lt;/a&gt;, revealed on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1896679614602482042"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; that he had begun to take methylene blue back in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mel Gibson also &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rYtrS5IbrQ"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; on an episode of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/joe-rogan"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;'s podcast a friend of his had used the methylene blue to allegedly cure stage four &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Methylene blue... It was a textile dye. Now they find it has profound effects on your mitochondria," Rogan said after the anecdote, to which Gibson replied: "This stuff works, man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr was even seen putting what appeared to be methylene blue in his drink mid-flight (&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-drinking-flight-methylene-blue-b2693495.html"&gt;via&lt;/a&gt; The Independent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, he was never publicly spoken about using the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we know about how methylene blue affects the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;However there is little evidence to back up the claims (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to one health expert who &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-this-blue-chemical-really-boost-your-brain-heres-what-we-know"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; the topic with Science Direct, methylene blue is able to cross the protective tissue which surrounds the brain and penetrate the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Researchers also believe the dye may also have a positive impact on our mitochondria, something which is referred to as the 'powerhouse' of our cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, it's important to note that most studies regarding the impact of methylene blue on the brain have been conducted on rodents, meaning there's little evidence of benefits for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There are also numerous risks to taking methylene blue, with neuroscientist Anne-Sophie Fluri &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14795783/doctors-verdict-longevity-elixir-Joe-Rogan-RFK-Jr-swear-reverses-aging.html"&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; MailOnline: “Without solid evidence in humans, these claims are at best speculative and at worst potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The brain is not a machine you can casually 'optimise' like a smartphone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Taking too high a dose of methylene blue and you find yourself at risk of developing conditions such as serotonin syndrome – something which Johnson directly acknowledged when revealing he was using the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 20:01:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNdHpYZmFFQmNVSy02XzZnUmtkZHRLaDczMnlYaXJXYUZYc01tNHJlNXp2eDBvbkY4Z251M25KRWRCTWY5RFZDUmt3TkpRM1U2dFNMYnVUNU1zYUZoNWpLb0lWb1hwc0R1SW14OEx2M2J1TTdUY1B4dHpNWHkxT0lCOUZteWxBSVl5RzF3RHZjMzNOalFGR2YtUlNvM2lXQQ</guid></item><item><title>专家说，肯尼迪的HHS派国会“垃圾科学”来捍卫疫苗的变化- CNN | Kennedy’s HHS sent Congress ‘junk science’ to defend vaccine changes, experts say - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5TbnlwUWpFZlZYbHVOSEg2dHlyTHQ2UWVqRVpxWlYyRTUtSHMwQ3VtcExTd3ptclpWdS1JUXpiSzVQS2tGSGZ6bVZBV05ZeVBVMXJ0N0ItMkxGdWM5R3BTeFptcVBGVE5pR0dTSGJfXzE0RU9jNlZyYjB6ckI1M0nSAYQBQVVfeXFMTWlNbXNEckRFbkhMTE9tWHlJWklYbFdzcm1DX19mSFZhc1YwUGgyUVBfUFZ6SUZTbXExMVFwS1pDblhaWUJJT3hjVWFibGgxTU5SU29lT1lLRldDMkt4MF90cG1YQUlmcmI1M084ZXhNcmlpbUc3TUFuNE1oeFBVdWtWanYx?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A document the Department of Health and Human Services sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to change U.S. policy on covid vaccines cites scientific studies that are unpublished or under dispute and mischaracterizes others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k00073b6mvrtqb6hu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One health expert called the document “willful medical disinformation” about the safety of covid vaccines for children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it’s just not there,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mark-turrentine-32066" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Turrentine&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the Trump administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency’s formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The HHS document meant to support Kennedy’s decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress who questioned the science and process behind his move, according to one federal official who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000b3b6mxulzu6ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy’s announcement from the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000c3b6m9b37tiyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Titled “Covid Recommendation FAQ,” the document distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished, medical experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News, “There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Under the study’s title is an alert that “it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.” Though the preprint was made available a year ago, it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The FAQ supporting Kennedy’s decision claims that “post-marketing studies” of covid vaccines have identified “serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis” — conditions in which the heart’s muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000m3b6mytcf69j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            False claims that the 2024 preprint showed myocarditis and pericarditis only in people who received a covid vaccine, and not in people infected with covid, circulated on social media. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;study’s co-authors&lt;/a&gt; publicly rejected that idea, because the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the covid virus. The study also focused only on children and adolescents. The HHS document omitted numerous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993236/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is greater after contracting covid for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000n3b6m5va2ty2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the covid pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of covid vaccines were spaced further apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000o3b6m8x16x1hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O’Leary said, referring to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found “an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.” But the paper doesn’t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000r3b6m8l7lpzj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere,” said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If he were grading the HHS document, “I would give this an ‘F,’” Turrentine said. “This is not supported by anything and it’s not using medical evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000t3b6mahkdmtpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “They’re going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document,” Silverman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000u3b6m1utygbdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Schrier’s office did receive a copy of the document.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000v3b6m04p2ohkp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don’t have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart,” O’Leary said. “But this one — I’ve seen much better anti-vaccine propaganda than this, frankly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000w3b6mwahzdy4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration’s policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000x3b6mxxuyaefn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This feels like it’s breaking new ground. I don’t think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration,” Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000y3b6m683xobr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On June 4, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Schrier &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr3701/BILLS-119hr3701ih.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would require Kennedy to adopt official vaccine decisions from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Young said the motivation behind the bill was Kennedy’s decision to change the covid vaccine schedule without the input of ACIP’s vaccine experts, who play a key role in setting CDC policies around vaccine schedules and access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000z3b6mkvy7hltk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy announced June 9 on X that he would remove all 17 members of ACIP, citing alleged conflicts of interest he did not detail, and replace them. He announced eight replacements June 11, including people who had criticized vaccine mandates during the covid pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

I asked if he could feel it, if he was doing anything to make it twitch, but he said no,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spasms progressed for Albaladejo and he soon experienced arm weakness, difficulty gripping things, and high blood pressure, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.newsweek.com/silly-little-symptom-leads-als-diagnosis-2083556?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawK5DRlleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFNUG40ZWN2eG9uVmJDSFFzAR4GYdlcSt9DsIH1gC5T3EZCSbd3f9-elZ3QsLIAmEvjc_Me_P2lo0dGdQHBeA_aem_BmKQCgWPBSYsySYL3Yg2tA#Echobox=1749744873" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Newsweek;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; reported. Within months, doctors diagnosed him with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, a condition that causes progressive &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:loss of muscle control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;loss of muscle control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was heartbroken when I heard the news, like my life was being taken from me piece by piece – I still have so much of me to give,” he told DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hearing the diagnosis was devastating, we were in complete shock,” Carmen said to Newsweek. “Sitting in that doctor's office, the weight of it all hit us at once. We broke down in tears. It was one of the hardest moments of our lives, filled with fear, sorrow, and so many unanswered questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Physical therapy (stock photo).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALS symptoms can include difficulty walking, tripping, and slurred speech, among others, and it often first appears in the hands, feet, arms, or legs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. There is no cure, but medical treatment can slow the disease's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life changed in an instant for Albaladejo, who used to work as a school resource officer, and he worried about his family’s future, including his 11-year-old daughter Sophia. He was 39 years old when he received the diagnosis in late 2023, according to Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm angry that I won't be here to see my little girl grow into the smart, kind, and beautiful woman I know she will be. I think that hurts the most,” Albaladejo said. “Instead, she has to watch me fall apart in front of her eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he wants to leave a legacy she can be proud of.  “I just hope that throughout all of this, my daughter still sees me as her hero, as I face this disease with determination and strength,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily life in Tampa has shifted drastically for the couple, who &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@calbaladej0/photo/7402335127734390062" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:started dating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;started dating&lt;/a&gt; when they were teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In eight months, our lives completely changed. We thought it was nerve compression, and now Albaladejo has a terminal illness with a prognosis of two to five years,” Carmen told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Newsweek, Albaladejo relies on a wheelchair to get around and Carmen has become her husband’s primary caregiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To see someone go from being completely independent to nearly fully dependent in under two years is truly heartbreaking," she told Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmen has been documenting the &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@calbaladej0/video/7514004486549998894" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family’s journey on TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family’s journey on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and Albaladejo’s sister started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-andres-albaladejos-fight-against-als?utm_campaign=fp_ss_icons_ai&amp;amp;utm_content=amp1v3&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; that has already raised more than $26,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a cruel condition that robs a person of their vitality, strength and mobility,” Carmen wrote online in 2024. “It’s been a rough year for us and even through it all, we still do what we can to just live life every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s no cure, the Albaladejo family is pressing forward as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we are getting our affairs in order, as we cannot see any promising treatments we can afford,” Carmen told the Daily Mail. “We are trying to stay strong and make the best out of our situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/florida-father-has-1-minor-symptom-before-he-s-given-2-years-to-live-11754248" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 18:35:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBwVjRpODQtc2RRdlJEbXNNQ2taWEM1OG9xb0V4bW13NXIzWDM3OE1YYUlsdTB1Qm9PYnh1eUlnMjVQYVpsamlsRVZTQWpWeWM0MlRFWVpUbGxkcXF2WlV3eTJRRkY0cVExWlBITA</guid></item><item><title>科学家们精确地指出了检查您是否会患上早发性结肠癌的方法，准确率高达92 ％ -每日邮报 | Scientists pinpoint way to check if you're going to get early-onset colon cancer with up to 92% accuracy - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little-known at-home test can detect early-onset colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5395ccd0-485d-11f0-a3cb-3b7d494b4c7b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; before symptoms develop, increasing the chance of surviving a disease that is surging among young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) costs $49 and screens a person's feces for flecks of blood, a warning sign of the cancer — as tumors cause bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test is FDA-approved and allows younger people a chance to screen for colon cancer before they reach the recommended age for a colonoscopy, 45 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If blood is detected, a colonoscopy is performed, increasing the chances of catching colon cancer early when it is more treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the American College of Surgeons says it is generally accurate, able to detect about 80 percent of all cases. If someone opts for the $600 FIT with DNA screening, which checks for abnormal changes in cells' DNA, accuracy rises to 92 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is about 99 percent accurate at detecting all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study found people that use the FIT method between the ages of 40 to 49 years old are 39 percent less likely to die from colon cancer than their peers who wait to get the test until they are 50 years old or above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An increasing number of younger people are seeking screening, as the US experiences a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14797635/colon-cancer-young-people-symptoms.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer among people under 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, with young patients today about twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease than their grandparents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Christine Bronstein who was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 48 years after taking an at-home stool-based test for the disease. She said without the test, her cancer may have gone unnoticed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rising rates are prompting some physicians to urge Americans to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;start getting screened for the disease &lt;/a&gt;before the age of 45 years, which is when US doctors recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the test, which can be ordered online, customers are sent a package containing a collection tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are asked to collect a sample of their feces from the toilet bowl, place it in the tube and mail it to a lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results take about five days to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the lab, scientists expose the feces to antibodies that can bind to human hemoglobin - a protein found in red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they bind to an area of the feces, a positive test result is issued - and patients are advised to undertake further screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the FIT with DNA, scientists also analyze cells found in the stool for abnormal changes - which could indicate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients over 45 years old who have an average risk — meaning no family history of the disease — may be recommended the test, which is free for the group under health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But people can also buy the test, which is sold by labs like Everlywell for $49, or opt for other tests like Cologuard, which is priced at $121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the test can be extremely helpful, doctors caution that about five to 10 percent of patients who get a positive result do not have colon cancer or advanced polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of false positives after a colonoscopy is below one percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important to follow up with a doctor to discuss results.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with stage three cancer following the test, and a two-inch tumor was found in her rectum. She underwent chemotherapy to shrink her tumor (shown above) before doctors said they would remove it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is a stock image of the FIT, which involves sending a sample of feces off to a lab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients undertaking the test are recommended to do it every year, as this can help to catch early-onset cancers which are typically slower growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among patients to have their cancer caught after using an at-home stool-based test is Christine Bronstein, who was diagnosed with the cancer at age 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hawaii local exercises regularly, and avoids sugar and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after seeing blood in her stool in 2021, she became concerned and ordered a stool-based test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After results came back positive, she rushed to see her doctor and was eventually approved for a colonoscopy - which led to a stage three colon cancer diagnosis with a two-inch tumor found in her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bronstein told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/health/colorectal-cancer-survivor-home-test-rcna25564"&gt;TODAY&lt;/a&gt;: 'I'm very lucky that I did my test when I did. This thing really takes people down right in their prime... I think the problem why this is becoming the No.1 killer for younger people is because their symptoms get denied.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer cases are surging among under-50s in the US in an uptick that has stunned researchers, with adults born in the 1980s having double the risk of suffering from the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among adults aged 25 to 29 years, colon cancer cancer rates have spiked 85 percent in two decades according to CDC data. At the same time, over the last 30 years cases have dropped among over-50s by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, sun exposure carries a risk of skin cancer, and experts recommend getting vitamin D through diet or supplements instead.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're using sunscreen and plan to be outside anyway, brief sun exposure may help with vitamin D production. Research shows that about 10 minutes of midday sun with 25% of the body exposed—such as the arms and legs—can meet daily vitamin D needs during spring and summer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The sun is not a dependable source to ensure you have enough vitamin D,” &lt;a href="https://mdinseattle.com/about-modern-dermatology/our-physicians/heather-d-rogers-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Heather D. Rogers, MD,&lt;/a&gt; a dermatologist in Seattle, told Verywell. “The safest and most consistent way to get adequate vitamin D is through your diet—eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D–rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, choosing fortified options, and using supplements as needed.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although experts advise against relying on sun exposure for all your vitamin D needs, this doesn't mean you should avoid sunlight altogether. Even with sunscreen, your body may still produce some vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Not having enough sun exposure can contribute to increased anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and greater difficulty managing everyday stressors,” said &lt;a href="https://dignuswellness.com/AboutMe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samia Estrada, PsyD&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist based in Vacaville, CA. “Getting sun while also exercising has been found to have a favorable impact on stress management.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D’s primary role is to help the body absorb calcium from the intestines, which helps strengthen your bones, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/karl-insogna/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Karl Insogna, MD,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;director of the Yale Bone Center at Yale Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Insgona said both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-two-vs-d-three-7095309" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D2 and D3&lt;/a&gt; naturally occur in foods such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, beef liver, and egg yolks. But because most people don’t eat enough of these foods, many products—including milk, certain cereals, and some orange juice brands—have been fortified with vitamin D.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is measured in international units (IU). The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended daily intake&lt;/a&gt; is 600 IU for ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for those 71 and older.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the National Institutes of Health, most people in the United States have adequate blood levels of vitamin D, but about 25% do not. As you age, your skin becomes less efficient at producing vitamin D, which may increase your need for supplements or vitamin D–rich foods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently states that there isn’t enough evidence to recommend for or against routine vitamin D testing in people without symptoms of a deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The program aims to offer therapeutic support in a safe, medically supervised setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open to the public following a soft launch earlier this year, this &lt;a href="https://ambio.life/personal-change/ibogaine-regeneration/"&gt;neuroregenerative program&lt;/a&gt; is designed for patients considering ibogaine as part of their care strategy. It has already treated 30 patients in a dedicated treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to MS, the program is available for people with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions. The goal is to explore ibogaine as a potential supportive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re creating a safe, structured environment for people with these conditions to explore ibogaine, and we could be on the cusp of uncovering how ibogaine may support brain healing in ways we don’t fully understand today,” Jonathan Dickinson, Ambio’s CEO and co-founder, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/09/3095856/0/en/Ambio-Life-Sciences-Launches-World-s-First-Clinical-Ibogaine-Program-for-Patients-With-Neurodegenerative-Conditions.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Lesion volume reduced, symptoms eased in 2 patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, damage to the brain and spinal cord results in a wide range of symptoms, including vision problems, poor coordination and balance, fatigue, and pain. Available treatments can prevent new damage from occurring and slow down the progression of disease, but they generally cannot help patients regain lost functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibogaine, currently illegal in the U.S., is a psychedelic found in the root bark of the African iboga plant. It works by acting on receptors — for example, NMDA and opioid receptors — that play a role in brain activity. Ibogaine also increases the production of molecules that help nerve cells survive and form new connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;As both a clinician and an MS patient, I’ve experienced the complexity of these conditions and the limitations of traditional treatments. The relief some patients are reporting so far is motivating, including improvements in eyesight, mobility, and neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1535782/full"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt;, ibogaine reduced lesion volume and eased symptoms of MS in two patients — one with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing–remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; and the other with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. Following treatment, both patients also showed signs of improvement on brain scans suggestive of new connections between nerve cells and rewiring of brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As both a clinician and an MS patient, I’ve experienced the complexity of these conditions and the limitations of traditional treatments,” Lyndsey Ryan, Ambio’s chief therapy officer, said. “The relief some patients are reporting so far is motivating, including improvements in eyesight, mobility, and neuropathic pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ambio’s program, a loading dosing is optimized for tolerability, followed by extended microdosing (taking very small doses). Weekly group sessions offer ongoing support through and beyond the treatment period. In addition to providing safe access to ibogaine, the company will also collect real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the program does not promise a cure, it gives patients a chance to participate in an emerging therapy that could support better quality of life and provide insights for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every participant is helping us learn what’s possible,” said Ryan, who is also the program’s lead therapist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Ibogaine relived ‘MS hug’ for patient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country music artist Clay Walker and NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre were among the first to try the program. Both were diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases — Walker with MS in 1996, and Favre with Parkinson’s in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was told about ibogaine from a friend who completed the treatment and was blown away by the results,” said Favre. “Since coming to Ambio, I’ve felt a real shift, especially in my sleep and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker shared a similar experience. “My journey with ibogaine was extraordinary,” Walker said. “It relieved what we call the ‘&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/the-ms-hug/"&gt;MS hug&lt;/a&gt;,’ that painful tightness in the abdomen, and gave me clarity, focus, and real relief from stress. My hope is that ibogaine can one day complement the treatments MS patients already rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambio is working with Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, to explore how ibogaine works in people with neurodegenerative diseases, namely how it impacts biomarkers of neuroinflammation and disease models of Parkinson’s, MS, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This work may help define what ibogaine treatments for neurodegenerative diseases could look like in the future,” Dickinson said. “Even if we don’t fully know what shape that will take yet, preclinical research and each patient’s experience brings us closer to understanding how ibogaine may support neurorepair.”&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a commonly prescribed stimulant that Declan had been taking for years. As Sarah tells PEOPLE, her husband, David, was about to give him the medication, which they’d picked up from Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy in Comox, B.C., on May 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very chaotic in the morning, and if my husband had just been distracted with the other two, or been tired from being up with the baby the night before, this could have ended totally differently," Sarah, who has a 3-year-old and 10-month-old, tells PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty; Joe Amon/The Denver Post via Getty&lt;/p&gt; (Left:) Dextroamphetamine; (Right:) Hydromorphone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when David looked at the bottle, and realized he was holding someone else’s prescription — and it was for hydromorphone.

&lt;p&gt;Dental implants have gotten much better, but they still just sit there, in your mouth, like polished pegs. Your real teeth — you can feel them chatter, grind, and push onto stuff. When you chew, you feel it with your tiny nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, this sensory feedback — known as dental proprioception — has been lost to implants. Until now. A team from Tufts University has just unveiled a bioengineered dental implant that doesn’t just fill the gap but also blends in with your sensory connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-750x600.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1140x912.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-750x600.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1140x912.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-285357 sp-no-webp" alt="teeth" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Teeth implants could use stem cells and connect to nerve endings inside your mouth. Image credits: Kamal Hoseinianzade.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, let’s get something straight: traditional implants are mechanical marvels. Typically made of titanium and topped with ceramic, they’re surgically anchored directly into your jawbone. Once healed, they stay put for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the problem: in anchoring directly to the bone, implants bypass the soft tissue that naturally connects real teeth to your jaw. That soft tissue — the periodontal ligament — is loaded with nerve endings. It lets you feel the difference between a walnut and a jellybean. Lose it, and you lose that whisper of feedback that makes chewing precise and speech fluid. It’s a bit like having &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="2305" href="https://www.zmescience.com/future/ai-headphones-focusing/"&gt;noise-cancelling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers want to bring back the feel of &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/researchers-develop-new-coating-that-could-remove-teeth-stains-more-effectively/"&gt;real teeth&lt;/a&gt; with a new generation of implants. They’ve designed an implant wrapped in a biodegradable, memory-foam-like nanofiber coating. Inside that coating are stem cells and a potent growth protein (FGF-2). This protein nudges those cells to become nerve tissue and directs the implant to grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea is to re-create the missing nerve link — the feedback loop that once kept your bite in sync. But the team didn’t stop at making the implant feel more natural. They changed how it’s installed, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-changing-dental-implants"&gt;Changing dental implants&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional implants require drilling into the jawbone — a procedure that is painful, can damage nerves, and takes months to fully heal. The Tufts implant, by contrast, uses a “press-fit” technique. Think of it like inserting a memory foam plug: it goes in smaller than the space it’s meant to fill, then slowly expands to snugly match the contours of the socket. You don’t need any drills and there’s less trauma involved with the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the method has only been tested on rats, not on humans. Six weeks after the implants were installed, they were still secure and showed no sign of rejection. &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/how-water-filters-age/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2304"&gt;Micro-CT scans&lt;/a&gt; showed that a tiny, uniform gap (0.7–0.9 mm) exists between the implant and the surrounding bone. Instead of fusing directly to bone like traditional implants, these sit within a soft-tissue pocket. That’s the magic: that soft-tissue layer is where the nerve connections are expected to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to see if those newly grown nerves actually &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; — by measuring &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="2303" href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/brain-solves-problems-when-we-daydream/"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; in response to bite pressure or temperature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that checks out, the team plans to move on to larger animal models — likely pigs or dogs, which have more &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/fossil-friday-the-story-of-how-tusks-evolved-from-teeth/"&gt;human-like teeth&lt;/a&gt; — and eventually clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-game-changer-for-dentistry"&gt;A game changer for dentistry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect to see this technology pop up at a dentist near you in a year or two. But if this does work, it could be a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 178 million Americans are missing at least one tooth. By 2026, nearly a quarter of the U.S. population is expected to have at least one dental implant. Worldwide, the implant industry is projected to top $13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new implants are not just about comfort, either. Without proprioception, patients often bite harder than they need to, risking fractures or jaw issues. Subtle speech changes can occur. The feedback loop between jaw muscles, teeth, and brain is broken. And we’re only beginning to understand how that affects digestion, eating behavior, and long-term oral health. Some researchers even link impaired oral sensation to changes in brain regions tied to speech, swallowing, and memory. It’s a frontier in neuroscience and prosthodontics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only exciting discovery in the field. In Japan, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/the-first-drug-that-regrows-teeth-is-about-to-enter-clinical-trials/"&gt;have made progress&lt;/a&gt; on regrowing human teeth. Another approach aims to &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/human-like-teeth-grown-in-pigs-could-make-dental-implants-a-thing-of-the-past/"&gt;regrow human teeth in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. But these approaches will take quite some time to develop as well, if they turn out to be successful at all. In the meantime, it looks like we’ll still be using implants for some time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These implants may soon become much more than just plumbing and scaffolding. They will be part of a sensing, communicating, adapting system. This smart implant doesn’t just restore function — it tries to connect an implant to the body. Literally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99923-8"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The compound, called JRT, showed strong potential to promote brain cell growth and reverse damage linked to conditions like schizophrenia. In animal experiments, JRT improved symptoms without triggering behaviors associated with hallucinations. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416106122" target="_blank"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, is best known for its powerful mind-altering effects. But in recent years, researchers have discovered that LSD and similar compounds can also promote neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to grow new connections and repair damaged circuits. This effect makes psychedelics appealing as potential treatments for mood and cognitive disorders, including depression, substance use, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, their hallucinogenic properties pose risks for certain groups, especially people with schizophrenia or a family history of psychosis. Because of this, researchers have been exploring ways to preserve the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics without inducing hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the hallmarks of schizophrenia is atrophy of neurons in the cortex,” explained lead author David E. Olson, director of the &lt;a href="https://neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;UC Davis Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics&lt;/a&gt;. “Psychedelics like LSD are extremely good at promoting cortical neuron growth, but they are typically contraindicated for patients with schizophrenia or a family history of psychosis. We decided to engineer an analogue of LSD with lower hallucinogenic potential in the hopes that this neuroplasticity-promoting compound might be useful for treating these patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the UC Davis team aimed to modify LSD’s structure in a way that would reduce its hallucinogenic potential while maintaining its effects on brain plasticity. They focused on the idea that small changes in a drug’s shape can have big effects on how it interacts with brain receptors. Specifically, they made a tiny adjustment—flipping the position of just two atoms in LSD’s molecular structure. This new version, JRT, turned out to bind to many of the same serotonin receptors as LSD but with a different pharmacological profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot synthesize JRT from LSD or any of the precursors used to make LSD,” Olson said. “We needed to synthesize JRT from scratch. Also, JRT was named after Jeremy R. Tuck, the graduate student who first synthesized it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test JRT’s effects, the researchers conducted a series of experiments, beginning with extensive chemical synthesis and molecular modeling. They confirmed through computer simulations and lab tests that JRT could still interact with serotonin receptors in a way that supports neuroplasticity, but without triggering the signaling pathways that typically lead to hallucinations. Notably, JRT lacked a specific chemical bond (called the indole N–H bond) that LSD uses to form a key interaction in the serotonin 2A receptor—an interaction believed to play a role in producing hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments using rat cortical neurons to examine how JRT affected neuronal growth. Compared to control treatments and existing drugs like clozapine, JRT promoted substantial growth in dendritic branches and spine density—hallmarks of healthy brain connectivity. These effects were even greater than those produced by LSD in the same tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team followed up with &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; studies using mice. A single dose of JRT led to a 46% increase in dendritic spine density and an 18% increase in synapse density in the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in decision-making and emotional regulation. In another experiment, the researchers showed that JRT could reverse the loss of dendritic spines induced by chronic stress, suggesting its potential to restore brain structure in conditions marked by cortical atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether JRT produced psychedelic-like behaviors, the scientists used a behavioral test called the head-twitch response in mice, which correlates with hallucinogenic activity in humans. Unlike LSD, JRT did not trigger the head-twitch response. In fact, it blocked the head-twitch response when mice were given LSD. JRT also did not impair prepulse inhibition—a measure of sensory gating that is often disrupted in schizophrenia and can be worsened by psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed how JRT affected gene expression in the brain. After a single dose, they found that JRT did not induce gene expression changes associated with schizophrenia, while LSD did. This suggests that JRT is less likely to exacerbate symptoms or increase risk in individuals predisposed to psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JRT’s effects on behavior were also promising. In rodent tests commonly used to model depression, including the forced swim test and sucrose preference test, JRT produced antidepressant-like outcomes. The animals were more active and showed restored interest in pleasurable activities after being treated with JRT. These effects were sustained even when the animals continued to experience stress, indicating that JRT’s impact on mood and motivation might be long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, JRT improved performance on a cognitive flexibility task in mice subjected to unpredictable stress. The compound helped the animals learn and adapt when the rules of the task changed, an ability that is often impaired in individuals with schizophrenia and mood disorders. This suggests that JRT may help address cognitive symptoms, which are among the most disabling and treatment-resistant aspects of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that JRT was highly selective for serotonin receptors and lacked affinity for other receptor types—such as dopamine, histamine, or adrenergic receptors—that are often linked to side effects in psychiatric medications. This specificity might make JRT safer and better tolerated than drugs like clozapine, which, while effective, often cause weight gain, sedation, and metabolic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised that transposing only two atoms was sufficient to drastically change the pharmacology of LSD,” Olson told PsyPost. “Not only did it lower hallucinogenic potential, it also improved selectivity across a wide range of targets in the brain. While psychedelics might have therapeutic properties, they were never engineered to be drugs for central nervous system disorders. Even small chemical alterations to the structures of psychedelics have the potential to profoundly improve their safety and efficacy profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the study does have limitations. All experiments were conducted in animals, and it remains to be seen how well the findings will translate to humans. Although JRT appears to be non-hallucinogenic in rodents, human subjective experiences can differ and will need to be tested in clinical trials. The long-term safety of JRT, especially in vulnerable populations, also needs to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the moment, JRT has not yet been tested in humans, but we are working towards this goal,” Olson noted. “I would also like to test JRT in other disease models. In particular, I’m very excited about its potential to rescue neuronal atrophy in neurodegenerative conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416106122" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular design of a therapeutic LSD analogue with reduced hallucinogenic potential&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jeremy R.

&lt;p&gt;Sudden narrowing of the coronary arteries, known as coronary artery spasms, can cause chest pain (angina), heart attacks, and other serious cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. Kento Yoshioka, Dr. Keisuke Obara, and Professor Yoshio Tanaka from the Department of Chemical Pharmacology at Toho University’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences has discovered that ferulic acid, a natural compound found in rice, coffee, and certain vegetables, can help prevent these spasms through two separate mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discovery using pig artery models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used porcine (pig) coronary arteries, which closely resemble human heart arteries, and found that ferulic acid significantly reduced artery contractions caused by chemical stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_479847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-479847" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-479847" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-777x581.jpg" alt="Diagram Showing How Ferulic Acid Prevents Coronary Artery Spasms" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-777x581.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-400x299.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-768x575.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-150x112.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-450x337.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms-1200x898.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Diagram-Showing-How-Ferulic-Acid-Prevents-Coronary-Artery-Spasms.jpg 1454w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-479847" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ferulic acid blocks calcium from entering muscle cells through L-type calcium channels, which normally cause the arteries to contract.

Credit: Kento Yoshioka&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study revealed two key actions of ferulic acid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It blocks calcium from entering muscle cells through L-type calcium channels, which are normally responsible for causing the arteries to contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when calcium is not involved, it still prevents the arteries from tightening by inhibiting the activation of a specific protein called myosin light chain, which is essential for muscle contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comparison to existing treatments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, ferulic acid was sometimes even more effective than diltiazem, a widely used medication for relaxing blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because ferulic acid is plant-based and considered safe, it may have potential as a health food ingredient or even as a foundation for future heart medications,” said lead researcher Dr. Kento Yoshioka.&lt;br&gt;
This research opens the door to new, natural ways of supporting heart health—possibly through diet or supplements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Canada have found that anxiety could be a key warning sign that a cat is at risk of developing a disease known as &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/feline-idiopathic-cystitis-fic-cats"&gt;feline idiopathic cystitis&lt;/a&gt; (FIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being idiopathic, the cause of FIC is currently a mystery. Yet the discovery of heightened skittishness in kitties with recurrent forms of the condition might be the evidence scientists need to understand the pathology and its triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of FIC tend to mimic those of a typical lower urinary tract infection. Affected cats may strain to urinate, pee in small amounts more frequently, or vocalize their discomfort while using the litter box. In more severe cases, their urine may even contain blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike bacterial infections, however, urine samples from cats with FIC are sterile. Vets will usually rule out infection and other causes before landing on FIC as a likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of all cats unfortunate enough to receive a diagnosis will experience the disease again at some point in their life. And given one in five cats with recurring FIC are eventually put to rest by their owners, a means of distinguishing the illness from other conditions might go a long way to saving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cats-can-have-a-profound-effect-on-your-physical-and-mental-health"&gt;our beloved cats&lt;/a&gt; from ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164697" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox.jpg" alt="cat looking scared in a litter box" class="size-full wp-image-164697" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164697" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heightened skittishness in kitties with recurrent forms of FIC might be the evidence scientists need to understand the pathology and its triggers. (Kitzzeh/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some cats end up being euthanized because of it," &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/06/10/anxious-cats-prone-to-recurring-cystitis/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; zoological medical scientist Marion Desmarchelier from the University of Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The disease itself is not fatal, but the cost of repeated emergency treatments can be too much for some families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.900847/full"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; the condition's roots may be found in the nexus between the body's hormonal and nervous systems. Specifically, in an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022534705652536"&gt;imbalance between&lt;/a&gt; stimulations and responses related to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline"&gt;neurotransmitter adrenaline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The going theory suggests an exaggerated dumping of adrenaline damages junctions in the bladder's wall, exposing sensory nerves that cause pain and trigger inflammation. If the poor moggy lacks an ability to tune down their adrenal response because of the damage, they just might expect episodes of discomfort to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full picture is still unclear, the role of adrenaline points to a psychological component – perhaps not just as a red flag for FIC, but a cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164617" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642.jpg" alt="scared cat behind a door" class="wp-image-164617 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164617" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scaredy cats might be a sign of bladder damage. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEQIkC4nC4/"&gt;Serhii Semenovych/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team contacted owners of cats diagnosed with FIC during the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="164614" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and asked them to fill out a questionnaire on their cat's behavior, potential recurrences of the disease, and whether they complied with certain environmental recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 33 surveys that were returned, the scientists noticed a clear difference between cats who had experienced just one instance of FIC and those with recurrences – just over half of the one-offs were reported to be skittish around strangers, compared with nearly all of those with repeat episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A range of other behaviors could be ruled out as related, including aggression on behalf of the cats or whether they themselves were victims of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We initially thought that anxious, aggressive cats would be more prone to recurrent cystitis, but it's actually the fearful, withdrawn ones that seem to be at greater risk," &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/06/10/anxious-cats-prone-to-recurring-cystitis/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Desmarchelier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest FIC be seen more as a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vet-shares-5-simple-tips-to-keep-your-cat-happy-and-healthy"&gt;a cat's mental well-being&lt;/a&gt; rather than a bladder condition. Helping anxious cats feel calm and safe just might reduce their risk of inflammation in their urinary tract, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612X18774437"&gt;Calming tactics include&lt;/a&gt; ensuring your cat has access to multiple safe hiding places they can use to escape other household members when they desire. Pheromone therapy can also help lower their stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could provide crucial evidence that helps pinpoint how a cat's anxiety and comfort in their home affect functions as seemingly unrelated as their ability to urinate comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pet owners are encouraged to pay close attention to their cat companions when company is around and help them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-genetic-mystery-of-why-cats-purr-may-finally-be-solved"&gt;feel at ease&lt;/a&gt;. Their anxiety could be having a bigger effect on them than we ever realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2025.02.005"&gt;Journal of Veterinary Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"However that weight can come from fat and muscle. It’s vital to also perform weight-bearing activities like strength training to preserve muscle and keep your metabolism up while focusing on fat loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19855335/" target="_blank"&gt;(research-backed) rule of thumb&lt;/a&gt; that for the best fat burning potential, you should aim to reach somewhere between 67.6 and 87.1% of your max heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At too high an &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/best-hiit-workouts" target="_blank"&gt;intensity workout&lt;/a&gt; the human body burns more sugar than fat,” Maritato says. “At too low an intensity workout the body burns mostly fat, but not enough to make a measurable difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up: the best fat burning exercises incorporate big muscle groups, will get you mildly sweaty and your heart pumping at a healthy rate. Twenty minutes focused on the below circuit (with an eye on your heart rate) will have the fat melting away, and provide the added bonus of getting your abs sculpted. Don't know where to start? Below are a list of exercises to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burpees – 60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start in a plank position with arms extended. Jump your feet forward so you can stand up straight. Jump on the spot, and return to your starting position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plank Crunches – 60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get into a plank position.

While further research is needed, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28675945/" target="_blank"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests gut inflammation is linked to fat gain and difficulty burning fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there's no single solution for each individual person, but a good way to start is by ensuring your &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-diet-for-longevity-1#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBasically%2C%20you%20want%20to%20eat,%2C%20legumes%2C%20and%20seeds.%E2%80%9D"&gt;diet is made up of ‘whole foods’&lt;/a&gt;: fresh fruit and veg, lean meats and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have also shown that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335476/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep can help regulate metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the latest data available, the FDA reported 1,264 cases of BIA-ALCL and 63 deaths in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For their study, published in the journal Blood Advances, researchers &lt;span&gt;followed 3,000 breast cancer survivors at MSKCC who had breast implants after a double mastectomy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Double mastectomies are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14460739/breanna-bortner-dog-sniffed-cancer-saved-life-minnesota.html"&gt;meant to stop breast cancer from spreading&lt;/a&gt; to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 520 were tested for BRCA mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About eight percent of patients, 43, who were tested for BRCA mutations ended up being carriers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After following the women for 12 years on average, the researchers found those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations had a 16-fold increased risk of BIA-ALCL. They also found women with BIA-ALCL were 'significantly' more likely to have BRCA mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gione said: 'Our findings show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are a significant risk factor for developing this type of lymphoma, confirming earlier suggestions of a possible role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s possible that implant-associated lymphoma is yet another cancer that can arise because of these genetic mutations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers said while BIA-ALCL is still rare, women with BRCA mutations should be cautious before receiving textured breast implants (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast implants with textured surfaces, which can feel like sandpaper, are thought to create space where bacteria can accumulate and form biofilms, or collections of micro-organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These harmful biofilms can trigger an inflammatory response, which damages DNA and causes cells to mutate into cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone in some implants may also lead to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the risk of BIA-ALCL is so low, the FDA doesn't recommend having textured implants removed unless women experience symptoms, which include pain, lumps, swelling or unexpected changes in breast shape.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghione said: 'The implants that are put in place now are theoretically safe; however, there are still a lot of women who are living with textured breast implants, so it’s important that women know what implants they have and talk with their doctor and remember to report this surgery as part of their medical history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:53:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOZ0tURkxDN01rRVU0a2hPNGV4MnlxcVRfUHY0N1Fsbmd2eEZvZXJxOUwtYWpRMEVKUUx5TlJaT2pjSkwwam83TDc5d2ZPU1R3YlZrMkE4eDdCVFJ4bzdDVTlsNnZkVUloelpwSWJEZExnYnpuOTJJa0Zad0VtNkhGQThHVzlKQUtzVWo5RWtFWmlyMFMtcWpSWFdlN3TSAaIBQVVfeXFMTmI3dlk1VEJ1ZjZSR3ZSY0h3TjdnQldac2VyTUk3YkNpb0pyTmV3dWs3eUxWN3dkRURRZWxydWZkYTd3SGpYUVJSM3NJTjc0cVAwaklsY3lNanMyV2lFdFQ0UFg4OEctLUlmQldKaUx0VW53UjlwcWxuTHhmX2xaaURqdXlPMlhCSjBYYlB5bmwwRkdWWDNSbmhsWHJZQUtVTDd3</guid></item><item><title>水果和蔬菜提高睡眠质量-神经科学新闻 | Fruits and Veggies Boost Sleep Quality - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE1SQVlMSEVsU0VCeUEzNkF1cGxIaG1qMmw0M05Qb1JIYm16MlJKaF9ucFpTUkJ2SnJyNl84Y0ppQ2F0QUhTMERSdWV3dXBHMEU2WHRVSzhjV3hBLTAwZVFKZndWT2NobEs1TTNnNnRlSC1ZV0Z1VVFrRg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that eating more fruits and vegetables during the day is linked to improved sleep quality that same night. Researchers discovered that participants who consumed more produce experienced fewer sleep disruptions, including less waking and shallower sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective wrist monitor data showed a clear association between healthy dietary patterns and better nightly rest. These findings suggest that simple dietary changes could be a powerful and natural tool for enhancing sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating more fruits and vegetables in a day improves sleep quality that same night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep fragmentation was reduced in participants who followed CDC dietary recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Consuming the recommended five cups of fruits and vegetables was associated with a 16% improvement in sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From counting sheep to white noise and weighted blankets, people have tried innumerable ways to get a good night’s sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disruptions can have far-reaching negative consequences, impacting cardiovascular and metabolic health, memory, learning, productivity, mood regulation, interpersonal relationships and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110892"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc.jpg" alt="This shows a person sleeping and a bowl of fruit." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sleep-fruit-neurosciecnc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Participants who ate more fruits and vegetables during the day tended to have deeper, more uninterrupted sleep that same night, as did those who consumed more healthy carbohydrates like whole grains. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that an important tool for improving sleep quality may have been hiding in plain sight…in the produce aisle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine and Columbia University found that eating more fruits and vegetables during the day was associated with sleeping more soundly later that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dietary modifications could be a new, natural and cost-effective approach to achieve better sleep,” said co-senior author Esra Tasali, MD, director of the UChicago Sleep Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The temporal associations and objectively-measured outcomes in this study represent crucial steps toward filling a gap in important public health knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncovering the connection between diet and sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that inadequate sleep can cause people to gravitate towards unhealthier diets higher in fat and sugar. However, despite the far-reaching effects of sleep on public health and even economic productivity, doctors and scientists know far less about how diet can affect sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous observational studies, high fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with better self-reported overall sleep quality, but this new study was the first to draw a temporal connection between a given day’s dietary choices and objectively-measured sleep quality that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy young adults who participated in the study reported their food consumption each day with an app and wore a wrist monitor that allowed the researchers to objectively measure their sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers specifically looked at “sleep fragmentation,” an index that reflects how often someone awakens or shifts from deep to light sleep throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising findings support dietary guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that each day’s diet was correlated with meaningful differences in the subsequent night’s sleep. Participants who ate more fruits and vegetables during the day tended to have deeper, more uninterrupted sleep that same night, as did those who consumed more healthy carbohydrates like whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings and statistical modeling, the researchers estimate that people who eat the CDC-recommended five cups of fruits and veggies per day could experience a 16 percent improvement in sleep quality compared to people who consume no fruits or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“16 percent is a highly significant difference,” Tasali said. “It’s remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will help establish causation, broaden the findings across diverse populations, and examine the underlying mechanisms of digestion, neurology, and metabolism that could explain the positive impact of fruits and vegetables on sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But based on current data, the experts confidently advise that regularly eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables is best for long-term sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better,” said co-senior author Marie-Pierre St-Onge, PhD, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia. “Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering — better rest is within your control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher daytime intake of fruits and vegetables predicts less disrupted nighttime sleep in younger adults” was published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health: The Journal of the National Sleep Foundation&lt;/em&gt; in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Hedda L.

Diet was assessed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool. Sleep was measured using wrist actigraphy. Sleep fragmentation index was used for objective assessment of sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-four participants (age: 28.3±6.6years, BMI: 24.1±3.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 82.3% males, 50.0% racial/ethnic minority) provided 201 paired diet-sleep data. Greater daytime intakes of fruits and vegetables (β-coefficient (SE)=−0.60 (0.29), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.038) and carbohydrates (−0.02 (0.007), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.022), but not added sugar (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.54), were associated with lower sleep fragmentation index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends toward associations of higher intakes of red and processed meat (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.10) with more disrupted sleep, as well as higher fiber (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.08) and magnesium (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.09) intakes with less disrupted sleep, were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher daytime intakes of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates that align with a healthy diet were associated with less disrupted nighttime sleep. A 5-cup increase (from no intake) in fruits and vegetables, meeting dietary recommendations, was associated with 16% better sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that diets rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables may promote better sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:43:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1SQVlMSEVsU0VCeUEzNkF1cGxIaG1qMmw0M05Qb1JIYm16MlJKaF9ucFpTUkJ2SnJyNl84Y0ppQ2F0QUhTMERSdWV3dXBHMEU2WHRVSzhjV3hBLTAwZVFKZndWT2NobEs1TTNnNnRlSC1ZV0Z1VVFrRg</guid></item><item><title>一位医生分享了他每天服用的7种补充剂，以减少炎症、预防心脏病和支持新陈代谢- AOL.com | A doctor shares the 7 supplements he takes a day to reduce inflammation, prevent heart disease, and support metabolism - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFB1dGVuUFE5ZXNxZGZvY0tvMXNYV3NVRk5wODZZSWpna3llaWZWWlZzSFYtZXNLNGpvX3gySWFFYldrSWlFSXo2d2d4ejJfbnZsUmdzb0dUYmM2QWh3NnVtNzRvT1NtQWU5MGQ2Y2M1Um5CMGJaUlg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff worked as a liver surgeon for Cleveland Clinic, where he became passionate about supplements to prevent diseases he operated on.&lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Gareth Morris-Stiff/Getty Images/Songboon Ramsak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements like herbs, vitamins, and minerals can backfire if you don't use them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing too many supplements and medications can cause stress and damage to your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A liver doctor explains his 7-step supplement routine, with benefits for healthy aging and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements can be a great way to get an edge in your fitness, reduce the risk of disease, and even boost longevity — but picking the right combination is key to avoiding side effects, said a liver doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common misconception that supplements, especially natural ones like herbs, are safer than medications.

Up to 20% of liver toxicity cases in the US are related to supplements, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a mistake to rule out the potential health benefits of supplements, including those from traditions like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, according to Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff, a former surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://theliverclinic.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Liver Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;The Liver Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of them extremely useful, very beneficial to human health," Morris-Stiff told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the risks from supplements come from taking too much, or too many compounds at once, including medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of getting the right compound for you as an individual for your needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to combine supplements without damaging your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important rule for your supplement routine is to choose the right supplements for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can work out the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to reduce inflammation, milk thistle can help. But it doesn't mix well with other herbs or drugs like antivirals or sleep medications. Combined, it can become too much for the liver to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said one patient he worked with had a cirrhotic liver and jaundice, with yellow skin and eyes, after taking medications with supplements and home-grown garden herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individually they were good, but everything coming together, it ended with toxicity. There's too much competition for the detoxification system in the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check an online research database, such as from the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, for safety information and any known drug interactions before starting a supplement. And always consult your doctor if you're not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Morris-Stiff takes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Curcumin or turmeric for inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said daily curcumin has been part of his routine for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/turmeric-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turmeric;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, and research has found it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. A &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009219/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found curcumin may help slow aging and help protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His daily dose of turmeric comes from a supplement blend called De-Liver-Ance developed by The Liver Clinic, which also includes peppermint, star anise, red sage, and the nutrient choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vitamin D is crucial for the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he takes a daily multivitamin which contains 5,000 units of vitamin D, well over the typical 600-800 units typically recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that vitamin D has a history of being used in large doses to help the body fight off &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-d3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:illness and infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;illness and infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's more in line with what we need," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of Americans are deficient in the nutrient. Talk to your doctor to get your own levels tested and see whether supplementing might help, and how much to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Selenium reduces risk of chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mineral found in nuts, seafood, beans, and organ meats, selenium is a antioxidant that can help reduce the risk of heart disease and somes cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff takes 200 micrograms per day, about four times as much usually recommended by the FDA which he said "woefully inadequate" as the amount of the nutrient in our food has &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611576114" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declined over time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;declined over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Zinc supports healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same multivitamin Morris-Stiff takes daily also includes 50 milligrams of zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/zinc-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Zinc&lt;/a&gt; is another trace mineral with an important role in protecting metabolism and healthy cell development over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Magnesium is key for brain and muscle health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out his daily mineral supplements, Morris-Stiff said he takes &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:500 milligrams of magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;500 milligrams of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, twice per day, to improve sleep and to help manage a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I use it for rest and sleep predominantly, it helps calm my heart," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-for-sleep?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; has surged in popularity in recent years as a tool for more restful sleep, as it helps regular the nerves, muscles, and brain, potentially easing anxiety and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Fatty acids fight inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff routinely supplements essential fatty acids like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/omega-3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, which have been linked to healthy aging, lower information, and reduced accumulation of fat in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently switched to taking a similar &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fatty-acid-butter-dairy-may-be-healthy-new-research-suggests-2022-3?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatty acid called C15:0;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fatty acid called C15:0&lt;/a&gt;, which emerging evidence suggests may reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a surgeon scientist, I like to look at the evidence," he said. "I'm learning and I'm adapting and changing as I come across better supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Probiotics like kombucha boost gut health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-shares-foods-prescribed-to-fight-disease-2024-5?utm_campaign=insider-sf&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Certain foods help prevent illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Certain foods help prevent illness&lt;/a&gt;, too, particularly fermented foods that offer a dose of probiotics, bacteria that support a healthy gut and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he drinks both &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/what-is-kefir?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt;

and the eighth-most populous  in the US, with a population of over 2.6 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infected woman also traveled to the city of Plano, and she visited two businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On May 31 between the hours of 9am to noon the infected woman visited Lemma Coffee in the downtown area and the next day, on June 1, she went to the First Baptist church from 1pm to 5:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials said the woman has received care, and they are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to DCHHS, this is an ongoing investigation of an isolated case because the source of the woman's exposure to measles is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the new case comes as Texas is battling a measles outbreak that has infected nearly 800 people and killed two children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of America's biggest counties is on red alert after a resident was diagnosed with measles, potentially infecting others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dallas &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;officials are warning anyone&lt;/a&gt; who fears they may have been exposed to contact their health provider and monitor for symptoms in what is the latest in a string of measles scares to rock America's major cities and travel hubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the first case in Dallas County amid a major outbreak across Texas. At this time, 744 cases have been confirmed in the state since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-six of the patients have been hospitalized and there &lt;span&gt;have been two fatalities in unvaccinated school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, in the US there have been 1,168 confirmed measles cases reported by 34 states and at least three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the world's most contagious disease - infecting nine out of 10 people exposed - but those who are fully vaccinated are protected in 97 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and a high fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If severe, it can lead to life-threatening pneumonia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children need two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine: the first at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to three in 1,000 people with measles dies of the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html" class=""&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html" class=""&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is below the 95 percent needed to prevent the disease from spreading and causing deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Whether you’re into sports or simply hoping to stay active for the long haul, learning about a supplement called creatine can feel like a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking plenty of water and making smart dietary choices might help, but many people still worry they’re missing something crucial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-creatine-the-basics"&gt;Understanding creatine – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a natural substance your body uses for energy. It helps your muscles, brain, and other parts of your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-is-far-more-important-than-weight-for-living-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body work better&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body makes some creatine on its own, and you also get some from eating meat and fish. But not everyone gets enough – especially people who don’t eat much meat or fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t get enough creatine, it can affect your health. Kids and teens who don’t get enough may be shorter, weigh less, or have more body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults may have a higher chance of getting sick or having problems with memory and thinking. Some women might have more issues with pregnancy or their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-can-reshape-a-babys-brain-before-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reproductive health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older people with low creatine might have more trouble with heart health, thinking clearly, or staying strong. This new study digs much deeper into the health benefits of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-creatine-is-good-for-health"&gt;Why creatine is good for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Kreider from &lt;a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; is studying creatine as a natural compound, where it is found in meat and fish, that plays a key role in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-tracking-apple-watch-is-helpful-but-not-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It converts into &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Phosphocreatine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphocreatine&lt;/a&gt;, which powers your cells when you’re pushing yourself in demanding workouts or dealing with daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not only about lifting heavier or running faster. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8228369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that being low in creatine can correlate with less lean mass, heightened body fat, and reduced athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have studied creatine for several decades, looking into its safety and effects on adults, children, and even older populations. One large &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported that plenty of individuals fail to get enough from diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-creatine-do-you-really-need"&gt;How much creatine do you really need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it’s expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,” said Dr. Kreider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-bursts-of-intense-exercise-can-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bodies&lt;/a&gt; typically produce about one gram of creatine per day, which falls short of what most of us need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5545206/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; suggest starting with five grams of creatine four times daily for about a week, and then reducing to 5 to 10 grams a day. This approach boosts creatine without relying solely on large quantities of meat or fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your exact dose can depend on muscle mass, level of activity, and dietary habits. Whether someone is an athlete in heavy training or a retiree looking to stay active, practical guidance from a medical professional is often the best route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-creatine-safe-nbsp"&gt;Is creatine safe? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,” said Dr. Kreider. Though you might have heard stories about bloating or cramps, these claims are unsubstantiated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent comprehensive study, involved more than 600 trials, and saw no major uptick in side effects among creatine users compared to those taking placebos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims that creatine harms the kidneys or leads to long-term problems have not been supported by real-world research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as with anything else you put in your body, quality matters. Choosing products from reputable sources and verifying labels can help you steer clear of questionable ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-health-benefits-for-different-ages"&gt;Clear health benefits for different ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people grow older, maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-ai-artificial-intelligence-changing-health-diet-fitness-exercise-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; mass and healthy cognition can get tricky. Researchers have observed that creatine, when taken consistently, may support muscle health and daily function in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents might also stand to gain. When diets fall short in providing the recommended two to four grams of creatine a day, kids could experience slower growth and higher body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working out isn’t the only time you rely on strong muscles. Everyday tasks like standing up from a chair, carrying groceries, and climbing stairs depend on maintaining muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those on plant-based diets, supplementing can make sense. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, you skip the top food sources of creatine (meat and fish), so a supplemental form can fill that gap more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-health-and-creatine-supplements"&gt;Human health and creatine supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/books/reprint/5131-creatine-supplementation-for-health-and-clinical-diseases"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; have probed links between creatine levels and mood, immunity, and even heart health. While the evidence is still growing, they see promise in using it alongside a balanced lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost factor also comes into play. Buying high-quality red meat or fish every day can strain your wallet, while creatine supplements can be a cost-friendly way to meet your target intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though you can measure out a few grams of powder daily, it’s smart to pair creatine with a nutrient-rich diet. Complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats all work in tandem with creatine to energize your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is also crucial. Water helps your system manage nutrients, including creatine, and keeps you from running on empty. If you have any underlying health concerns, it’s wise to check in with a trusted professional to fine-tune your plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:22:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOWWFTdk5tTi0wQm41U2xoNHJDTG5TTGFuQWQtNERraUhhd2ROcDU3eXRfYjNFSktYTnNIcWxXM082M0Y0U0N6YUdmVTYzbHc3VUEtbmNKZk82SFhpUUs0UjVoZjBJakdYZGEwakZOWmJzOVRtYjJZRlNJelpqRTZsZWM0dlBmM0hxa2RwaU1ZMjJYTi1yc29melk5LWg</guid></item><item><title>意见：延长寿命的秘诀可能是这种老式的英式早餐- MarketWatch | Opinion: The secret to a longer life could be this old-fashioned English breakfast - MarketWatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQekxReE9PdlQyZGZ4SFFOcHI1R3ZwTnlXNUxDNGdkT1Qwdmc0SVBFSjBEUkVZMVA4SzJYeHJnandDLTBmWmlVcUNWeUhmcV9RZjB5VzVGT0VESnlJcmItVGx6WHlyMm1WcUdwT1Azei1Ba2RTN3B2WXpkaVdIbENoUlhld3FaUGRDV3Zlc2ktMl9VUmRVWUxpYmlxTk53NUEwcHdVZDF3VTFUUUp1NDlNR2V3UWRqRTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQekxReE9PdlQyZGZ4SFFOcHI1R3ZwTnlXNUxDNGdkT1Qwdmc0SVBFSjBEUkVZMVA4SzJYeHJnandDLTBmWmlVcUNWeUhmcV9RZjB5VzVGT0VESnlJcmItVGx6WHlyMm1WcUdwT1Azei1Ba2RTN3B2WXpkaVdIbENoUlhld3FaUGRDV3Zlc2ktMl9VUmRVWUxpYmlxTk53NUEwcHdVZDF3VTFUUUp1NDlNR2V3UWRqRTA</guid></item><item><title>在加州大学伯克利分校发现了猎鹰。钟楼小鸡是否还有希望？ - Berkeleyside | Falcons have been spotted at UC Berkeley.

Credit: Cal Falcons/Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a female peregrine falcon paid a visit to the top of the Campanile on the UC Berkeley campus last week, the sighting raised hopes that another nest of fluffy chicks might follow, if not this year then in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beautiful girl, I hope she sticks around,” wrote a commenter under a webcam photo of the bird posted on Instagram by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKigk5WoqaA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="&gt;Cal Falcons&lt;/a&gt;, a group of scientists and volunteers who document the Campanile falcons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We had an unknown female visiting the tower this afternoon. Hopefully we’ll start to see more exploration of the Campanile soon!,” posted Cal Falcons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Annie, the female peregrine who enchanted Berkeley by producing chicks at the Campanile for eight consecutive years starting in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/02/24/uc-berkeley-falcons-missing-avian-flu-annie-archie"&gt;failed to return&lt;/a&gt; to the campus to breed this year, any falcon sightings have been greeted with enthusiasm. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Since the beginning of this year, we’ve probably seen about five birds (landing at the Campanile),” said ecologist Sean Peterson of Cal Falcons. “None of them have stayed very long; they’ve all been there for five minutes to half an hour.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterson believes the raptors were probably all passing through and moving further north. He said birds will often explore existing or abandoned territories to see if they’re a good fit for future breeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Malec, another Cal Falcons expert, was also excited about last week’s raptor visitor. “All of us were really delighted to see it,” she said. “It looked very healthy.” Malec said the adult bird’s unique markings made clear it was neither Annie nor Archie, Annie’s most recent mate with whom she had&lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/04/25/falcons-hatch-day-shown-live-on-bampfa-wednesday"&gt; four chicks&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-annie-and-archie-have-not-been-seen-for-months"&gt;Annie and Archie have not been seen for months&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds of Annie and Archie making a return to the campus are low. Wildlife photographer Bridget Ahern, who has chronicled the campus falcons for years, told UC Berkeley News in February she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/02/24/uc-berkeley-falcons-annie-and-archie-are-missing-is-avian-flu-the-cause/"&gt;last saw Archie in December, when the pair were mating, and Annie on Jan. 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebrated peregrines haven’t been spotted since then, forcing the falcon experts to conclude they’re not alive. “Peregrines are very loyal to their nest sites. They don’t just go somewhere else. The fact that they are not here, we can pretty much conclude that they are dead,” Malec said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists are attributing their absence to the virulent H5 Bird Flu, or avian flu that is killing birds nationwide. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;Data &lt;/a&gt;from the Center for Disease Control (C.D.C.) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;shows California&lt;/a&gt; has among the highest number of flu cases in the country.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Peterson said 50% of the Bay Area’s historic territories for falcons have been unoccupied for the last two years. Floaters, the replacement falcons who swoop in to take over a territory or mate, and might provide hope for a new family at the Campanile, are also dropping in number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Jose City Hall is one of the lucky sites to have an active nest this year. “Their babies just fledged, (and) they flew for the first time,” Peterson said. A recent San Jose City Hall Falcons Facebook post showed four peregrine chicks &lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02c45yAdFCQPGdWvrJYp6iucM7iBWJvMfM5Yennp7fKr6y3sJjdJkTeCNJ51r6sDb5l&amp;amp;id=100064867295116&amp;amp;mibextid=wwXIfr"&gt;hanging around the louvers&lt;/a&gt; of the City Hall building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avian-flu-pretty-bad-among-falcons"&gt;Avian flu “pretty bad” among falcons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avian flu is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;widespread among wild birds&lt;/a&gt;, according to the C.D.C. Malec said the infection rate is “pretty bad now” among falcons, and that raptor researchers need a year to gauge the extent of the long-term damage to the species. “This coming winter will tell raptor biologists whether peregrine falcons are going to survive it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Audubon Magazine said the current decline in peregrine falcon numbers had &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/why-are-peregrine-falcon-numbers-falling-united-states-again"&gt;“not seen since the DDT era”&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s and ‘70s, when the raptors were near extinction due to widespread use of the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie, who was estimated to be 10 last year, was an exceptional breeder. She produced a batch of eggs every year between 2016 and 2024, and birthed a total of 22 chicks. Just three of the 22 offspring have been sighted in the Bay Area since they fledged, said Peterson. They were on Alcatraz island, in San Jose, and in Vallejo; but they’ve not been seen recently and Peterson has attributed their absence to avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peregrines are the fastest birds in the world. When they dive down to capture prey below them, they can reach speeds of up to 240 miles an hour. Some peregrines migrate, but a long trip is not why Annie and Archie have disappeared. “Birds that are breeding up in Canada leave their nest in August and fly down to Mexico and stay until April or May before returning,” Peterson said. “Bay Area falcons are different; they stay here, year round.” He said it was “pretty weird” in 2022 when Annie vanished for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;

Left to right — Rosa, Luna and Zephyr. Credit: Cal Falcons &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Campanile’s height — 307 feet, which makes it the tallest structure in Berkeley — makes it attractive to falcons which like to be really high, according to Malec. The many smaller birds who are drawn to the area’s numerous trees, and on which the peregrines prey, also gives the campus a competitive edge. “There are pigeons and sunbirds around, and shorebirds as we’re are not far from the Bay,” Malec said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the bell tower is ready and waiting to host another peregrine family. The three webcams that have monitored the bell tower’s falcons since 2019 continue to roll, and the gravel nest where eggs are hatched is being maintained. The area is kept private too. “The university is very good about keeping the doors (to the site) locked, putting up signs warning people (visitors) not to go up,” Malec said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malec believes the continuing impact of avian flu means it might take a couple of years before the Campanile welcomes another mating raptor couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterson holds on to a glimmer of hope that we’ll see visitors who decide to stay before then. “There could be one next week,” he said, “Who knows? We could have a bird any time.” Realistically, however, he thinks it’s likely we’ll see a falcon establishing a territory at the Campanile over the fall-to-winter timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Supplements can be a great way to get an edge in your fitness, reduce the risk of disease, and even boost longevity — but picking the right combination is key to avoiding side effects, said a liver doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common misconception that supplements, especially natural ones like herbs, are safer than medications. They can actually cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-doctors-dangers-of-taking-multiple-supplements-less-is-more-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt; if taken incorrectly. Up to 20% of liver toxicity cases in the US are related to supplements, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a mistake to rule out the potential health benefits of supplements, including those from traditions like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, according to Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff, a former surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and chief medical officer at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://theliverclinic.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;The Liver Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of them extremely useful, very beneficial to human health," Morris-Stiff told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the risks from supplements come from taking too much, or too many compounds at once, including medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of getting the right compound for you as an individual for your needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1cf7fede-ca92-4715-8c6c-ed4a6ab85a1c" data-toc-id="1cf7fede-ca92-4715-8c6c-ed4a6ab85a1c"&gt;How to combine supplements without damaging your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important rule for your supplement routine is to choose the right supplements for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can work out the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to reduce inflammation, milk thistle can help. But it doesn't mix well with other herbs or drugs like antivirals or sleep medications. Combined, it can become too much for the liver to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said one patient he worked with had a cirrhotic liver and jaundice, with yellow skin and eyes, after taking medications with supplements and home-grown garden herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individually they were good, but everything coming together, it ended with toxicity. There's too much competition for the detoxification system in the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check an online research database, such as from the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, for safety information and any known drug interactions before starting a supplement.

But not everyone is quite in agreement with that as doctors say the claims could be ‘dangerous’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's often used in labs (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is methylene blue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Originally developed in the 1800s as a textile dye, the substance was found to have niche medical uses and was first used to treat malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It’s also had uses for cyanide poisoning, the rare blood disorder called methemoglobinemia and can be used by surgeons to highlight abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But then it’s also used to treat parasites in fish as well as aquatic ailments like swim bladder disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It’s still used industrially in some cases, as a synthetic dye for textiles and the likes of printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Yet there are wellness influencers who suggest it’s one of the ‘best kept secrets in biohacking’ and can be a ‘game changer for mental clarity and longevity’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the claimed benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some studies show methylene blue can alleviate mental health issues, with a 2011 trial finding improvements in bipolar disorder symptoms, a 1987 US study indicating it could help with severe depression and a 2020 Chinese study suggesting it may help with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It’s speculated that the stuff could slow down ageing and improve brain function but many of these studies used small sample sizes.

They found that physical activity alters gene activity in microglia and a newly identified type of astrocyte linked to blood vessels, which may protect memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic gene &lt;em&gt;Atpif1&lt;/em&gt; emerged as a key player in promoting the birth of new neurons. These findings were confirmed in human brain tissue, offering new paths for cell-targeted Alzheimer’s therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell-Specific Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise changed gene activity in microglia and newly discovered neurovascular astrocytes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuron Formation:&lt;/strong&gt; The gene &lt;em&gt;Atpif1&lt;/em&gt; was identified as a potential driver of neurogenesis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings from the mouse model matched patterns seen in human Alzheimer’s brain tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using advanced single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and a widely used preclinical model for Alzheimer’s disease, researchers from Mass General Brigham and collaborators at SUNY Upstate Medical University have identified specific brain cell types that responded most to exercise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, which were validated in samples from people, shed light on the connection between exercise and brain health and point to future drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110888"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows a person on a treadmill and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/exercise-genetics-Alzheimers-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To ensure the findings were relevant to humans, the team validated their discoveries in a large dataset of human Alzheimer’s brain tissue, finding striking similarities.

			&lt;p&gt;Bad news for extreme exercise junkies out there: too much vigorous exercise could temporarily make your immune system less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least, that's what the evidence shows. An analysis from 2023 of over 4,700&lt;/span&gt; post-exercise fluid molecules from firefighters suggests workers who require intense fitness training, such as emergency workers and athletes, may put themselves at risk of some illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who are very fit might be more prone to viral respiratory infection immediately after vigorous exercise," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1007461"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) biomedical scientist Ernesto Nakayasu. "Having less inflammatory activity to fight off an infection could be one cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the following video for a summary of the study's findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32139352/"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that moderate physical activity among healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/8/1801/454550/Impact-of-exercise-on-the-immune-system-and"&gt;can favor the immune system&lt;/a&gt; in the long run, what happens to the immune system directly following vigorous exercise is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little reliable evidence that supports the claim that intense exercise heightens the risk of opportunistic infections, although a few &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16558471"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2266764/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e318243253d"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; self-reported upper tract respiratory infections in athletes, compared to control groups, after strenuous activities. Whether these are correlations or causations is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Nakayasu and colleagues tested the blood plasma, urine, and saliva, from 11 firefighters before and after 45 minutes of intense exercise hauling up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear over hilly terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143822" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642.jpg" alt="People carrying gear up a hill" class="size-full wp-image-143822" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143822" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People who are very fit might be more prone to viral respiratory infection immediately after vigorous exercise.

"Perhaps we can reduce the risk of strenuous exercise for first responders, athletes, and members of the military."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no question exercise does wonders for our health, from boosting moods to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-might-delay-the-spread-of-cancer-by-fuelling-the-immune-system"&gt;strengthening our immune systems&lt;/a&gt;. But as in previous studies, the new research detected possible signs of immune suppression within the worked-out firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the expected physical changes helping our bodies maintain the increase in fluids, energy, and oxygen that exercise demands, there was a decrease in molecules involved in inflammation. This was accompanied by increased &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiorphin"&gt;opiorphin&lt;/a&gt;, a dilator of peripheral blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these changes ultimately mean for the short-term function of the immune system is unclear, but the researchers have a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Opiorphin] may increase blood flow to muscles during the exercise regimen to improve the delivery of oxygen and nutrients," the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;writes in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We postulate that the decrease in inflammatory molecules we observed in the saliva after exercise might represent an adaptive mechanism to improve gas exchange in response to higher cellular oxygen demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143821" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642.jpg" alt="A man using battle ropes" class="size-full wp-image-143821" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143821" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There's no question exercise does wonders for our health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADt-FxXAaE/"&gt;Ugur Karakoc/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was change in the participants' oral microbiome too. The scientists suspect this was due to the increase in antimicrobial peptides found in the firefighter's mouths after their intense activity, possibly to compensate for the immune suppression, although this conclusion is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, this increase in antimicrobial peptides had no effect on inhibiting &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; growth," Nakayasu and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;elaborate&lt;/a&gt;, "suggesting a limited capacity of antimicrobial peptides within the oral cavity to protect against host infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, other scientists argue some of the changes observed may not be indications of immune suppression but of a "&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;heightened state of immune surveillance and immune regulation&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a within-subject comparison reduced the impact of their small sample size, firefighters experience unique exposures to pollutants during fires which may also change their immune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, this study only considered healthy and active men, the researchers cautioned, so further research amongst a broader community is needed to confirm their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, taken with previous studies, "there is evidence supporting a relationship between physical demands and a higher incidence of respiratory infections," Nakayasu and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Military Medical Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2023&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					Presidential Message on National Men’s Health Week, 2025				&lt;/h1&gt;
			
			
				

			
					&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For far too long, the health, happiness, and well-being of our Nation’s men have been neglected, contributing to a troubling reality: men in the United States have a life expectancy five years shorter than women. They visit healthcare providers less frequently and often delay critical care. Men tend to have their first heart attack an average of 10 years earlier than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This neglect has been compounded by a vicious campaign against masculinity. This war on manhood has left many American men in a state of loneliness, confusion, and emptiness, with devastating consequences: men in the United States are four times more likely to commit suicide and more than twice as likely to overdose than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This National Men’s Health Week, I make a solemn pledge to honor the men in America: we will always have your back—and we will never waver in our promise to embolden you to lead long, healthy, and safe lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last month, I proudly signed an Executive Order to deliver most-favored-nation pricing to American patients, improve access to quality medical care, and lower the price of medications.  Together, with my Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are empowering men to prioritize their health and prolong their lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under my leadership, we will relentlessly pursue a healthier future for the men of our nation. We will always lift you up rather than tear you down, and we will champion the voices, values, and wellness of hardworking American men across our country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By continuously monitoring nasal airflow over 24 hours using a lightweight wearable, scientists discovered that these patterns also reflect physical and mental health traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing styles correlated with factors like BMI, anxiety levels, sleep cycles, and even behavioral tendencies. The findings open the door to using breath monitoring not just for identification, but also as a tool to assess and potentially improve emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Identifier:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals can be identified with 96.8% accuracy based solely on their nasal breathing patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathing styles reflect traits like BMI, sleep patterns, anxiety, and depression levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Modifying breathing patterns might improve mental health, suggesting future treatment applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cell Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your breath is one of a kind. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These nasal respiratory “fingerprints” also offer insights into physical and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research stemmed from the lab’s interest in olfaction, or the sense of smell. In mammals, the brain processes odor information during inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn’t each person’s breathing pattern reflect that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the idea, the team developed a lightweight wearable device that tracks nasal airflow continuously for 24 hours using soft tubes placed under the nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren’t enough to capture subtle patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way,” says author Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. We consider this as a brain readout.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sobel’s team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. Using the collected data, the team identified individuals using only their breathing patterns with high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting,” says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person’s body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We intuitively assume that how depressed or anxious you are changes the way you breathe,” says Sobel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it might be the other way around. Perhaps the way you breathe makes you anxious or depressed. If that’s true, we might be able to change the way you breathe to change those conditions.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current device still faces real-world challenges. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device also doesn’t account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soroka and Sobel are already investigating whether people can mimic healthy breathing patterns to improve their mental and emotional states. “We definitely want to go beyond diagnostics to treatment, and we are cautiously optimistic,” says Sobel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this breathing and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#08787a6d7b7b486b6d6464266b6765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Queen Muse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cell.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Queen Muse – Cell Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.05.008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Humans have nasal respiratory fingerprints&lt;/a&gt;” by Noam Sobel et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans have nasal respiratory fingerprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term respiratory patterns are generated by remarkably complex brain networks. Because brains are unique, we hypothesized that their dependent respiratory patterns may be similarly unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, we developed a wearable device that precisely measures and logs nasal airflow in each nostril separately for up to 24-h periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that we could identify members of a 97-participant cohort at a remarkable 96.8% accuracy from nasal airflow patterns alone. In other words, humans have individual nasal airflow fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in test-retest experiments, we found that these individual fingerprints remain stable over extended periods of time, such that individual identification by nasal airflow fingerprints was on par with or better than voice recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we find that the high sensitivity of these fingerprints provides significant indications on both physiological states, such as levels of arousal and body-mass index, and cognitive traits, such as levels of anxiety, levels of depression, and behavioral tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that long-term patterns of nasal airflow reflect the brain drivers of respiration, are individually unique, and have significant implications for health, emotion, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 12:38:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFAyY19pSk1ZeUVkV2NUSFJEampTZWVjeTRiS2pHR2RLaU9PbGROVGt1aGVfQWF6OTZ0SVRxTFZadWc3NlhLU28zajVGejVXVXY3TEd1ajF5ZmkzbC1abGd0T0p5cjQxUXZ3X3lRY3M2bEU2cllheXJJ</guid></item><item><title>当你经常吃西瓜时，你的身体会发生什么-非常健康 | What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Watermelon Regularly - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE52bU8xUmpnT1E1eFRiMmNUWDh5TDh1V01TdWtFWnpBaDE1Z0puTElqV1dIWDF6b2MyUktKWmtlQVhhYUZ3Q05XSWxLeHJIeDBRRm5kVGFEcTdhWjVZYmhLQVcySFlJR1E2WXZyNHowTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason you always crave watermelon when it’s hot outside.

			&lt;p&gt;Getting from A to B on a bicycle more often could reduce risk of dementia, possibly by protecting a part of the brain tied to memory functions, new research finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study carried out by researchers from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China and the University of Sydney backs up the idea that frequent amounts of moderate exercise and keeping the brain busy can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-common-link-between-distinct-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;guard against neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings of this cohort study suggest an association between active travel mode and incident dementia and brain structure," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following UK public health records of nearly half-a-million people aged on average around 56, the researchers looked for a relationship between common forms of transport most and whether individuals developed any &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modes of transport were split into four groups: non-active (cars and public transport), walking, walking and non-active combined, and finally a group of people who primarily cycled to get around, or used cycling alongside other options. Commutes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-commute-may-be-bad-for-you-heres-why"&gt;to and from work&lt;/a&gt; were excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with non-active travelers, the cyclists had a 19 percent lower risk of all-cause dementia, a 22 percent lower risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164593" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, a 40 percent lower risk of young-onset dementia (before the age of 65), and a 17 percent lower risk of late-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164595" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164595" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk.jpg" alt="graph with travel mode on the x axis, listing nonactive, walking, mixed-walking and cycling and mixed walking. on the y axis is incident dementia Hazard ratio. nonactive has a HR of 1.0, walking has a HR of more than 1, mixed walking slightly less than 1, cycling and mixed walking is less than 0.9" class="size-full wp-image-164595" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk-546x415.jpg 546w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk-600x456.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164595" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;All-cause dementia risk for various travel modes. (Hou et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that promoting active travel strategies, particularly cycling, may be associated with lower dementia risk among middle-aged and older adults, which carries substantial public health benefits by encouraging accessible, sustainable practices for cognitive health preservation," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a complex condition, and a whole host of factors are thought to be involved. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2022.112010"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have found a link between spatial navigational abilities and brain volume, for example, which fits in with what the researchers found here: that cyclists ended up with higher hippocampal volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164598" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume.jpg" alt="6 different angles of the brain showing color-coded structures." class="size-full wp-image-164598" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume-636x415.jpg 636w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164598" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The neuroimaging analyses provided evidence for positive associations between cycling and mixed-cycling mode and 10 regional gray matter volumes. (Hou et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be the level of physical activity cycling demands that is largely responsible lowering the dementia risk, or having to negotiate routes and directions, or the need to stay alert, or perhaps being more exposed to fresh air. These are all mentioned by the researchers, as is genetic risk – cycling was less beneficial for those with the APOE4 gene variant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially influential variables like age and education were factored in, but the study doesn't show direct cause and effect – there are plenty of variables that weren't monitored. What it does show is a strong link, which makes sense in the context of other research (associating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;exercise with dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we do know is dementia is a growing issue worldwide, as populations get older. Methods for reducing dementia risk are desperately needed, and cycling could be an easy, affordable option for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dementia has emerged as a leading contributor to dependence and disability among older adults, with the global number of cases projected to rise from 55 million in 2019 to 139 million by 2050," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Brooks Bell and Sarah Beran connected online in July 2023 over something unfortunate they had in common: they were both treated for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; in their 30s after doctors misdiagnosed them. Now, they're working together to prevent others from having the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Beran was told in 2020 at age 34 that she had colon cancer, she chalked her fatigue up to being a working mom with two young kids. And she presumed the blood that had started appearing in her stools was caused by hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was just a crazy time with the kids. They were so young. I was so tired all the time anyway, and I was just so busy," Beran, a stylist in LA, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;common colon cancer symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in people under 50 are abdominal pain, changes to bowel movements such as going more or less frequently, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea, according to a 2024 study published in JAMA Network Open. But other symptoms include blood in feces, unexplained weight loss, anemia, and vomiting for no obvious reason.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many of these symptoms overlap with common digestive problems such as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which means doctors tread a tightrope when it comes to diagnosing younger, generally healthy patients. In a 2017 survey of 1,535 colon cancer survivors under 50 conducted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, 82% said they were initially misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2020 survey by the charity Bowel Cancer UK of 1,073 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed under 50, and 222 people who responded on a patient's behalf, found 42% were told by doctors they were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;too young to develop the condition&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the participants didn't know they could get the disease at their age, and two thirds were initially diagnosed with conditions such as IBS,  hemorrhoids, or anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a challenge to make sure a symptom is attributed to the correct condition without scaring people while also not overlooking the early signs of colorectal cancer, Joshua Demb, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies early-onset colon cancer, previously told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year into having IBS-like symptoms and needing to use the bathroom a lot more than usual, Beran's doctors sent her to a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prevent-colon-cancer-gi-doctor-research-gut-microbiome-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastroenterologist&lt;/a&gt; who said she might have a parasite, but said it was likely nothing to worry about given her age, active lifestyle, and healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An at-home stool test for colon cancer detected no abnormalities. What are known as fecal immunochemical tests, or FIT, are about 80% accurate, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/cancer-center/colorectal-cancer-screening" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}'&gt;University of Colorado Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bleeding got worse, Beran pushed for a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. She said that doctors found a mass on her rectum and "over 100" polyps — small growths that are often harmless but can turn into cancer — on her colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was quite shocking to hear the word 'cancer,'" she said. "Because I was so healthy, it just wasn't something that I thought would happen to me." Growing up, Beran played sports and, before her diagnosis, she exercised almost every day. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-gi-doctor-prevent-colon-cancer-eating-healthy-gut-microbiome-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;She ate plenty of fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two years, Beran was treated with 12 rounds of chemotherapy, and surgery to remove the cancerous tissues. She was given a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bowel-cancer-set-london-marathon-record-stoma-adele-roberts-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;temporary ileostomy&lt;/a&gt; connecting her small intestine to her abdomen to collect feces while her colon healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, doctors told her the cancer had spread to her lungs, which was treated with more surgery, as well as radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been "cancer-free" for almost three years, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel so silly looking back on it, but who's not tired, you know what I mean?" Beran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dce27ddb-b121-45b6-b923-0b5be3124e57" data-toc-id="dce27ddb-b121-45b6-b923-0b5be3124e57"&gt;Bell's doctor said the blood in her poop was likely caused by hemorrhoids&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;While Beran was struggling with her symptoms in LA in 2019, Bell was seeking her own answers 2,500 miles away in North Carolina, after finding blood in her stool at age 38.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former CEO's doctor told her over the phone that she likely had hemorrhoids. When &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/blood-when-i-wipe" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;the bleeding didn't stop&lt;/a&gt; after a few weeks, Bell's doctor examined her in person and couldn't find hemorrhoids, but said they were probably higher up in her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensing something wasn't right, Bell called a GI doctor without a referral, meaning it wasn't covered by her insurance. A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; revealed that she had stage 3 colon cancer, and was followed by three months of chemotherapy and surgery to remove 10 inches of her colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Bell hit the five-year cancer-free mark, where the likelihood that a cancer patient will have a recurrence drops. The cancer hasn't returned, but the worry never went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The treatment sucks, but the anxiety is so intense and is so persistent," she said, "you can't get away from it. It is barely tolerable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell is glad she trusted her instinct, despite being told several times the blood in her stool was nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were clues all along. You just needed to have someone who is willing to actually ask about your stool and really think about it, not shy away," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bfdb25a0-20a7-42b5-bd76-b6c3561f6016" data-toc-id="bfdb25a0-20a7-42b5-bd76-b6c3561f6016"&gt;More younger people are getting colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, thanks to screening and lifestyle changes, fewer people are developing colon cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. It estimates that in 2025, 107,320 new cases of colon cancer will be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bell and Beran are among a growing number of younger people to develop the disease. One in five colon cancer cases in 2019 were in people under 54, up from one in 10 in 1995, according to ACS data published in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause is unclear, but scientists have pointed to changes in the gut microbiome, antibiotic use, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt; as possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ca4ab9c8-1878-414b-80fd-5276bc2de18a" data-toc-id="ca4ab9c8-1878-414b-80fd-5276bc2de18a"&gt;Giving colonoscopies a trendy rebrand&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beran reached out to Bell online after she saw her Lead From Behind campaign, which featured Ryan Reynolds and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rob-mcelhenney-always-sunny-philadelphia-wrexham-wife-learning-disability-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob McElhenney&lt;/a&gt; getting colonoscopies on camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, they met on Zoom and decided to combine their respective skill sets to create &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldclassclothing.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Worldclass&lt;/a&gt;, a clothing line intended to reframe colonoscopies as cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sell tote bags with the irreverent slogan "colonoscopy enthusiast" printed on, and streetwear-style tracksuits stitched with the the word "ass."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, people are advised to get their first colon cancer screening at 45, partly because age is a risk factor for developing polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if someone younger has more than one symptom of colon cancer, they should consider &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;getting a colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. James Cleary, a gastrointestinal oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, previously told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a colonoscopy, patients are either sedated or under general anesthetic while a thin tube with a camera on the end is put in the rectum and colon to check for polyps. They must fast and take a laxative in the days before the procedure. If polyps are found, they can often be removed then and there, meaning the procedure can help prevent colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're actually more like a fast, cleanse, then a nap. It's actually almost like a spa appointment," Bell said of a colonoscopy. "We could be reframing it in positive ways, where it's just a self-care wellness kind of experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "People do not know that it's this empowering, hopeful thing that can actually protect you from this major threat."&lt;/p&gt;

On kids' menus at restaurants, foods like chicken fingers and hot dogs abound, but rarely are there items like spinach, carrots or whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c21a01" class="body-graf"&gt;If you've given up on trying to get your child to eat vegetables on their own, no one would blame you. That's why so many parents opt to blend extra veggies into pasta sauces and other dishes where they may be less noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-240ca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Luckily, there's one highly nutritious superfood that many parents overlook and is enjoyable for many kids' palates, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/harvard-pediatrician-the-overlooked-superfood-more-parents-need-to-feed-kids.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kelly Fradin recently told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention it's versatile — it comes in many varieties and can be served as a side, blended into sauces and dressings, or even eaten as a meat replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-24b9ba" class="body-heading"&gt;Pediatrician Tip of the Day: Add More Beans to Your Kid's Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd34ec" class="body-graf"&gt;"Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar," Fradin explained. "We often discuss 'eating the rainbow,' emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6011bd" class="body-graf"&gt;"However, there’s one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ef3d29" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b14ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;Beans are one of the top sources of plant-based protein. Plus, many beans are &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/complete-protein-foods-rcna199150" target="_blank"&gt;complete proteins&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids, Fradin noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebbc3c" class="body-graf"&gt;They're also high in fiber, which can improve gut health and reduce blood sugar spikes, keeping energy levels stable. Beans pack in some important micronutrients, too, such as folate, magnesium and B vitamins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf565d" class="body-graf"&gt;Last, beans are affordable and have a long shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-70b35c" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3f3f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Fradin said that, in her experience, many kids genuinely enjoy the taste and texture of beans. Here are some of her ideas to introduce your kids to this surprising superfood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-fd396d" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steam edamame and serve them as a snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put beans in a quesadilla with cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix black beans into brownies to add some nutritional value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add beans to chili, stew and soup recipes your kids already know and love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For more adventurous eaters, try lentil soup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-795a39" class="body-graf"&gt;"There’s a bean recipe out there for everyone," Fradin added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-242910" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz7001m3b6htbsf1qft@published"&gt;I’m a straight woman in my early 30s, and I’ve always struggled to orgasm, but I do have them very occasionally through direct clit stimulation. Recently I was at the doctor and for medical reasons, and she flushed my ears with water. I was startled by how deeply good it felt to have touch inside my ears, and I unexpectedly orgasmed. She thought I was in pain, and I went along with that explanation because I was so embarrassed. I never want to orgasm at the doctor again, obviously. Any tips on how to separate this out? I want to keep things clinical if I have to get it done medically again, but I’d love to have a safe and direct route to orgasm at home. I feel so torn realizing that actually I can come easily, but that the route there is … weird and potentially unsafe. Is something wrong with my body? That is not an erogenous zone!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz8001p3b6h1sx99jmv@published"&gt;That definitely is an erogenous zone. In fact, ear eroticism is common enough that there are loads of articles about it. The vagus nerve, which passes through the ear, has been known to be associated with orgasm, particularly vaginal orgasm, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3100379.pdf?origin=ppub"&gt;since at least the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;. Studies largely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899304011461"&gt;focus on women with spinal cord injuries&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s a good data point. You are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz8001q3b6hh9e8cfic@published"&gt;That said, your ears are delicate, and while people do live whole lives with hearing loss, you’ll want to avoid damage to that area. That means no blowing canned air into your ears, and no digging around with Q-tips.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz8001r3b6h8r4no7dj@published"&gt;If it were me, I’d schedule another appointment with the doctor and explain what happened. They’ve probably heard of cases of pleasure during ear flushing, if not seen it themselves in clinical practice. They can give you medical level information about how to safely stimulate your ears, or at least reduce the risk of harm. If that’s too vulnerable for you, you might inquire about how to flush your ears at home safely. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tp002e3b6huerr8lnu@published"&gt;Before the pandemic started, I finally came to terms with my near exclusive attraction to other women after two years of hooking up with men. I’m happy and confident with this transition, but I’ve encountered a new struggle in my sex life: I’m an average-height, 240-pound woman who wants to wrestle and be physically dominated in bed. Due to my size and people-pleasing nature, I usually get stuck in a more dominant position with my partners. I’m happy to please others, but I don’t get much personal satisfaction when I’m not restrained. This feels shitty to say when my date, while otherwise attractive, doesn’t have the physical means to hold me down. How can I communicate this desire with potential partners? Can I only date women bigger or stronger than me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002h3b6hsga7zbyw@published"&gt;The part of your message where you say you don’t get much direct satisfaction when you aren’t restrained feels pretty crucial. It’s OK to have specific sexual desires and to seek out partners who can and want to meet those desires. Your enjoyment and fulfillment are as important as your partners’ are. Meanwhile, it sounds like you do get something out of fulfilling your partners’ sexual desires, even when that requires taking the active or dominant role, and if that’s the case you should continue to do so to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002i3b6h36ykp68l@published"&gt;Taking turns, or switching (as your sign-off suggests) is a great instinct. You can satisfy your partner in the way that feels best for them, and then be satisfied in the way that feels best for you. The roles you play during sex are just that—roles. They can be as temporary as you want them to be, and you can switch them as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="174" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002j3b6h3tzluiwh@published"&gt;Have you considered restraint with objects? Rope, cuffs, and tape are all popular options. The benefit of this kind of bondage is that it enables one person to restrain another regardless of how large or strong they are and for longer than human endurance lasts. If the restraints are thoroughly applied, you can pull and thrash against them in a way that you might be hesitant to with a person out of fear of hurting them. All of these methods require that your top be cautious about how tightly they’re restraining you and that you check in with your body yourself—specifically any restrained part—to make sure your circulation isn’t cut off. Bondage is inherently risky, and you’ll want to do some research before deciding if you’d like to try it. You’ll also want to be cautious with who you’re allowing to restrain you. Do you know them? Do they have experience and knowledge on mitigating the risks? Establish trust, rapport, and effective communication before proceeding with anything that you can’t immediately extricate yourself from.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tr002k3b6hwu3fknrq@published"&gt;You may be able to enjoy wrestling with people who aren’t as strong as you are by exercising your ability to pretend. Even with a person twice your size, you aren’t going to full-on fight them the way you would an attacker. There’s already an element of fantasy at work for this kind of interaction to be safe enough to engage in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tr002l3b6h61kmu9p0@published"&gt;My two ideas might not work for you, and the answer might be that yes, you need to date women who are larger than you in order to fully enjoy partnered sex. If that’s the case, remember that your desires are OK. You can give yourself permission to seek out people who are able and want to meet your desires. Lots of people prefer certain body types or have a tendency toward certain physical characteristics. You get to have preferences too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="261" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2st05000d3b6itg5d1fur@published"&gt;For most of high school, I assumed that my hormones were just on backorder and that I was a really late bloomer. However, I’m in college now, and I’m realizing that I’m probably asexual but heteroromantic. It was a relief when I first found out this was “a thing”—I always felt self-conscious because I never really got the appeal of sex, and I thought there was something wrong with me. However, I’m starting to realize how incredibly hard it’s going to be to date guys. I’m not sex-repulsed, just kind of &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; on the topic. I could foresee myself maybe having sex with someone if I really liked them, but that wouldn’t be for a very long time. All of that goes to say that I’m not sure how to date or even if it’s morally OK for me to date. It doesn’t seem fair to deprive someone of sex just because I’m not into it, and it’s pretty hard to find other people who have no particular interest in sex but still want a relationship. The only solution I can think of is maybe nonmonogamy, but I don’t know how I’d feel about that in a long-term relationship. I would love to get married someday, but I can’t see how that’s possible without sex. Do I just have to suck it up and realize that I can’t always get what I want, that dating this way isn’t fair to others, and throw myself into fulfilling friendships instead of love? Or is there some way for me to move around this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2sszu00093b6ivt03dre1@published"&gt;Yes, you’re overthinking this. I’m guessing that you’ve been through a large process of life planning recently—what you want to study, informed by what direction you want your career to take—and I’m wondering if you’re feeling pressure to figure out the romantic aspect of your life in the grand sense, too. If that’s the case, you might consider giving yourself a break. You don’t have to have it all figured out right now. It seems like you’re currently borrowing a lot of frustration from your potential future self.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2st0b000e3b6iqm0fouae@published"&gt;You’re correct that the majority of people &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allosexual—meaning they regularly experience sexual attraction. So yes, you’ll encounter more people who are frequently aroused than those who rarely or never want sex. The thing is that most of us allosexuals have criteria—based on sexual orientation, faith or political beliefs, and aesthetic preferences—that drastically narrow the field of possible mates. And a person being allosexual doesn’t necessarily mean that sex, or frequent sex, is something they require. It isn’t so much that you can’t always get what you want, as it is that—like most people—you’ll have to spend significant time looking. You’ll also probably experience rejection, disappointment, and hurt along the way. It’s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2sszv000b3b6i2o9c3eko@published"&gt;If you’re up front with potential romantic partners, it’s their choice to be with you or not. That’s not deprivation, that’s honoring their agency in deciding which kinds of relationships they want to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2sszu00083b6izk7lktbp@published"&gt;I encourage you to spend some time thinking about what you do want out of a romantic relationship. What is your idea of marriage, and why do you want that? Is there something about the idea of nonmonogamy in a long-term relationship that feels scary or otherwise unacceptable? And what does romance look like for you? Is it giving each other flowers? Netflix and actually chill? What makes those things different from friendship? These are all things worth contemplating, without needing to have any answers or decisions right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2tk88000r3b6iw2orbtqu@published"&gt;I have never really enjoyed sex in all the years I’ve been doing it and with all the partners I’ve had. I don’t feel horny, I don’t masturbate, and it doesn’t feel good to me. I’ve just always done it because that’s what you’re supposed to do in a relationship. As I get older, I find myself wanting to go along with it less and less. My partner has their “required minimum” times per week that is acceptable. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/01/do-not-enjoy-sex-partner-wants-advice.html"&gt;Any less than that, they are miserable (their words). &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
