The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and affects people and other mammals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-19f6ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually appear within two to six days of infection and include fever and swollen painful lymph nodes, most commonly found in the armpit, groin and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bf57" class="body-graf"&gt;An average of seven human plague cases are reported each year in the U.S., but those cases aren’t always fatal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the CDC from 2000 to 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-528d9d" class="body-graf"&gt;In the Arizona case, rapid diagnostic testing led to a presumptive diagnosis of Yersinia pestis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6db66c" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans are usually infected through a bite of an infected rodent flea or by handling an animal carrying the disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2024 alone, global spending on anti-aging products was roughly $74 billion. But what if the key to slower aging and longer life hides in psilocybin, the compound found in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/religious-leaders-tried-psilocybin-and-it-changed-their-lives/"&gt;psychedelic mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds strange. Yet science now says it might be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; made a surprising discovery. They found that psilocin, a compound your body produces after eating psychedelic mushrooms, could actually slow down aging in cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study appeared in &lt;em&gt;npj Aging&lt;/em&gt;, and the results stunned even the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-psilocybin-the-basics"&gt;Understanding psilocybin – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the body converts psilocybin into psilocin, it binds to serotonin receptors, altering perception, mood, and cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-before-psilocybin-mushrooms-brain-on-psilocybin-mushrooms-any-questions/"&gt;Brain imaging shows&lt;/a&gt; that under psilocybin, rigid brain networks loosen their grip, allowing parts of the brain that don’t usually communicate to connect in unexpected ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rewiring effect can temporarily dissolve the ego and create a sense of unity or interconnectedness, often described as a profound spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-psilocybin-mushrooms-got-their-magic/"&gt;the magic&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just in the moment – it’s in what comes after. Clinical studies show that a single guided psilocybin session can ease symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psilocybin-may-boost-our-ability-to-learn-and-explore/"&gt;with lasting effects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe this happens because psilocybin disrupts entrenched thought loops and gives people a window to view their life and habits from a new angle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with therapy, it can help someone reframe trauma or break out of destructive mental patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-study-psilocybin-and-aging"&gt;How to study psilocybin and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers grew human lung and skin cells and added psilocin. Normally, these cells grow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; and stop dividing. But this time, something else happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a lower dose, cells lived almost 30% longer. A higher dose pushed that to more than 50%. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-are-experimenting-with-new-approach-to-fight-and-stop-human-aging-necrosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells stayed active&lt;/a&gt;. They kept dividing far longer. They showed fewer signs of stress and less damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated cells had more sirtuin1, a protein that helps cells survive stress. They also showed less DNA damage. And there was another surprise – these cells kept their telomeres intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Telomere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Telomeres&lt;/a&gt; protect DNA from damage. As people grow older, telomeres shrink, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;-related diseases. In this study, psilocin stopped that shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mice-lived-longer-with-psilocybin"&gt;Mice lived longer with psilocybin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists tossed around the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.” They suspected psychedelics could help protect telomeres and slow aging. But no one had ever proved it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just a lab trick. The team also tested psilocybin in aging mice, equal in age to 60 to 65-year-old humans. First, the mice got a low dose of psilocybin. Then they received higher doses once a month for ten months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They waited and watched. The outcome was hard to ignore. About 80% of the treated mice survived the entire study. In the untreated group, only half survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated mice also looked healthier. They had better fur, fewer white hairs, and even some new hair &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/"&gt;growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cells-stay-younger"&gt;How cells stay younger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin activates serotonin receptors. These receptors are not just in the brain – they are everywhere in the body. They exist in the heart, lungs, skin, immune cells, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, psilocin boosted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/sirtuin-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sirtuin1&lt;/a&gt; in cells. This protein helps the body manage oxidative stress. Less stress meant cells stayed younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now believe psilocybin touches many aging pathways. It protects DNA, lowers stress, preserves telomeres, and may slow aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-psilocybin-may-improve-aging-even-later"&gt;Psilocybin may improve aging even later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cells in the body express &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-dopamine-and-serotonin-shape-behavior/"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life,” said study co-author Dr. Louise Hecker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her words say it all: this isn’t just about mental health anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival, which is clinically relevant in healthy aging,” Hecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: it’s never too late to change how we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-better-way-to-age"&gt;A better way to age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery comes at a crucial time. A recent report showed that life expectancy in the United States still falls behind other countries. Americans not only live shorter lives but also struggle with quality in later years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging, not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,” says study co-author Dr. Ali John Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zarrabi worries about extending life without improving well-being. He doesn’t want people trapped in bodies that no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren’t just surviving longer. They experienced better aging,” said Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His words strike a deep chord. Aging isn’t only about years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-just-the-beginning-for-psilocybin"&gt;Just the beginning for psilocybin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers know their work is just beginning. They must study psilocybin in humans. They need to find the safest doses and study long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hurdles. Psilocybin is a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-americans-are-microdosing-psilocybin-mdma-cannabis-lsd/"&gt;controlled substance&lt;/a&gt;. Getting approval and funding takes effort. But many researchers remain hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin already holds FDA “breakthrough therapy” status for depression. This could help speed up future research on aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A psychedelic drug helping people live longer might sound strange. But science rarely cares about what sounds strange. It cares about results. And right now, psilocybin’s results are impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x"

programmes – rolled out in response to outbreaks of five major diseases – are believed to have reduced deaths by around 60% over a period of 23 years, according to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A similar number of infections are also thought to have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers believe that vaccinations stopped much bigger outbreaks of illnesses like Ebola, cholera and yellow fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study also points to the significant economic benefits of vaccination programmes, which run into billions of dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers say this is the first comprehensive study to assess the impact of emergency vaccination programmes in response to the outbreak of five infectious diseases – Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They studied 210 different incidents from 2000 to 2023, covering 49 different countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine roll-outs seem to have had an impressive impact, reducing deaths by nearly 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The number of overall cases of theses infections were also reduced by nearly 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The swift deployment of vaccines also appears to have halted wider outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There were economic benefits too – worth an estimated $32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These benefits come mainly from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But researchers believe this could be a significant underestimate of overall savings, as it doesn't take into account the costs of dealing with a wider outbreak, or the economic disruption caused by a more serious health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's believed the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which occurred before the existence of an approved vaccine, is estimated to have cost West African countries alone more than $53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;The power of

responsible for many of the programmes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Sania Nishtar, the organisation's CEO, says the study shows just how important quick and effective vaccine roll-outs can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective counter-measure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It also underscores the importance of fully funding Gavi, so it can continue to protect communities in the next five years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gavi is currently trying to secure a fresh round of funding in the face of global cuts to foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

times for chronic low back pain face significantly higher risks of dementia (29%) and mild cognitive impairment (85%) within 10 years. The risks were especially pronounced in younger adults aged 35–64, where rates of cognitive decline more than doubled or tripled compared to those not on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a dose-response relationship, with more frequent prescriptions correlating with higher risks. While observational and not proof of causation, the study underscores the need to monitor patients on long-term gabapentin for signs of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults prescribed gabapentin ≥6 times were 29% more likely to develop dementia and 85% more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risks were more than doubled in 35–64 year olds compared to unprescribed peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The more prescriptions filled, the higher the risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BMJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)–29% and 85%, respectively—finds a large medical records study published online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition—18-64 year olds—the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111563"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and pill bottle." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/gabapentine-cognitive-decline-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including if particular age groups might be more vulnerable they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on real-time data from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains electronic health records from 68 healthcare organisations across the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They scrutinised the anonymised records of adult patients who had and hadn’t been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64 year olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn’t been prescribed gabapentin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was no heightened risk among 18–34 year olds prescribed the drug, the risks  of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49 year olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between 3 and 11 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren’t able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude: “Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add: “Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and cognitive decline research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#39545c5d50584b5c55584d5056574a795b5453175a5654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmj.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Ahmed – BMJ&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://rapm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/02/rapm-2025-106577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Risk of dementia following gabapentin prescription in chronic low back pain patients&lt;/a&gt;” by Chong H Kim et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of dementia following gabapentin prescription in chronic low back pain patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-1"&gt;Gabapentin is widely used to treat chronic pain, but its association with cognitive decline and dementia remains unclear. This study examined whether gabapentin prescription is associated with dementia in adults with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX national database of de-identified patient records from 2004 to 2024. Adults diagnosed with chronic low back pain were included; those with prior gabapentin use, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, or cancer were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;Propensity score matching controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and pain medications. Patients were stratified by age and gabapentin prescription frequency. Primary outcomes were dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;26,416 adults we analyzed following propensity-score matching. Patients with six or more gabapentin prescriptions had an increased incidence of dementia (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.18–1.40) and mild cognitive impairment (RR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.63–2.10). When stratified by age, non-elderly adults (18–64) prescribed gabapentin had over twice the risk of dementia (RR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.75–2.51) and mild cognitive impairment (RR: 2.50; 95% CI: 2.04–3.05) compared to those not prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;Risk increased further with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions had a higher incidence of dementia (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.25–1.57) and mild cognitive impairment (RR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.42–1.91) than those prescribed gabapentin 3–11 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;Gabapentin prescription in adults with chronic low back pain is associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, particularly in non-elderly adults. Physicians should monitor cognitive outcomes in patients prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:53:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1sR0ttdVhucmdMOUlka0RMU2dnNVRzR0ZrYVJUUmFLN2EtZVMwdEd5MTNxb0U2VjFxX2VCZmRVd1R2aFlEd195MlZVSnN1M1NrTGZ5cUZhZ3RpNHRmSjdMVGZLZnFLazRtWjFuZjA1N1U5TTg</guid></item><item><title>大脑的青春（或缺乏青春）可以预测你的寿命- ScienceAlert | Your Brain's Youthfulness (or Lack of It) Could Predict How Long You Live - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRGl5b08yczVEeHc0ZXpwQ2NUNnZrZkRtUTB6SGhfSVhiN3pmR1hXYUtHbHRsbjNEX0ljc19HWS1FN1V3cmdpNmxhRFdRTFdoRVI3UjIzdzYwbGZwWUd6TUFzNGdWQTVrcDJKbzdSNjZ1VEF1cTZnZEtRSFpSN2lINmotZllZWTBaVE5TRXJDWWRwTzlZeW9xV2xNSjJtREIt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We celebrate our birthdays on the same day each year, but the truth is that different parts of our bodies are aging &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-body-can-be-younger-than-you-are-heres-how-thats-possible"&gt;at different speeds&lt;/a&gt;. New research suggests brain age could be a strong predictor for lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes from a team from Stanford University, who applied a blood analysis technique on records of 44,498 individuals in a UK health research database, aged between 40 and 70 years old. The analysis gave them an estimated biological age for 11 key organs in the body, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These organ ages were then compared against the health records of the participants, for up to 17 years. Generally, the more 'aged' organs a participant had, the higher their risk of dying within the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one organ had to be chosen as the best single representative, it would be the brain: the data showed that people with a younger brain age tended to have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/record-breaking-human-lifespans-predicted-by-the-year-2060-heres-why"&gt;longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain is the gatekeeper of longevity," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/07/brain-mortality.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you've got an old brain, you have an increased likelihood of mortality. If you've got a young brain, you're probably going to live longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood test used here works by measuring protein levels, and matching those proteins to the organs that produce them. Through some complex calculations, this indicates how well &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-just-mapped-our-bodys-organs-in-exquisite-detail"&gt;each organ is functioning&lt;/a&gt; – whether they're working more like a brand new, souped-up sports car, or a dilapidated old vehicle on the verge of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167513" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis.jpg" alt="Organ age chart" class="wp-image-167513 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis-586x415.jpg 586w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/OrganAnalysis-600x425.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers estimated the age of 11 different organs in the body. (Se-Hwee Oh, &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, the older an organ was – essentially, the more wear and tear indicated by its proteins – the more likely the chances of disease in that organ. The greater the number of 'elderly' organs, the greater the likelihood of disease or an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosting-exercise-intensity-reduces-mortality-risk-study-suggests"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the brain stats that really stood out though. People with "extremely aged" brains (in the top 7 percent in terms of old age) were almost twice as likely to die over a 15-year period, compared to those whose biological brain ages were more in line with their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with "extremely youthful" brains had a 40 percent lower risk of dying within the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were other interesting associations too:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167510" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease was around 3.1 times more likely in extremely aged brains compared to normally aged brains. Extremely youthful brains, meanwhile, were 74 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's than those closer to chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that a whole host of factors combine to increase or decrease our chances of dying or developing diseases, and previous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-witness-patients-brains-de-aging-after-changing-their-diet"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-habits-can-keep-your-brain-looking-young-at-70"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; might all have an impact on brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And brain aging is just one variable linked to lifespan – everything from how carefully you cross the road to your eating habits adds up to determine how long &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;you're going to live&lt;/a&gt;, so we can't say brain aging is the direct cause here. What's more, there's likely to be two-way feedback here, with disease also contributing to organ aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to understand which variables can make the most difference, and to get as full a picture as possible of the contributors to disease and mortality, in order to maximize our chances of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-pinpointed-the-best-diets-to-boost-healthy-aging"&gt;aging healthily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/07/brain-mortality.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wyss-Coray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03798-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"It is spread mostly by wild animals, but stray cats and dogs may also become infected and spread the virus. The rabies virus lives in the saliva and brain tissue of infected animals. Rabies can be spread by scratches from infected animals or when infected saliva comes into contact with open wounds, breaks in the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.)"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, you can call the Ledge Light Health District at 860-448-4882 or Waterford/East Lyme Animal Control at 860-442-9451.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:05:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOOUtZZHZVQjUtN2V0NjhPXzlfV1hXb2V6b0hTSUdJQTUtYjh0VEl0azdMTTBiLU5oR0xxc2QwSkJ1WDRBLS1KLXItcXFQdEVOUkdyWGhpaTBNNUxYVjhmSXdHQVM1X04xUmpGOGN3WGRsa3RHazRRUjQ0MTB1WVRCMEdDTFFWQkVTamh5YWlqQ00zUVhGRncxMkdkMNIBtgFBVV95cUxNLTcxbmNlRzBLcjdBNWpNQ3hyZjZ1QkVCYlE3eGxVSUtKRXJfcV9sLWlrMWs4RnlHc0FCZjZYTktZcmxBNWZTdkJiNW4yMUc1QUhsWllRY1JkT2tEaU4tUmY5Z29qR3ZqT0N6SHp3eWZFZWZScDhQdHd2aWtfcVFHNUFUSlF0M09PcGZOMjhxV3Ewb2thSTZtanlOd3dhZTRhSnh2Z2pNZnVzWEk2OEMtSlV6RkRoQQ</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究表明，这种1种碳水化合物实际上可以帮助您的长寿- HuffPost | A New Study Suggests This 1 Type Of Carb Could Actually Help Your Longevity - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZ3pxOU54dWZRZnlXdV9ZQnVZSU1oUmx1U09WYlNsUk9qek5JOXpCMElZcUkyUzZQX3J3T1ZsLXJPeEtITWthaWVJZENUOFNWeVU0d3Q1Vnhya1FhclcxbHpLckRtTlFUZmpYbHZOMVE1X0pqVEF3UHpBNl95ZnpNbkUwQkhhdTBCNUk1NFFnTGvSAZYBQVVfeXFMTmd6MktfWEJOYUw4MFV6MVF2TF9PTkhEb0J4d25QTEZkd0hPZFVsYXJDSlBNRHlkQ0JJSEszY18wd2lBVURnS1lhVEpLYTZ6ZDR2QnhzWThuczA4anVSQmxNUmxoZmJ3SzZVek1tbzRDZldOR3NBbzRhLU12NDJhWkdCNmhTaGp5ZVFIbXJ6amUtS3psaFh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carbohydrates have long been seen as the villain — the macronutrient worth fearing and restricting — while another reigns supreme as the “healthier” option in the given cultural moment.

Of the studied population, 7.8% met the definition of “healthy aging.” These women lived to age 70 and were free from 11 major chronic diseases, had no memory or physical function impairments, and had good mental health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carbohydrates were one of the most influential factors. Consuming more total carbohydrates and more “high-quality” carbs (from foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes) during midlife was positively linked with healthy aging. On the flip side, consuming more “refined” carbs (from added sugars, refined grains like white flour, etc.) was linked with lower odds of healthy aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’ve all heard that different carbohydrates can affect health differently, whether for weight, energy or blood sugar levels,” Andres Ardisson Korat, the lead author of the study, said in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250516133230.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a press release" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250516133230.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But rather than just look at the immediate effects of these macronutrients, we wanted to understand what they might mean for good health 30 years later. Our findings suggest that carbohydrate quality may be an important factor in healthy aging.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It sounds ground-breaking, but according to Chan, the research simply adds to a growing list of studies showing that dietary fiber — a type of carbohydrate — is king.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Maria Korneeva via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maria Korneeva via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Dietary fiber can be found in all fresh fruits and vegetables.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to know about dietary fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we look overall at any sort of nutrition research, or if we’re comparing specific diets or things like that, the thing that typically always rings true is the fiber content of it,” Chan explained. “From an overall metabolic standpoint, from a cardiovascular standpoint, from just an overall health metric standpoint, fiber is going to be the one thing that’s going to be health-promoting in every single area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fiber helps keep your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html#cdc_generic_section_2-types-of-fiber" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="bowel movements regular" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html#cdc_generic_section_2-types-of-fiber" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bowel movements regular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="feeds the beneficial bacteria" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;feeds the beneficial bacteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (read: probiotics) that make up your gut microbiome, among other perks, said registered dietician &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/kreutzer/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cary Kreutzer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab10ee4b0103c0b538a18" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/kreutzer/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cary Kreutzer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;an instructional professor of clinical gerontology and pediatrics at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.

Getting your fill of carbs from fiber-rich whole grains, fruits and vegetables, beans and legumes, and nuts and seeds means you’ll also score essential vitamins and minerals (think: iron, B vitamins) that are health-promoting, she noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the study was produced by researchers affiliated with renowned institutions like Tufts University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, there are some limitations to keep in mind. The study population was only female nurses, who were predominantly white and well-educated, so the findings may not be generalized to a more diverse population. The data also show connections — not clear cause and effect. “I think one of the issues with it is that when we’re looking at big cohorts of data like that, we can’t put people in a vacuum; we can’t put them in a room for 20 years,” Chan said. “So I would say it’s more of an associative effect.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s important to consider how access might play a role in the results, too. “Is it, basically, the economic and financial and time privilege of those individuals that’s also creating some more of these positive health outcomes that we’re seeing, or is it just the whole grains? Obviously, in a longitudinal cohort study, we can’t really specifically study that,” Chan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Considering the well-studied benefits of fiber, however, it’s worth prioritizing in your diet.

To Chan, one of the simplest ways to amp up your intake is to flip your mindset. Ask yourself, “What can I add to my plate that’s beneficial?” rather than, “What can I cut out that’s ‘bad’?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we look at our relationship with food, the more that we focus on what we shouldn’t be doing, the more we end up only thinking about that, and it becomes hyper-restrictive, and then we end up feeling guilty about the decisions that we make,” Chan said. Seek out ways to incorporate another fruit into your breakfast, veggie into your midday snack or whole grain (e.g., barley, farro, brown rice, quinoa) into your dinner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Of course, chronic health conditions are multifactorial, and prioritizing fiber-rich foods is just one element of prevention. If you’re able, regularly meet with your health care provider to check your blood pressure, cholesterol and other metrics, she recommends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Changing your eating habits can feel overwhelming and, to some middle-aged folks, too late to make a difference. But making small tweaks now could have a big impact on your health down the line. “I think many people think, ‘What’s going to happen to me is going to happen to me, and I don’t have control,’” Kreutzer said. “I think people need to know that they can make those changes now, and it potentially can add years to their life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNZ3pxOU54dWZRZnlXdV9ZQnVZSU1oUmx1U09WYlNsUk9qek5JOXpCMElZcUkyUzZQX3J3T1ZsLXJPeEtITWthaWVJZENUOFNWeVU0d3Q1Vnhya1FhclcxbHpLckRtTlFUZmpYbHZOMVE1X0pqVEF3UHpBNl95ZnpNbkUwQkhhdTBCNUk1NFFnTGvSAZYBQVVfeXFMTmd6MktfWEJOYUw4MFV6MVF2TF9PTkhEb0J4d25QTEZkd0hPZFVsYXJDSlBNRHlkQ0JJSEszY18wd2lBVURnS1lhVEpLYTZ6ZDR2QnhzWThuczA4anVSQmxNUmxoZmJ3SzZVek1tbzRDZldOR3NBbzRhLU12NDJhWkdCNmhTaGp5ZVFIbXJ6amUtS3psaFh3</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的营养素可能是治疗痴呆症的秘密武器，您只需24便士即可将其添加到您的饮食中-每日邮报 | This common nutrient could be the secret weapon against dementia-and you can add it to your diet for just 24p - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQbGh1WDkzcU9PMF95TVR5OFVsTHBhV2RuV0l1WHF3b0VidG5YeVRJLTRIUmk1clJUMHdTWnlJRmJsX0I5dzJKNzVNR01MME9KYzdObWsyMVdFZDJuaFAyeGdzTEQwaGZqT204a1FDS2J2X20yQjNpQjZFbjdfblg0eExudzlRTXNpeTVySWJB0gGTAUFVX3lxTE1jVjZLeUVvYTVTc290ejZsb1UzWDRjNGpJemxSaGN6VUt4UUFNUUJfX2dwanVhWTZzelpMM3JiZ2l1RXd2SnVsVGR3QWpQLVJBRG41aXBxYnBBQzgtVDhlaTVfTUp6aVBYeVdYQXdWSV9QZ2RBTXZHd3lfZXYyRHM2MWRRSlc0T2ZzLVUzbDhxVU5MVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We've all heard that 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away'—and now a new study has found that the same can be said of potatoes, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that eating a diet rich in copper can help the body stave off dementia, and the mineral is naturally found in the patchy light brown skins of the pantry stalwart, which you can pick up for just pennies at a local greengrocer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in medical journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-09280-9"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt; found that people who added copper to their daily diet experienced better cognitive function than those who ate relatively low levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-5e10a840-5e2b-11f0-8e03-033403249ca0" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, found that 1.22mg of copper per day—approximately two medium sized potatoes—significantly boosted brain health and helped ward off disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking of the findings, lead author Professor Weiai Jia urged those who have a history of stroke in particular to add copper to their daily diet—and it can be in the form of potatoes, or other foods naturally packed with it, like wholegrains and beans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary copper is crucial for brain health', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because copper—a naturally occurring trace element—triggers the release of iron which helps carry oxygen around the body—and protects the brain against cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, the essential nutrient is also thought to be important for infant growth, brain development, the immune system and bone health, and recommends adults aged 19 to 64 try to consume 1.2mg of it a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The richest dietary copper sources include potatoes, shellfish, nuts and seeds, wholegrains and chocolate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7 million within two decades as people live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists believe that copper-rich foods may help regulate the release of neurotransmitters in the brain that are closely related to learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia affects an estimated one million people in the UK and has a variety of causes, such as Alzheimer's disease and reduced blood flow to the brain following a stroke, known as vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said that the links between dietary copper intake and cognitive function are complex, but highlighted energy metabolism and neurotransmission as potential reasons why copper can help protect brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that a lack of copper may accelerate the cognitive collapse that is associated with dementia—for instance memory loss, language difficulties and problems with thinking and reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers warned that whilst copper is essential for optimal brain functioning, too much copper can be toxic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-9d06e230-5e3f-11f0-a676-a3ed8ca42684" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14896123/nutrient-cheap-diet-dementia.html"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the longitudinal study, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2420 American adults were analysed to see how dietary copper intake affected cognitive function, especially in participants with a history of stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, having a stroke may triple someone's risk for developing dementia within the following year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants' were tracked for for four years and dietary copper intake was determined by averaging two 24 hour dietary recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cognitive function was also assessed by a range of golden metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers concluded that those who consumed the most copper had the highest cognitive scores—after accounting for various confounding factors such as age, sex, alcohol intake and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Our findings indicate a potential association between dietary copper intake and enhanced cognitive function in American older adults, particularly among those with a history of stroke.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers noted that further research is needed to confirm these findings, with a major drawback of the study being that they used self-reported dietary reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as new research warns that millions of people could be up to a third more likely to develop the memory robbing disease because of their tap water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14274407/27-MILLION-Britons-soft-water-dementia.html"&gt; groundbreaking study &lt;/a&gt;suggested earlier this year that people who live in 'softer water' areas of the UK may be at an increased risk of dementia because their water contains lower levels of minerals such as calcium, magnesium and copper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists suggest that these minerals may have a protective effect on the brain with low levels of magnesium linked with a 25 per cent higher risk of Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQbGh1WDkzcU9PMF95TVR5OFVsTHBhV2RuV0l1WHF3b0VidG5YeVRJLTRIUmk1clJUMHdTWnlJRmJsX0I5dzJKNzVNR01MME9KYzdObWsyMVdFZDJuaFAyeGdzTEQwaGZqT204a1FDS2J2X20yQjNpQjZFbjdfblg0eExudzlRTXNpeTVySWJB0gGTAUFVX3lxTE1jVjZLeUVvYTVTc290ejZsb1UzWDRjNGpJemxSaGN6VUt4UUFNUUJfX2dwanVhWTZzelpMM3JiZ2l1RXd2SnVsVGR3QWpQLVJBRG41aXBxYnBBQzgtVDhlaTVfTUp6aVBYeVdYQXdWSV9QZ2RBTXZHd3lfZXYyRHM2MWRRSlc0T2ZzLVUzbDhxVU5MVQ</guid></item><item><title>每周新闻测验- AARP | Weekly News Quiz - AARP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5qczBvM2o2aW0wN3dvZE04a0VRdzNBQkhRLXlicUp2RWYtSlpJazlYTTg5ZzF6bjUtMWJ1ZTE3YjVfMGRvby1RcW82SXZnNTI2YjBZXzVTelR1dUVaVmdUTXB5Y1ZEUGhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-imagecaption" tabindex="0" aria-label="org.apache.sling.scripting.sightly.apps.uxdia.components.content.articlecontentfragment.element__002e__html$1@3ac8ca4"&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1kv918u-0 cDsnpW"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 djDghv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-39650"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”.

However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 09:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPMUpfWG9aODJmbWhMdzFEUjVLNFVGdk9MM3VOejlGSmVjTEFvaWs3eFZCWEdGVDF0dWVJdk5DYjMza0lOUTVzTmN1UExxQjRqbGpLNFItTFdhRmU3ZkdtRXlSWWh4emxqYzNadEtlVFpZVjY1d2pfcXdreE5nZjF6eWE5ZHIwalFEN2ZEMWxFWFF3dXB1SjdfNnRMYUowMWNwaTB2cG1Pdw</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士大喊健康“谎言” ，你应该停止相信，这令人震惊- BuzzFeed | Doctors And Nurses Are Calling Out The Health "Lies" You Should Stop Believing, And It's Shocking - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1STm5xaEloRjFxOGIxdUE3c2pzcnd3TXNDS0NDX1N6MFhLM1k0RjgtMnlUbnlYWDBtbm8wU2w4NVFDSHRMc3hxU1VBMTBZcHo5X215NkQ3VWNZMTlQaXpmMWx5UFFNUmp0LU56UW1FdGl3SjJYSVhadTcycDhvQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Fact: There are many, MANY successful, bright, funny, creative individuals with schizophrenia who have never harmed anyone.

Fact: Hallucinations are just one symptom, and &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003258.htm" target="_blank"&gt;can be caused&lt;/a&gt; by a variety of mental and physical health issues, and stressors.&lt;/b&gt; Some examples include bipolar disorder (more often during manic episodes than depressive), PTSD (during flashbacks), borderline personality disorder, ocular tumors, Parkinson’s disease, drug intoxication, sleep deprivation, stress, sensory deprivation (as seen in solitary confinement, which is illegal to do 24/7 in many places), etc."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 33, California&lt;/p&gt;

A big question, and one I am presently pondering from a prone position, naked but for my underpants, which have been lowered on one side to liberate my left bum cheek. Or glute, as the BMI monitors call it, unromantically. I am posed diagonally across an expertly made bed, inert as if poleaxed. Seen from above, I imagine I resemble a crime-scene corpse in a cheap film noir. Is this a case of death by misadventure? An accidental overdose? Or do we suspect foul play? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, I apologise for the unappetising image. At least you don’t have to gaze upon me in real life, like the nurse preparing to administer my antioxidant injection. It has to be the left bum cheek into which she sinks her hypodermic for the simple reason that she jabbed my right bum cheek yesterday. This is the sequel: &lt;em&gt;Bum Cheek – The Final Reckoning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our scene is playing out in a spotless suite on the fifth floor of a modern building in the picturesque lakeside town of Montreux, Switzerland. Fixtures and fittings are snow-white, like the mountaintops in the distance. There is an air of cleanliness and quiet efficiency that you might accurately describe as clinical. Accurately, since this is a clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I’m not dead. Not yet. In fact, I’m here to find out if I can delay that inevitability for as long as possible without going full blockbuster villain and sinking my teeth into the scenery, so starved am I of my habitual intake of stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7970b4d8-b2ce-4afa-829f-f5d874a25ccd?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A7970b4d8-b2ce-4afa-829f-f5d874a25ccd?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Aec193b3c-3dfe-468d-aa2f-5f4bace18f81?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7970b4d8-b2ce-4afa-829f-f5d874a25ccd.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="Alex Bilmes at The Carpenter’s Arms pub on the Hammersmith/Chiswick border, west London" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex Bilmes at The Carpenter’s Arms pub on the Hammersmith/Chiswick border, west London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; © Peter Flude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have reached day five of the Master Detox programme at &lt;a href="https://www.cliniquelaprairie.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Clinique La Prairie&lt;/a&gt;, among the world’s leading and longest- established facilities in what we might, with only a slight wince, describe as the longevity “space”. It’s Thursday afternoon. Since Saturday not a sniff of alcohol, not a grain of sugar, not a morsel of meat or animal product (no dairy, no fats), not a molecule of artificial sweeteners or preservatives and no gluten has entered my bloodstream. Instead I have ingested a cornucopia of foaming potions and moussed nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first day at CLP I was put on a liquid diet. Not the one I’m used to. Strictly juice. Curcuma Healing; Moringa Booster; Antioxidant Flare. These were supplemented by further boosters. And morning and afternoon drops, which I am still obediently adding to my herbal infusions. Each night before bed I was given two “neutracenical” pills to help me sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have chewed and swallowed “edamame chawan mushi with shiitake, ginger, radish and buckwheat”; “Paimpol coco bean fricassee with fine herbs and tomatoes”; and, my favourite, “iced plant salad crystallinum with salicornia and iodin tofu cloud.” All this washed down with CLP’s signature hydrogen water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my third night I was subjected to a “non-invasive internal cleansing of the intestine”. Meaning I drank a large bottle of laxative. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also had a “chi nei tsang” massage, in which my internal organs were rearranged by a woman kneading my stomach like dough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been stretched and pummelled. Rubbed and smoothed. Chilled and heated. Peeled and exfoliated. I have had consultations with a doctor, a nutritionist, an aesthetician, a dentist, a trainer and a breathing teacher. I have submitted to a “body composition analysis” and two fitness assessments. I have practised aerial yoga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have given blood, urine and stool samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have passed a heavy metal test. (The substance, not a pop trivia quiz, though I fancy I might have aced that too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of reports for &lt;em&gt;HTSI&lt;/em&gt; on my misadventures in longevity and – not gonna lie, as my daughter says – I have cheated already. Yesterday afternoon, I made a break for it and went for a jog along the promenade that hugs tight to the curves of Lake Geneva, like leggings to a yogini. I passed a mini-mart. I stopped and bought a vape. (Vuse, strawberry ice.) I puffed away at it for 20 minutes, on a bench by a local landmark: the statue of Freddie Mercury, the rock star who made Montreux his second home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="inset-left"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;Vital stats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; 52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight:&lt;/strong&gt; 13 stone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Height:&lt;/strong&gt; 6ft (confirmed by professionals)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Units of alcohol drunk per week:&lt;/strong&gt; Too many to mention.

Instead, I felt like a fraud. Is there a more pathetic sight than a greying dad in gaudy running gear, perspiring heavily while sucking surreptitiously on a noxious plastic dummy? In the rain. Would passers-by not be appalled to know that this man had been flown all the way here for his health, only to fall at the first as soon as he leaves the confines of the clinic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, as Freddie Mercury sang, “Who wants to live forever?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much fun is one willing to forgo in a bid to prolong one’s life? How many pleasures, toxic or otherwise, must we sacrifice in the pursuit of a contented senescence? What’s the ROI on giving up your morning flat white, cutting out your evening glass(es) of Sauvignon Blanc, just saying no &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22f21d45-ccbb-45f8-9ad9-fab9a113867a" data-trackable="link"&gt;to steak frites&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are frequently told that life is short. Is it, though? I wonder if, without the above, life might feel very long indeed. In spending so much time trying not to die, we might forget to live. It is said that time is the ultimate luxury. For me, the ultimate luxury might be a cold beer on a hot day. Might I not swap six months of advanced decrepitude for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from the cheap seats the familiar cry goes up: my grandmother was breaking the filters off her Lambert &amp;amp; Butlers well into her 80s, necking G&amp;amp;Ts and cackling &lt;em&gt;like a pirate&lt;/em&gt;! So was mine. But of my other grandparents, two died in their 50s and the other was seen off by a heart attack in his early 70s. Am I prepared to take that chance? Are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;The HTSI longevity quiz: take our test to find out how to maximise your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="auto" data-layout-width="full-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;custom-code-component path="ft-interactive/ccc-htsi-quiz/Component" version="0.0.24" label="Question 10 Results text 1" question_1="How frequently do you struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night?" question_10="On average, how many servings of fruits and vegetables do you eat per day?" question_10_answer_1="Less than one" question_10_answer_2="One to two" question_10_answer_3="Three to four" question_10_answer_4="More than five" question_10_category_text="Nutrition" question_10_results_text_1="Invest in a blender. “Make creamy sauces that you can blend beans into,” says Dr Emily Leeming, a dietitian and scientist at King’s College London. “If you're making mashed potato, keep the skin on and add in some Queen Butter beans.” Or try a frozen berry smoothie. They’re “high in fibre and packed with polyphenols, which are important for brain health.”" question_10_results_text_2="Seek out easy, hydrating vegetables. “A cucumber is 95 per cent water – they're hydrating, have a natural cooling effect and are rich in antioxidants and loads of nutrients,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Often you’ll see a pack of bell peppers that have a green, yellow and a red in one – that’s three types of hydration. Plus they’re super-rich in Vitamin C, which is fantastic for your immune system.” " question_10_results_text_3="“We would all benefit from having five to six portions of fruit and veg a day,” says nutritionist Kat Chan, but “if you’re only thinking about that as boiled broccoli and carrots, it's going to be impossible.” Ask yourself, “can I put something in my scrambled eggs? Can I blend six different things into my soup? Can I drink it? There are lots of different ways in. A portion can be a measuring cup.”" question_10_results_text_4="Go the extra mile and experiment with toppings. “Sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia and flax seeds,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Mix them together in a jar and sprinkle them on anything – omelettes, yoghurt, salads. Fermented foods – pickles, kimchi, sauerkraut – are also great toppings, and are rich in bacteria that supports our gut microbiome. Mix miso into your scrambled eggs or salad dressings.”" question_12="Results" question_12_answer_1="Congratulations! You are doing well to try to live an active, healthy life. But can you make further improvements? “Go the extra mile and experiment with toppings such as sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia and flaxseeds,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “Fermented foods are also great toppings and are rich in bacteria that supports our gut microbiome.” Exercise is good but make sure you don’t overdo it. Overtraining is detrimental for progress: “make sure you’re having rest days,” says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. “Your muscles need time to rest, recover and rebuild.” And be careful to stay hydrated, adds Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of wellbeing platform Cloudfit. " question_12_answer_2="You seem to have a good grasp of your overall health and are making positive decisions. But is there room for improvement? There is compelling evidence to suggest that alcohol in any amount can be detrimental to your long-term health. If you do drink, “only drink with meals (those who drink on an empty stomach are more likely to develop health problems) and drink slowly to allow your body to metabolise it”, says Dr Brian P Lee, hepatologist and liver transplant specialist with Keck Medicine of USC. “And stick to wine and beer: liquor has been associated with more health problems.”" question_12_answer_3='Your health could do with improvement. “Focus on what is under your control,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe, who points to a clinical trial that found that replacing “typical snacks” with almonds gave participants an “improvement in blood vessel function equivalent to a 30 per cent reduction in cardiovascular disease risk". Likewise with exercise: “Aim to move every 30 minutes,” says personal trainer Lavina Mehta. “Two hours of sitting will negate 20 minutes of exercise. Try hopping: 50 hops a day are great for supporting bone density, especially in women, who are more susceptible to osteoporosis and hip fractures.” ' question_12_answer_4="Uh-oh, you need to focus on some personal care. But rather than being overwhelmed, focus on making small changes first. “People get attached to the idea that they have to make radical changes,” says lifestyle transformation coach Fran Burns. “But actually it’s asking ourselves, what is the smallest micro-dose of action that I can take towards what I want? Can you put some leafy greens with every meal? Can you go to bed half an hour earlier tonight?” Likewise, when it comes to exercise, don’t try to run a marathon.

" question_4_results_text_2="“A lot can be done in an hour,” says Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of fitness app Cloudfit. “Prioritise compound movements (squats, push-ups, deadlifts, rows) – exercises that work multiple muscle movements.” Don’t have an hour? Sprinkling exercise – squats, hops and star jumps – throughout the day is “just as effective, if not more effective, as a long workout”, says personal trainer Lavina Mehta.  " question_4_results_text_3="“Aim for a variety of training methods,” says Kristian Phillips, co-founder and CEO of wellbeing platform Cloudfit. “Resistance training helps to build muscle and longevity.

Bitter foods – grapefruits, cacao, rocket – are really rich in phytonutrients and help simulate certain hormones that help us feel fuller, digest better and break down proteins.” " question_6_results_text_4="“The minimum thing you can do is finish your food two hours before you go to bed,” says transformational coach Fran Burns. “Our digestive system uses energy, so if it’s doing that while you’re asleep, it’s not doing the stuff we need, such as getting rid of cells that aren’t functioning anymore.”" question_6_results_text_5="“If I was to suggest one nutrient to increase, it would be fibre: beans, pulses, legumes,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King's College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “Ninety six per cent of people in the UK don’t get enough. Start with baked beans and work your way up. You may reduce your blood pressure, improve your mental health, increase your energy levels and reduce in the long term your risk of chronic diseases.”" question_6_results_text_6="“Embrace a whole foods philosophy, meaning lean proteins, whole grains, fruits and vegetables,” says Dr Marci Laudenslager, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “The best nutrition approach is one that is sustainable”.

Ball your hand up into a fist: that is a good visual cue of how much protein you want to be eating at meals.” And that doesn’t have to be one type per meal – “some chopped tofu with a couple of eggs scrambled together would make a good amount”." question_7_results_text_2="You can get what you need “as long as you’re mixing the three main plant-based sources of protein, whole grains, legumes and nuts and seeds”, says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “There is some evidence to show that plant-based sources might not be absorbed quite as well as meat. I would typically suggest getting about one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you might want to consider getting 1.1g or 1.2g per kilogram.”" question_7_results_text_3="“Make the right choices,” says Professor Sarah Berry, a nutritional scientist at King’s College London and chief scientist at nutrition app Zoe. “A low-fat Greek yoghurt is a great source of protein without the saturated fat.

Even very low [amounts of] alcohol are associated with lower life expectancy.”" question_8_results_text_2="Avoid alcohol when you need rest and mental clarity most. “It’s a toxin, so your body has to get rid of it quite quickly,” says Dr Jason Ellis, a professor in psychology at Northumbria University. That means heating up the body to sweat it out, leading to fragmented sleep. “We wake up feeling sleep-deprived, dehydrated and miserable because REM [rapid eye movement] sleep is about emotional regulation.” " question_8_results_text_3="“Seventy per cent of the population drink alcohol – we have to think about what’s palatable,” says Dr Brian P Lee, hepatologist and liver transplant specialist with Keck Medicine of USC. “Only drink with meals (those who drink on an empty stomach are more likely to develop health problems) and drink slowly to allow your body to metabolise it appropriately.” Lastly, he says: “stick to wine and beer: liquor has been associated with more health problems.”" question_8_results_text_4="This isn’t just a strain on your liver – alcohol is connected to seven types of cancer. “Your risk of oral cancer, for example, goes up by five-fold if you drink 70 units a week,” says Professor Kevin Moore, principal clinical research fellow at University College London. “For moderate drinkers – 20-30 units a week – the impact on your life expectancy is about four years. If you’re in your 20s, that’s nothing. But when you’re in your late 60s, it becomes a quarter of your lifespan.”" question_9="How often do you eat prepared meals outside the home (restaurants, takeaway, work canteen)?" question_9_answer_1="One to three times per month" question_9_answer_2="One to three times per week" question_9_answer_3="More than three times a week" question_9_category_text="Nutrition" question_9_results_text_1="If you feel like you're craving something, it doesn't mean you can’t have it, says Dr Emily Leeming, a dietitian and scientist at King’s College London. “But think about pairing [it] with an apple or a handful of nuts – you're getting that fix, but balancing it with healthy fats, fibre and protein to help you stay fuller for longer.”" question_9_results_text_2="If you’re eating fast food, “start with a salad – literally a handful of greens,” says transformational coach Fran Burns. “Not only does it activate your digestive enzyme so that your body is more prepared, but it’s also going to carry that pizza or burger through your system in a more efficient way. It just makes the load on the body a little bit lighter.”" question_9_results_text_3="“No cuisine is healthier than another – diversity is the thing,” says nutritionist Kat Chan. “If you can count the number of fun, zingy, crunchy, sour, spicy toppings, it's probably quite good for you.

As with all wellness-industry innovations, the term is vulnerable to abuse by woo-woo pseudo-scientists, amateur biohackers and snake oil salespeople promising instant immortality for a modest monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief – and to be fair, the term is misleading in this context – longevity is not necessarily about making you live longer. Or it’s not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; about making you live longer. It’s about helping you live healthier, so that if you do live longer, you will also live better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Clinique La Prairie they base their pursuit of longevity on four pillars: Medical Care, Nutrition, Movement and Wellbeing. Over the coming months, I’m going to have a go at changing my approach to all of those – without completely forswearing all pleasure. On a hot day, I’ll have a cold beer. And then at the end we’ll see if it’s made any difference to my odds of long-term survival.

Like an anti-ageing elixir poured into a chipped mug, the notion was decanted directly from the brain of the editor of &lt;em&gt;HTSI&lt;/em&gt; over a recent lunch. An act of charity, and an act of mischief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charity because after 14 years as a glossy magazine honcho myself, I recently hung up my editing boots – bespoke, cashmere-lined – and I think she was concerned I needed a project to keep me out of the pub. Mischief because I have not by any stretch lived a life of delayed gratification. Self-denial is as alien to me as Yoda. I am the best person to do this because I am the worst person to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think you need to know every detail I shared with the medics at Clinique La Prairie as they assessed my current health and fitness. But step four of the 12 taken by the acknowledged addict requires those in recovery to “make a searching and fearless” personal inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="o3-editorial-typography-list-unordered"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, very much so. At least a couple of glasses of wine every day, and sometimes more than a couple. I am not an alcoholic. But based on my week on the wagon in Switzerland, I accept that I am “alcohol-dependent”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drugs&lt;/strong&gt; Shall we say that in my younger days, like the great American musician John Prine, I sometimes wore an illegal smile? (“It don’t cost very much, but it lasts a long while.”) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking&lt;/strong&gt; I am addicted to nicotine and have been since I was 15. I stubbed out the cigs for good a couple of years ago and replaced them with vapes. Better, but still colossally stupid. And not a great look for a man of my seniority (I’m 52).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; I am addicted to coffee. I had a headache for the duration of my time in Montreux – the consequence, I was assured, of abruptly cutting off my espresso supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet&lt;/strong&gt; A disaster. I eat red meat in some form every other day, on average. I could murder a burger &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. I love fried food. My last meal before I left for Switzerland was at J Sheekey, in Covent Garden: fish and chips. I am addicted to sugar. My love of snacking is so well advertised that, when I left my magazine job in March, among my presents was a biscuit tin. I eat too much processed food: too many crisps, too much chocolate, not enough fruit and vegetables. I don’t drink enough water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you count freaky dancing – I do, but medical science is slow to catch up with the chemical generation – I did no exercise of any kind until I turned 40. At which point, motivated by vanity alone, I began to work out with a trainer, and to run a couple of times each week. I also – temporarily, it turned out – gave up smoking and cut down on carbs. That all hit a wall in 2022, when I slipped a disc in my back. Surgery fixed it but left me with bouts of sciatica that I treat twice weekly with Pilates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medication&lt;/strong&gt; I take statins for cholesterol, as well as additional medication (Ezetimibe, Inclisiran) because my fatty lipids are the result of genetic rather than &lt;em&gt;lifestyle factors&lt;/em&gt;. (Lifestyle factors: ain’t that your favourite euphemism?) I take a daily aspirin to thin the blood. All pretty standard stuff, I think, for a man of my age, background and inclinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first day in Switzerland I underwent a biologic and metabolic assessment. This measures glycans (the level of chronic inflammation and immune health), ceramides (a marker for cardiovascular health), genetic predispositions, and DNA microbiota (the bacteria in the gut). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, which I awaited with trepidation bordering on blind panic, were encouraging. I’ve hardly lived the life of Keith Richards – I’m a spoilt journalist, not a buccaneering rock star – but given my capacity for indulgence, I’m in pretty good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the medication, my LDL stats are still sub-optimal. The prescription: more exercise, to “increase high-density lipoprotein”. My sodium level could use some attention: less salt, more water. My uric acid score is a little high: charcuterie is off the menu. The doctor, a twinkly man with salt and pepper stubble, suggested I consider a vitamin D supplement. And he pretty much forbade me to even look at a croissant for as long as I live. (Duration TBC.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to the physical exams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My “physique rating”, measuring “visceral fat” and muscle mass, pronounced me “healthy”. All metrics were at “acceptable” or “average” levels. In fact, I have the “body composition” of a man of 45, seven years my junior. Get in! Maybe a pint and a packet of pork scratchings to toast my continued good health? Maybe not, says the doc. An average man of 45 still has much to do to stay fit. And, anyway, who wants to be average? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m in decent condition but not in great shape. I have a modest paunch and what my erstwhile colleague Will Self once described – in print, if you please – as “incipient jowls”. That was a few years back; I accept they may now be more fully realised. The CLP aesthetician picked up on this: apparently, I’m a good candidate for a Focused Ultrasound treatment on my jawline, such as it is, and I could use some Coolsculpting on my abdomen. Charming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A1b18ab27-976b-4dab-9fe0-dc356e8cd597?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=490&amp;amp;dpr=4 4x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F40571ff5-a2e0-4d59-974e-4c277558ef87.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;© Peter Flude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll swerve the beauty treatments and stick to the four pillars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I have mentioned to friends that I’m working on this story, at least half of them – an unscientific sample, granted – have referred to the megarich super-crank Bryan Johnson, subject of the grimly compelling Netflix documentary &lt;em&gt;Don’t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever&lt;/em&gt;. Am I, like Johnson, they wonder, going to attempt to “neutralise ageing” by waking at 4.30am to work out, swallowing more than 100 pills daily and exchanging my tired old blood for the “young plasma” of my son?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not. I don’t have the time, the money, or the desire. And Oscar Bilmes (aged 12) doesn’t like needles; I asked, he demurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson is trying to cheat death. It sometimes seems that, like Liam Gallagher (in this only), he wants to live forever. That’s his business. It’s literally his business: he is a wellness entrepreneur and investor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no guarantee I’ll live longer as a result of following CLP’s advice. It’s impossible to know how long I’d live if I carry on as I have been, and even if I were to switch to Johnsonian levels of self-control (and self-absorption), we can’t know exactly what effect that would have. I might be run over by an autonomous taxi – and so might Bryan Johnson – before this story even makes it into print. Which would be inconvenient although, as I pointed out to the &lt;em&gt;HTSI &lt;/em&gt;editors, it would make for an eye-catching headline: “Longevity Columnist Dead at 52: Witnesses Confirm He Didn’t See it Coming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over lunch in Montreux, Simone Gibertoni, the CEO of Clinique La Prairie, assured me that his clinic could not and would not guarantee long life for its clients – that’s beyond even the dapper Gibertoni. What they do is identify risk factors and areas for improvement. Each patient is given a specific programme, tailor-made for them, based on factors both genetic and epigenetic. (Genetic is the hand that fate deals you; epigenetic is how you play that hand.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not paying £18,000-plus just to be told to put down your sausage sandwich and get back on the treadmill. Gibertoni stressed the fact that a week in Montreux was not a cure-all. Some visitors have serious long-term health issues – it’s a hospital, after all – while others are here for spoiling spa treatments in a picturesque setting. Some come – he was looking at me here, but in a kindly way – for an annual purge and imagine they can return to their sybaritic lifestyles safe in the knowledge that they’ve done their bit for better health. That’s not how it works. (Damn.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you live long enough,” said another Simone (de Beauvoir), “you’ll see that every victory turns into a defeat.” I don’t know it that’s correct. I haven’t lived long enough yet to find out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eat grass, walk around,” says the twinkly medic at our final consultation. Sounds easy. But if you’ve spent close to 40 years, as I have, indolently filling your gob with Monster Munch, Marlboro Lights and cheap European lager, contemplating a future of kale, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/379a464a-2f00-417f-acc1-e0a2bed77b69" data-trackable="link"&gt;kombucha&lt;/a&gt; and vigorous exercise is sobering – literally sobering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like an antioxidant shot, personal transformation is a pain in the bum. But, as with growing old, it’s probably better than the alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How healthy is your lifestyle? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ft.com/editor/5a74e48f-7450-44a5-8f79-6fedfd06664a" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take our quiz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and join Alex Bilmes on his quest at the Longevity Project at ft.com/the longevityproject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:30:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5PRGZoM0JqN1Bld1JvdVo1NUY3MFhUd3hWUmpPNkRLN3ViV2FnaXlZdERYRzliWXBPZjAyZU9QelRLQ0Q2bDhuZ3NyMldNWU0xdHhhQmF1bERKeFhHb3d6Mk8tN2pRLU84bC1aVnJGU2o</guid></item><item><title>当医生解释发生了什么时， Ozempic的使用正在引起令人担忧的卧室副作用- LADbible | Ozempic use is causing worrying bedroom side effect as doctor explains what is going on - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPTFBYRHRONktlSFNIVHNsT3pqOGMyaUdncEUtTlRDVTR1alV5dUtNWms0bjhtbk1pM1hGd0NnQk16Y0tVMmEwWVlFUDZmbUhEeGctYzYwc29XTlU2VmVFV2Z0cE5GZTQzekFuekp0cWhzTnlOdGZ5dV9sbkhpUVBjQ2RtMHRBNDlFV2FEaHlOblBvZWFrZEwxY1E3TUgyVmZNQlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;An Ozempic user has revealed one unexpected side effect that's 'causing issues in their relationship'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While many people are having a lot of success taking GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy, the drugs have a wide range of potential &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-mounjaro-wegovy-five-major-side-effects-654406-20250604"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Ozempic in particular - which is designed to treat type 2 diabetes and has not been approved in the UK for weight loss - led &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/jeremy-clarkson"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; to have some pretty horrible sickness, while others have noticed changes in their &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-osteoporosis-weight-loss-doctor-health-451597-20250603"&gt;muscle strength&lt;/a&gt;, face structure and even in their downstairs area after being on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Although you might expect that an improvement in cardiovascular health and body weight might well lead to more success in the bedroom, some users on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; are now suggesting that their sex drive is 'completely gone' after taking the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;GLP-1 medications are on the rise (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The original poster &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ia1zjj/absolutely_no_sex_drive_on_ozempic/?force_seo=1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: "I've been on Ozempic for a few months now and I love it.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every year, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-your-seasonal-allergies-seem-way-worse-right-now-1851395471"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pollen seasons grow longer and more intense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—to the great misery of those suffering from pollen allergies—myself included. There’s only so much one can do with antihistamines or hot towels, and no amount of protective measures—masks, firmly shut windows, you name it—appears to offer any protection from the endless sneezing, runny noses, and itchy eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what if, by spraying something akin to a nasal spray, you could thwart the onslaught of those pesky allergens before they latch onto your sensitive nasal passages? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was the “simple but powerful idea” that inspired &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kaznaru.edu.kz/en/sciences/agrotechnical-hubs/3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kaissar Tabynov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who led the efforts to create a “molecular shield” that intercepts allergens the moment they approach our airways. For the experiment, they targeted mugwort pollen, which is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267181/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;most common cause of pollen allergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Central Asia and Europe. Tabynov and colleagues reported the first proof-of-principle for this technology, in this instance with mice, in a paper published today in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1595659/full"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Allergies are often viewed as inconvenient but minor conditions, yet for millions, they severely reduce quality of life and can even be life-threatening,” Tabynov, director of the International Center for Vaccinology at Kazakh National Agrarian Research University in Kazakhstan, told Gizmodo in an email. “We believe this could be the beginning of a new class of anti-allergy interventions—smart, fast, and easy to use—that could protect people during allergy season in a way no existing therapy does.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how the “shield” works. Researchers first develop a monoclonal antibody, or a lab-made protein designed to attach to a specific molecule. In this case it’s aimed at a major allergy-causing protein found in mugwort pollen. These antibodies are applied to the nose, effectively snatching the allergens away from our natural antibodies, which trigger allergic responses when bound with allergens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The immune system is an intricate network of cells and hormones, so adjusting the treatment such that it wouldn’t disrupt the natural system of mice proved to be a major challenge, explained Tabynov. Not only that, mugwort pollen is actually a combination of multiple allergy-causing particles (partly the reason they’re so insufferable), meaning Tabynov’s team had to focus on the most clinically relevant parts of the allergen complex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After several adjustments, the team succeeded in making an antibody treatment that curbed nasal inflammation and asthma symptoms in mice, and it did so without harming the animals’ natural antibodies. Although the duration of the treatment was shorter than Tabynov hoped, he told Gizmodo that he and his team have already devised a strategy to potentially make the treatment last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What’s exciting about our approach is that it shows how precise, targeted biologics can be used not just for chronic therapy but for prevention, delivered right where allergens strike,” Tabynov added. “Our approach is non-invasive, needle-free, and fast-acting [and] reduces the allergen load on the immune system and may help prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis into more severe conditions such as bronchial asthma.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As fellow pollen allergy sufferers are aware, allergic reactions tend to set off a chain reaction of misery throughout the body. The idea of blocking allergens before they ever reach the nose would be a huge relief for many patients, especially those with medical complications that prevent them from taking standard antihistamine pills. It’d also be a time-saving, cheaper alternative to immunotherapy sessions, which can take years to have any effect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, is this something we’ll be picking up at a local pharmacy any time soon? Depends. Tabynov’s most optimistic estimate is that the first human-based studies could happen within two to three years. Additional adjustments will be needed to extend the treatment’s protective effects on human nasal surfaces. But for lifelong pollen patients, it sounds like a promising start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then a pioneering experimental drug – 4‑hydroxybenzoate (4‑HB) – designed to bypass his genetic deficiency, not only halted his decline but restored his mobility in just weeks. Within weeks of compassionate‑use treatment approved by the FDA at NYU Langone, he walked again – hiking, go-karting, and playing with renewed vigor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This extraordinary case, the first human success for HPDL deficiency, signals a monumental shift in rare disease therapy, transforming despair into hope. It not only redefines treatment for HPDL deficiency but also shines a beacon of hope for rare mitochondrial diseases everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From an athlete to being &lt;keyword id="2282650" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="wheelchair-bound" source="Orion"&gt;wheelchair-bound&lt;/keyword&gt;: The onset of HPDL deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-2023, this otherwise healthy boy – a competitive runner and soccer enthusiast – started showing worrying signs: stumbling, ankle stiffness, and loss of coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began experiencing involuntary muscle contractions in his ankles while playing soccer. Within months, these symptoms escalated; by November, he needed a wheelchair and struggled even to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing at NYU Langone revealed biallelic mutations in the HPDL gene, essential for producing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a vital antioxidant for mitochondrial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPDL deficiency disrupts the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway, impairing cellular energy production. Without CoQ10, neurons and muscles lose function, leading to spasticity, paralysis, seizures, and often early death, with severe forms manifesting in infancy. In this child’s delayed-onset case, symptoms appeared later but progressed swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The CoQ10 conundrum: Why supplements aren’t enough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoQ10 is widely available as a dietary supplement and is generally safe. However, CoQ10 supplements are completely ineffective in HPDL cases affecting the brain because CoQ10 molecules are too large and hydrophobic to cross the blood–brain barrier. Without reaching the brain, supplemental CoQ10 offered minimal benefit, essentially leaving the underlying condition unchecked. While CoQ10 supplements may help peripheral tissues, they leave neurological symptoms – spasticity, paralysis, and rapid degeneration – untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A biochemical breakthrough: Smart ‘tailor-made’ solution&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, researchers at NYU, led by Dr. Michael Pacold, discovered that HPDL catalyzes an early step in CoQ10 synthesis: converting 4‑hydroxy‑methyladenine (4‑HMA) to 4‑hydroxybenzoate (4‑HB), a precursor that is small and hydrophilic enough can cross the blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In HPDL-deficient mice, oral 4‑HB restored CoQ10 production, significantly improved neurological function, and rescued 90% of subjects when administered early. Translating this from mice to humans presented risks, but given the rapid deterioration and the absence of other options, the child's parents and medical team pursued a compassionate-use approval from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compassionate use in humans: Life-changing progress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By November 2023, with the boy’s condition worsening and time running out, NYU’s team – led by Dr. Claire Miller – obtained FDA approval for single-patient investigational use of 4‑HB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment began in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the boy began daily oral doses of 4‑HB dissolved in water. Initial mood and side effects varied – he experienced nausea occasionally – but the potential benefits were undeniable. Remarkably, within just a month, he regained the ability to walk and walked more than half a mile in Central Park. His progress was profound. Over the next year, he completed a four‑mile hike and even enjoyed go-karting – all without serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors report a significant restoration of motor function and stamina. The boy can complete his daily activities without assistance—though rigorous sports remain off-limits. There have been no severe side effects reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact and perspective: A medical breakthrough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case represents the first successful application of 4‑HB therapy in a human with HPDL deficiency. Classified by experts as a "bench-to-bedside" success, it demonstrates how basic biological insights – like metabolic pathways – can be translated into transformative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacold highlighted the value of NIH-funded foundational research: without it, 4‑HB’s pathway to human use wouldn’t exist. However, experts emphasize that while the results are unprecedented, caution remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient’s outcome isn’t enough to define safety or efficacy broadly. Nevertheless, the experimental treatment offers proof-of-principle and has prompted plans for larger clinical trials across ages and HPDL variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Broader implications for rare disease care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the potential of precision, mechanism-based therapies for ultra-rare genetic disorders – many of which lack approved treatments due to their complexity and small patient populations. It also illustrates how compassionate-use pathways can bridge the gap between preclinical research and patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For HPDL deficiency, this success sets the stage for larger clinical trials. Researchers are now exploring the treatment’s wider applicability and grappling with whether 4‑HB acts solely by restoring CoQ10 or if other mechanisms are at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A beacon of hope for rare disease communities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare genetic disorders often lack effective therapies due to low patient numbers and complex biology. This milestone highlights how customized, mechanism-based interventions can break new ground. It reiterates the importance of NIH-funded basic science – Pacold’s pathway elucidation stemmed from foundational grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Miller reflected on how “movement is identity and personality,” and described the turnaround as “heartwarming.” As the boy himself reportedly asked, "When are you going to make this a pill?" – a reminder of evolving patient-driven optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s ahead now? Next steps focus on clinical expansion: enrolling more pediatric patients, refining dosing, and assessing long-term outcomes. Scientists also aim to clarify whether 4‑HB works solely by boosting CoQ10 or also via unexpected mechanisms. Additionally, assessing whether similar treatments can address broader CoQ10 deficiencies is a promising, yet cautious, discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;This is how Aryan Khan spent the money in jail that he received from his father Shah Rukh Khan: Reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 03:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病：常见咳嗽糖浆可减缓认知能力下降和痴呆症-印度时报 | Parkinson’s disease: Common cough syrup revealed to slow down cognitive decline and dementia - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. It is narked not only by motor symptoms – such as tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia – but also by cognitive decline. PD is also characterized by the degeneration and death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger crucial for smooth and coordinated muscle movements. This loss of dopamine leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, up to half of people with PD develop Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) within a decade, with symptoms ranging from memory loss and confusion to hallucinations and mood disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, a groundbreaking phase 2 clinical trial has revealed that a common cough medicine can stabilize psychiatric symptoms and potentially slow cognitive decline in PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The recent discovery&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a clinical trial, Ambroxol, a common cough medicine (used in Europe), has shown promise in slowing cognitive decline in people with Parkinson’s disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 12-month study conducted by researchers at Lawson Research Institute found that Ambroxol helped stabilise psychiatric symptoms, improved cognitive function, and protected against brain damage in genetically at-risk participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2835760" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared the outcome of the expectorant Ambroxol with a placebo among participants with Parkinson’s disease dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While primary and secondary outcomes were similar, participants on the placebo experienced worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms compared to symptoms remaining the same in the intervention group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed a possible improvement in cognitive symptoms for people with variants of a particular gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Parkinson’s Dementia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease dementia is a progressive condition superimposed on the classic movement symptoms of PD. It typically manifests in the later stages of the disease and includes cognitive impairment – memory lapses, executive dysfunction, visual hallucinations, and mood disturbances like depression or apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 153,000 people in the UK live with PD. There is currently no cure for PDD, but patients can take medications called cholinesterase inhibitors to help manage symptoms. Existing treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine, donepezil) and memantine, may provide some symptomatic relief but fail to halt or alter the underlying neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambroxol: From cough syrup to neuroprotection&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol has been widely used in Europe for decades as a mucoactive agent – it helps clear phlegm and has an excellent safety profile. Its potential in neurodegenerative disease stems from its ability to enhance glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, a key enzyme encoded by the GBA1 gene. Reduced GCase activity leads to the build-up of alpha-synuclein, a hallmark of PD and PDD. By enhancing GCase, Ambroxol may promote the clearance of pathological proteins and reduce brain cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key findings from the phase 2 trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Lawson Research Institute conducted a 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 55 PDD patients, administering high-dose Ambroxol (525–1,050 mg/day). The major outcomes included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptom stabilization:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Placebo participants experienced significant worsening in neuropsychiatric measures, while those on Ambroxol remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Brain injury marker (GFAP):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serum GFAP – a biomarker of neuronal damage – increased in the placebo group but remained stable with Ambroxol, implying neuroprotective action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cognitive improvement in high-risk individuals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients harboring GBA1 risk variants exhibited noticeable cognitive gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safety and tolerance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ambroxol was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse effects noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One detailed report noted that high-dose Ambroxol recipients showed improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores by approximately 2 points, while placebo subjects declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and the way ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While findings are promising, they come from a small, single-center Phase 2 trial with limited diversity and may not be fully statistically conclusive. Certain dose‑response relationships remain unclear, and the subset of GBA1 carriers was small – about eight participants.

While it’s true that risk increases with age, it’s a myth that young people are immune. In fact, certain cancers are rising among younger adults, including colon cancer and breast cancer. More people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are being diagnosed—and it’s not always due to genetics. Environmental factors, lifestyle changes, and even unknown triggers may be playing a role. That’s why awareness matters at every age. If you're young and you notice something off—unexplained fatigue, weight loss, bleeding, or a lump—don’t brush it off. Doctors are now encouraging earlier screenings in many cases for a reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 02:01:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>可能是心脏病征兆的无声症状- AOL.com | The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBjNjNWWlVUN3FxbkpBUm5mMkRQTWpPbV9JUk81TjBOUFFZQ3ZiUkNMTmp5RXFFMEswQmFZdWdqaXNjMUJPU3dOVC1ydHBYRm1pOEVDSXNXYUZiQWU0QzAtV3lHd2hjOHpUYzF2ckM1WTNfQlZu?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death among U.S. adults, a distinction it's held for a century. Yet, despite the pain it's caused, there are still some significant misconceptions about &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-eating-lunch-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, such as that cardiovascular issues are limited to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-thing-you-should-never-do-if-you-want-to-lower-heart-attack-risk-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;. On TV, heart attacks are often portrayed as sudden, spontaneous and involving chest pain as the first symptom of a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, heart disease includes a range of conditions, including &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/i-lowered-my-high-blood-pressure-here-is-how-i-did-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. The first signs that there's an issue can also be silent. However, cardiologists are making a loud call for people to pay attention to the subtle clues of heart trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Heart disease is one of the most common and potentially serious medical conditions," explains &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center. "Evaluating potential heart problems can prevent them from getting worse, and maybe even save your life."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Understanding this often-overlooked and silent sign of heart trouble is one way to protect yourself. Cardiologists discuss the symptom, why it's easy to miss and what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺 &lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/a&gt; 💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The No. 1 Silent Sign of Heart Trouble, Cardiologists Warn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists reveal that fatigue can be easily overlooked as a sign of a potential heart issue, and it's especially prevalent among specific individuals. "Women and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/vegetable-diabetes-prevention-study-march-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people with diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;people with diabetes&lt;/a&gt; may not have typical symptoms, and they may only note fatigue, nausea or 'just not feeling right,'" says &lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bradley Serwer, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Bradley Serwer, MD&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an &lt;a href="http://www.ingenovishealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ingenovis Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ingenovis Health&lt;/a&gt; company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/warning-signs-of-heart-failure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; and a 2023 study in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8795245/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Cardiac Failure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of Cardiac Failure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; both report that fatigue and extreme tiredness are common signs of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the heart muscle is weakened, it may not be able to pump as much blood as the body needs, leading to fatigue," explains &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Randy Gould, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Randy Gould, DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and contributor to &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:labfinder.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;labfinder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Serwer adds that conditions like congestive heart failure can lead to a buildup in the lungs that complicates this oxygen exchange, triggering chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. The shortness of breath can also affect sleep, setting off a vicious cycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Many times, lying down makes people short of breath, and they often have to sleep sitting up," he says. "This results in inefficient sleep, which then presents as fatigue."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-to-your-blood-pressure-when-you-eat-blueberries-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here’s What Happens to Your Blood Pressure When You Eat Blueberries Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here’s What Happens to Your Blood Pressure When You Eat Blueberries Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why It's Easy To Miss Fatigue as a Sign of Heart Problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, people may write off chronic fatigue as "simply" poor sleep, hence why this sign of heart trouble seems silent. Dr. Gould notes that people may also attribute their fatigue to stress or aging, and Dr. Serwer reports that people often think they can white-knuckle through extreme tiredness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We often think that fatigue will simply go away on its own," Dr. Serwer reveals. "We are taught that chest pain, severe shortness of breath or even passing out may be due to a heart attack. When people experience less dramatic symptoms, they often get minimized and overlooked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, does this mean fatigue is &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;a sign of a heart issue? No, but Dr. Chen says it's worth exploring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fatigue is a common symptom that can be due to many possible reasons, including both lifestyle factors and medical conditions," he explains. "It is sometimes difficult to determine the cause without a comprehensive medical evaluation."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-eating-lunch-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do in the Hour After Eating Lunch, According to a Cardiologist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do in the Hour After Eating Lunch, According to a Cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When Fatigue Is a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you just tired or dealing with a heart issue? For starters, if in doubt, get checked out. That said, heart-related fatigue can have a distinct feel. "Patients usually state that they feel tired all the time, and increased sleep/rest does not improve their symptoms," Dr. Gould says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about how much effort you need to do a daily task. "The symptoms [of fatigue] are out of proportion to the amount of effort expended," Dr. Serwer says. "As the symptoms progress, the patient often says that they can’t even complete normal activities of daily living such as dressing, cooking or cleaning. They often complain of brain fatigue, which can be a result of low oxygen levels."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-people-with-hypertension-should-break-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cardiologists Are Begging People With Hypertension To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cardiologists Are Begging People With Hypertension To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Easy-to-Miss Signs of Heart Trouble and What To Do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme fatigue isn't the only sign of heart trouble. Dr. Chen also warns that signs you or a loved one is experiencing a cardiovascular issue include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Serwer is begging people to take his advice to heart: "Pay attention to the symptoms and do not ignore them," he advises. "Depending on the symptoms, an emergent or urgent medical evaluation is important. If the emergency room providers don’t identify a heart attack or an immediate life-threatening condition, they may refer the patient to a cardiologist for a more detailed workup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/relaxing-habit-harming-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: I'm a Cardiologist, and This 'Relaxing' Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: I'm a Cardiologist, and This 'Relaxing' Habit Is Actually Harming Your Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Heart Trouble&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jul 10, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-heart-condition-sign-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jul 10, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 23:57:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBjNjNWWlVUN3FxbkpBUm5mMkRQTWpPbV9JUk81TjBOUFFZQ3ZiUkNMTmp5RXFFMEswQmFZdWdqaXNjMUJPU3dOVC1ydHBYRm1pOEVDSXNXYUZiQWU0QzAtV3lHd2hjOHpUYzF2ckM1WTNfQlZu</guid></item><item><title>50岁之前非常简单的生活方式改变可显著改善大脑健康和衰老- Earth.com | Very simple lifestyle change before the age of 50 dramatically improves brain health and aging - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNclJtZzQtcFEzYmJfWFdXRWJ5b29pWngwbDFtRXUtbllqTTJRby12RUZIbmZCVFpxbE1UcU9BcUpKeVZ1cm5TUTBLV2xHVTlYQjB2WXNobFpvZU1OQkdFX19xZ0I0V3NfekZydmZPTlVJUWVRT1lfOXVfQXk4THFyS28xQUNjQ2Zqd3dtNHgxYVllYW1SdlQ3cU9fcTBIT3Zia2RWZzZZNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent study, people who managed to fit regular exercise into their month while they were still under 50 now carry brains that look noticeably younger at 70. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding comes from &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/research-clinical-trials/insight-46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insight  46 project&lt;/a&gt;, which has tracked almost 500 members of Britain’s 1946 birth cohort for nearly eight decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/59397-sarah-james" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Sarah-Naomi James&lt;/a&gt; of University College London’s &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/dementia-research-centre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dementia Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; led the work and calls it a reminder that, “staying active throughout your life, especially before turning 50, can help keep your brain healthy and delay early signs of Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-activity-and-exercise"&gt;Brain activity and exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at how often each volunteer reported leisure‑time activity between ages 36 and 69. One session a month was all it took to be classed as “active,” yet even that light commitment predicted larger volumes in the hippocampus, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;brain’s&lt;/a&gt; chief memory hub. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also compared cognitive test scores with early Alzheimer markers like amyloid build‑up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who kept moving scored higher even when those markers were present, suggesting exercise builds mental resilience rather than erasing the pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults typically lose about one to two percent of hippocampal volume every year. Aerobic training can add roughly two percent back, effectively buying an extra year or two of neurological youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3072565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; link that gain to boosts in blood flow, new neuron growth, and surges of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that primes synapses for learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human scans echo the trend, showing fitter seniors with denser hippocampal tissue and sharper spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-and-hidden-alzheimer-s"&gt;Exercise and hidden Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Insight 46 scans did not find a direct link between activity and the amount of amyloid lodged in the brain’s cortex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That matches other population &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31312836/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; where exercise softened the cognitive hit of amyloid without always lowering the plaques themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23079557/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; think movement may raise the threshold at which damage turns into symptoms, a concept known as cognitive reserve. Reserve acts like a backup network, letting healthy circuits pick up slack when disease strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-following-participants-for-70-years"&gt;Following participants for 70 years&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Insight 46 study is part of the world’s longest-running birth cohort, the 1946 &lt;a href="https://nshd.mrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British National Survey of Health and Development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants have been assessed regularly since childhood, providing researchers with a rare, detailed view of their lifelong health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 70, five hundred and two of these individuals underwent memory testing, PET scans to detect amyloid, and MRI scans to assess brain volume and hippocampal size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination of decades-long physical activity records and brain imaging allowed researchers to connect early-life exercise habits with structural and functional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-literally-changes-based-on-daily-activities-and-lifestyle/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; markers nearly 40 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-show-bigger-benefits"&gt;Women show bigger benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women in the study saw the strongest benefits. Inactive women with amyloid deposits showed steeper memory loss than inactive men, yet a modest exercise habit erased much of that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal shifts after menopause and higher baseline Alzheimer risk may make female brains more sensitive to lifestyle. That &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/12/701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; means the upside of activity could be bigger too, offering a practical target for prevention campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise joins education, mentally demanding work, and social connection as major reserve builders. Each factor strengthens neural networks in different ways, so combining them multiplies protection over decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nearly half of dementia cases can be prevented or delayed by addressing health and lifestyle risk factors,” notes researcher &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/research/online-public-events/for-a-cure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Thomas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate 2020 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7392084/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; estimated that up to forty percent of dementia cases could be delayed or avoided by tackling modifiable risks, with physical inactivity sitting near the top of the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-for-your-brain-before-50"&gt;Exercise for your brain before 50&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need marathon medals to reap &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-the-speed-at-which-the-brain-processes-information/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; dividends. The study’s cutoff of one leisure session per month hints that consistency beats intensity for long‑term payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting after 50 still helped but earlier movers enjoyed the largest hippocampi at 70, implying that earlier habits leave a structural imprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cardiorespiratory-fitness-cuts-early-death-risks-by-53-percent/"&gt;Cardiorespiratory&lt;/a&gt; fitness later in life can still blunt the link between Alzheimer biomarkers and thinking decline, yet earlier routines give extra cushioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health guidelines call for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity each week, but any added movement counts. Regular walks, cycling to errands, or weekend dance classes all meet the threshold and most involve no special gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great to run with people because you keep each other accountable and stay connected,” said Graham Kent, a 74‑year‑old participant, while caring for his wife who lives with Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging friends or pets can double as social enrichment, another pillar of reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message lands clearly: move early, move often, and keep moving. A future cure would be welcome, but personal prevention starts with the next stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/1/fcae431/7933115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 23:05:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNclJtZzQtcFEzYmJfWFdXRWJ5b29pWngwbDFtRXUtbllqTTJRby12RUZIbmZCVFpxbE1UcU9BcUpKeVZ1cm5TUTBLV2xHVTlYQjB2WXNobFpvZU1OQkdFX19xZ0I0V3NfekZydmZPTlVJUWVRT1lfOXVfQXk4THFyS28xQUNjQ2Zqd3dtNHgxYVllYW1SdlQ3cU9fcTBIT3Zia2RWZzZZNA</guid></item><item><title>“自动对焦”规格可保证近距离或远距离的锐利视野- BBC | 'Autofocus' specs promise sharp vision, near or far - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE95bzBPb1NKS0ZfOVJBUzhEZTlKelQ1ZVpROTdKSVMwa2RkVTAwZTJQb3N3YUJyUHVEZm5ZeTVPSlM0bkdrZXAxZE1zZk5kWE1kakJhVlVxVGhyd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1qUXV6cXdEYkVOM3FuZEx3Y2hWb1hjdTMxUmJKM2I4Q3NJcGw5dnJpNFVXSldxVld2SkhkNjhhNl9JbmllV1E5Umh5cll1eEtJX1REN3JnWlhxVFNiVHJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'Autofocus' specs promise sharp vision, near or far&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Chris Baraniuk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology Reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8d1/live/c37140d0-414a-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.png.webp" loading="eager" alt="IXI Niko Eiden, smiling and wearing IXI's autofocus specs." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;IXI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;"People don't want to look like cyborgs," says Niko Eiden&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They look like an ordinary pair of glasses – but these are tech-packed specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On a Zoom call, Niko Eiden, chief executive and co-founder of Finnish eyewear firm IXI, holds up the frames with lenses containing liquid crystals, meaning their vision-correcting properties can change on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This one pair could correct the vision of someone who normally uses totally different pairs of glasses for seeing near or far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These liquid crystals… we can rotate them with an electrical field," explains Mr Eiden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's totally, freely tuneable." The position of those crystals affects the passage of light through the lenses. A built-in eye-tracker allows the glasses to respond to whatever correction the wearer needs at a given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, tech-laden eyewear &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-30830265" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;has a troubled history&lt;/a&gt; – take Google's ill-fated "Glass" smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Consumer acceptability is key, acknowledges Mr Eiden.

And myopia, or short-sightedness, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8g4xpjz65o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is also on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Spectacles have remained largely the same for decades. Bifocal lenses – in which a lens is split into two regions, usually for either near- or far-sightedness – require the wearer to direct their vision through the relevant region, depending on what they want to look at, in order to see clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Varifocals do a similar job but the transitions are much smoother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In contrast, auto-focus lenses promise to adjust part or all of the lens spontaneously, and even accommodate the wearer's changing eyesight over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The first lenses that we produced were horrible," admits Mr Eiden, candidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those early prototypes were "hazy", he says, and with the lens quality noticeably poor at its edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But newer versions have proved promising in tests, says Mr Eiden. Participants in the company's trials have been asked, for example, to read something on a page, then look at an object in the distance, to see whether the glasses respond smoothly to the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Eiden says that the eye tracking device within the spectacles cannot determine exactly what a wearer is looking at, though certain activities such as reading are in principle detectable because of the nature of eye movements associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since such glasses respond so closely to the wearer's eye behaviour, it's important the frames fit well, says Emilia Helin, product director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;IXI's frames are adjustable but not to a great degree, given the delicate electronics inside, she explains: "We have some flexibility but not full flexibility." That's why IXI hopes to ensure that the small range of frames it has designed would suit a wide variety of faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The small battery secreted inside IXI's autofocus frames should last for two days, says Mr Eiden, adding that it's possible to recharge the specs overnight while the wearer is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he won't be drawn on a launch date, which he intends to reveal later this year. As for cost, I ask whether £1,000 might be the sort of price tag he has in mind. He merely says, "I'm smiling when you say it but I won't confirm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A mother tries on glasses in a store with her young daughter" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals, says Paramdeep Bilkhu, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he adds, "There is insufficient evidence to state whether they perform as well as traditional options and whether they can be used for safety critical tasks such as driving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chi-Ho To, an optometry researcher, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has a similar concern – what if the vision correction went wrong or was delayed slightly while he was, say, performing surgery on someone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But I think in terms of general use having something that allows autofocusing is a good idea," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Eiden notes that the first version of his company's lenses will not alter the entire lens area. "One can always glance over the dynamic area," he says. If wholly self-adjusting lenses emerge then safety will become "a much more serious business", he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2013, UK firm Adlens released glasses that allowed wearers to manually change the optical power of the lenses via a small dial on the frames. These lenses contained a fluid-filled membrane, which when compressed in response to dial adjustments would alter its curvature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Adlens' current chief executive Rob Stevens says the specs sold for $1,250 (£920) in the US and were "well received by consumers" but not so much by opticians, which he says "strangled sales".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since then, technology has moved on and the concept of lenses that refocus themselves automatically, without manual interventions, has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Like IXI and other companies, Adlens is working on glasses that do this. However, Mr Stevens declines to confirm a launch date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Joshua Silver, an Oxford University physicist, founded Adlens but no longer works for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He came up with the idea of fluid-filled adjustable lenses back in 1985 and developed glasses that could be tuned to the wearer's needs and then permanently set to that prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Such lenses have enabled roughly 100,000 people in 20 countries to  access vision correcting technology. Prof Silver is currently seeking investment for a venture called Vision, which would further rollout these glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As for more expensive, electronics-filled auto-focus specs, he questions whether they will have broad appeal: "Wouldn't [people] just go and buy reading glasses, which would more or less do the same thing for them?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881a/live/3756e680-414b-11f0-835b-310c7b938e84.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hong Kong Polytechnic University Prof Chi-Ho To holding up a lens." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Hong Kong Polytechnic University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Prof Chi-Ho To has developed a lens which slows short-sightedness&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Other specs tech is even slowing down the progression of eye conditions such as myopia, beyond just correcting for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof To &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32700-7" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;has developed glasses lenses&lt;/a&gt; that have a honeycomb-like ring in them. Light passing through the centre of the ring, focused as normal, reaches the wearer's retina and allows them to see clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, light passing through the ring itself is defocused slightly meaning that the peripheral retina &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.myopiafocus.org/hyperopic-defocus-blur" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;gets a slightly blurred image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This appears to slow improper eyeball growth in children, which Prof To says cuts the rate of short-sightedness progression by 60%.

   &lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Decades of progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS are in danger of unraveling, the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warned Thursday in its annual report, citing sharp funding cuts from major donors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/UNAIDS-global-AIDS-update-2025" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, launched in South Africa by UNAIDS, says those cuts — especially the sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding — are threatening to reverse gains that have saved millions of lives over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If the world doesn't plug this hole," said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, "we estimate that an additional six million people will be newly infected in the next four years. We could have four million additional AIDS-related deaths."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The reports warning comes five months after the Trump administration&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/25/g-s1-44762/pepfar-trump-hiv-foreign-aid" target="_blank"&gt; halted most funding&lt;/a&gt; for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — the largest single contributor to the global HIV/AIDS response. The decision was made with little warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The sudden withdrawal of the single biggest HIV donor is putting this progress at risk," Byanyima said during a press briefing in Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the start of the epidemic, UNAIDS says 26.9 million lives have been saved through treatment efforts — many of them in sub-Saharan Africa, the region most affected by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77071" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Fallout in South Africa and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;South Africa, which has the world's largest population of people living with HIV, has made major strides. Most of those infected now receive life-saving antiretroviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the fallout is already being felt. At the report's launch, South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi called the U.S. cuts "a wake-up call" — and warned of the dangers of depending on a single donor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This type of relationship where we depend on one country, and when that country is in some type of negative mood, the whole world collapses — yes, it's scary," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Scientific setbacks and a call to action&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;South African researchers have been at the forefront of global HIV breakthroughs as well as COVID-19 studies. But many trials are now being suspended due to lack of funds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Helen Rees, head of the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg, said the implications are global.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The research being done for HIV and tuberculosis in South Africa has not only had an impact here, but a huge global impact," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rees was recently honored by the World Health Organization for her "outstanding contribution to public health," but her institute is now facing major U.S. funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Not charity" — a shared fight&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trump has said &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462613/africa-leaders-trump-white-house-china-minerals-oil" target="_blank"&gt;the shift away from U.S. aid &lt;/a&gt;reflects a new emphasis on "trade over charity" in Africa. But UNAIDS' Byanyima says the sudden withdrawal of U.S. support in February has left UNAIDS with nearly 50% less funding — and no time to prepare for the gap.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is not charity," she said. "This is solving a global problem together. As long as it festers in some parts of the world, it will come back to hit everybody else."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For longtime HIV activist Nombeko Mpongo in Cape Town, the cuts have felt deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I remember for a few days I felt suffocated, I felt like being choked… It was like a volcano came and took everything away. It felt like a death penalty," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But after the shock, Mpongo says she rallied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I realized — no man, nonsense. Let me fight. Let me reach out to the communities," she said. "We've fought this virus before. We'll do it again, because hope is what is going to carry us through."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiving six or more prescriptions of the drug gabapentin for low back pain is associated with significantly increased risks of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)—29% and 85%, respectively—finds a large medical records study published online in the journal &lt;i&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;What's more, these risks were more than twice as high in those normally considered too young to develop either condition—18–64-year-olds—the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike opioids, gabapentin has relatively low addictive potential, and it has become increasingly popular for the treatment of chronic pain, especially &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuropathic+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuropathic pain&lt;/a&gt;, as it offers potentially neuroprotective benefits, point out the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But concerns are beginning to emerge about its side effects, including a possible association with neurodegeneration, although the findings to date have been mixed, including whether particular age groups might be more vulnerable, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to shed more light on these issues, the researchers drew on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/real-time+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;real-time data&lt;/a&gt; from TriNetX, a federated health research network, which contains &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from 68 health care organizations across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They scrutinized the anonymized records of adult patients who had and hadn't been prescribed gabapentin (26,414 in each group) for chronic low pain between 2004 and 2024, taking account of demographics, co-existing conditions, and the use of other analgesic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had received six or more gabapentin prescriptions were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and 85% more likely to be diagnosed with MCI within 10 years of their initial pain diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;And when the records were stratified by age, 18–64-year-olds prescribed the drug were more than twice as likely to develop either condition than those who hadn't been prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was no heightened risk among 18–34-year-olds prescribed the drug, the risks of dementia more than doubled and those of MCI more than tripled among 35–49-year-olds prescribed it. A similar pattern was observed among 50–64-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks also rose in tandem with prescription frequency: patients with 12 or more prescriptions were 40% more likely to develop dementia and 65% more likely to develop MCI than those prescribed gabapentin between three and 11 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/observational+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;observational study&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge that their study was retrospective, and they weren't able to account for dose or length of gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude, "Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years. Moreover, increased gabapentin prescription frequency correlated with dementia incidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They add, "Our results support the need for close monitoring of adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A 57-year-old woman spent six days in the hospital for severe liver damage after taking daily megadoses of the popular herbal supplement, turmeric, which she had seen touted on social media, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/liver-damage-turmeric-supplement-woman-hospitalized-rcna217578"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman, Katie Mohan, told the outlet that she had seen a doctor on Instagram suggesting it was useful against inflammation and joint pain. So, she began taking turmeric capsules at a dose of 2,250 mg per day. According to the World Health Organization, an acceptable daily dose is &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/638"&gt;up to 3 mg&lt;/a&gt; per kilogram of weight per day—for a 150-pound (68 kg) adult, that would be about 204 mg per day. Mohan was taking more than 10 times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, she developed stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, and dark urine. "I just did not feel well generally," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing a news report about the possibility of toxicity from turmeric, she connected her symptoms to the pills and went to urgent care. Blood tests revealed her liver enzyme levels were 60 times higher than the normal limit, suggesting liver damage. She was admitted to a local hospital and then transferred to NYU Langone in New York City. Her hepatologist there, Nikolaos Pyrsopoulos, said she was "one step before full liver damage, liver failure, requiring liver transplant."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rare toxicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, turmeric—a golden-colored staple of curries—is not harmful, particularly in foods. But, as herbal supplements have gained popularity and doses have gotten larger, doctors have reported &lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext"&gt;a rise in liver injuries from the spice&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, while rare overall, turmeric appears to have become the most common herbal cause of liver injuries in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a major source of frustration for the mother of two young children. Standing up can cause her to black out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e5cee" class="body-graf"&gt;“Things that I feel like I should be able to do cause pain pretty quickly, and then I kind of have to tap out,” said McCausland, 30, of West Valley City, Utah. “Getting down to play with my kids is really hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-264ab6"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-beach-se-126p-cf452b.jpg" alt="Aurora McCausland."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Aurora McCausland first noticed symptoms of lipedema as a teenager.

He performs a specialized type of liposuction that removes the diseased tissue to restore mobility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f7568" class="body-graf"&gt;The procedure isn’t cosmetic, and despite the buildup of fat, lipedema isn’t related to obesity. It’s not caused by overeating or inactivity. It’s a hormonally driven &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/inflammation-how-protect-body-against-chronic-disease-rcna193856" target="_blank"&gt;inflammatory condition&lt;/a&gt;, one that’s largely resistant to diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“It goes against the more traditional health dogma that’s out there about normal fat,” Smart said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e611a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Lipedema is almost exclusively seen in women, but scientists don’t have a good handle on how many are affected. &lt;a href="https://lipedema.net/how-prevalent-is-lipedema-in-women/" target="_blank"&gt;Some estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may affect up to 11% of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21ae88" class="body-graf"&gt;“There are no large-scale, population-based epidemiologic estimates. We don’t have blood tests. We don’t have imaging studies,” said Dr. Aaron Aday, co-director of vascular medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7c7ae8" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denied relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bae22" class="body-graf"&gt;Many women first notice symptoms of lipedema at puberty, and the disease often worsens during major hormonal shifts like pregnancy or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/non-hormonal-menopause-drugs-symptoms-insurance-hurdles-rcna152439" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-19305d" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland said her symptoms first appeared during her early teens: leg pain, swelling and bruising from the slightest touch. “I thought it was just growing pains,” she said. Fat built up around her ankles. No matter how physically active she was — dancing and CrossFit were two hobbies — she couldn’t make the fat in her lower legs go away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a72229" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, she was told it was just excess weight. “That if I worked out more, ate less, it would go away,” she said. “But no matter what I did, my legs just hurt more. I was doing everything right and getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-912ee4" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:Costofdenial@nbcuni.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8e9f4" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland’s five sisters experienced similar symptoms. She said none knew what the problem was until one of the sisters got liposuction to slim down her lower legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05cda9" class="body-graf"&gt;But lipedema fat isn’t the same as typical fat. Instead of feeling soft, it can feel like hard nodules under the skin. Regular liposuction can be risky to use on lipedema patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e569a" class="body-graf"&gt;It took far longer than it should have for her sister’s doctor to do the procedure, McCausland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-818153" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctor ended up giving her third-degree internal burns all on her legs, because he didn’t know that it wasn’t normal fat. He just kept going, having to go over and over and over trying to remove it,” she said. “It was just this horrible thing that happened. Obviously the doctor had no idea that she had this condition, and neither did my sister.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-244393" class="body-graf"&gt;Aday — who hasn’t treated McCausland — said that a specialized type of liposuction, performed by a surgeon with extensive knowledge of lipedema, is the most effective way to treat the disorder. It can reverse symptoms in many people. Some patients, he said, may have to have the procedure repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9dd69c" class="body-graf"&gt;The Roxbury Institute said that McCausland would need two liposuction surgeries, totaling more than $35,000. But her former insurance provider, Cigna Healthcare, denied coverage for the procedure twice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fece8f" class="body-graf"&gt;In an emailed statement, a Cigna representative said: “Lipedema is a painful condition that disproportionately impacts women, and we cover a range of treatment options, including liposuction, for patients that meet evidence-based clinical criteria. Ms. McCausland’s case was carefully reviewed by multiple doctors, including a plastic surgeon with expertise in lipedema. Based on the information submitted by her doctor, she did not meet the clinical criteria for liposuction at that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41d15e" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland believes her coverage was denied because she didn’t look sick enough, adding that she suspects the denial was based on her social media posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99f394" class="body-graf"&gt;They said “that it’s not medically necessary,” McCausland said. “That’s absurd. They’re not looking at how I live. They’re looking at a photo and deciding I don’t look bad enough to be helped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-648acd" class="body-graf"&gt;Cigna told NBC News that social media isn’t considered when it makes coverage decisions. “Our coverage decisions are based on the clinical information submitted by a patient’s treating physician in accordance with coverage policies and the patient’s plan design,” the representative said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffd6b5" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland’s health insurance has since switched to MotivHealth, because of her husband’s new job. McCausland said MotivHealth has already suggested to her in a phone call that it’s not a procedure it usually covers but that she can submit additional documentation. A representative for the company didn’t respond to several requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-0ab819" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A long under-recognized disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9028cd" class="body-graf"&gt;Lipedema is categorized in four stages, based on visual appearance. Stage 1 looks like minor fat accumulation and Stage 4 appears as severe leg disfigurement. Appearance, however, doesn’t always match the severity of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eb303" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can have a Stage 1 patient that has very severe and crippling symptoms of pain and swelling, and somebody who is maybe more progressed visibly that doesn’t have such severe symptoms,” Smart said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54aea0" class="body-graf"&gt;McCausland is a prime example. She doesn’t look sick, according to some commenters on her social media videos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6d7e14"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250710-aurora-mccausland-garden-se-126p-c38034.jpg" alt="Aurora McCausland."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;McCausland said her legs throb with pain, swell unpredictably and feel heavy, like they’re filled with cement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Aurora McCausland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a20a36" class="body-graf"&gt;“I’ve gotten a handful of people saying, ‘Well, I’ve looked at your other videos, and I agree with your insurance company,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c9791" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is very likely the reason why lipedema has been so under-recognized for such a long time,” Smart said. “So many people, so many insurance companies, so many physicians, have been telling lipedema patients for decades to just ‘work out, eat better, lose weight,’ when that’s not actually the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-68ef4f" class="body-graf"&gt;He said waiting until the condition progresses is dangerous. Without treatment, lipedema advances, causing more inflammation, worsening pain and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/knees-running-osteoarthritis-marathoners-orthopedic-rcna71270" target="_blank"&gt;permanent joint damage&lt;/a&gt;. The longer surgery is delayed, the harder it is to restore mobility in later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f28ea2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really unfortunate for Aurora, because at that early stage, it is less likely that she gets insurance coverage,” Smart said. “They’re not looking at the severity of her symptoms. They’re not looking at the severity of her pain, the decrease in mobility, her lack of ability to be able to perform those daily activities of living.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd97af" class="body-graf"&gt;Jonathan Kartt, chief executive officer of the Lipedema Foundation, said that the pain experienced by women with lipedema can be measured objectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9476e" class="body-graf"&gt;Using a tool to measure how patients perceive stimuli like temperature and touch, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11013692/" target="_blank"&gt;researchers in Germany found&lt;/a&gt; that women with lipedema had a lower pain threshold compared with other women.

But coupled with scientific advances – &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/26/lenacapavir-drug-trial-linda-gail-bekker-treating-hiv-aids-africa-women-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;such as twice-yearly drugs to prevent infection&lt;/a&gt; – the world had the “means and momentum” to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030, &lt;a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3#targets_and_indicators" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an internationally agreed goal&lt;/a&gt;, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, that has been “seriously jeopardised” in the early months of this year after sweeping US aid cuts that could undo decades of progress.

The reported number of people receiving preventive drugs in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; in November 2024 was approximately 43,000.

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive emotions make repeated learning more effective by strengthening consistent neural patterns.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Students remembered meaningless shapes better when they were paired with happy images compared to sad ones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;EEG scans revealed this “neural similarity” happens mainly in the brain’s right frontal region.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Negative emotions heightened brain activity but didn’t help memory, suggesting vigilance rather than learning benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HANGZHOU, China —&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists have discovered something remarkable about the human brain: positive emotions don’t just make us feel good, they actually help us remember things better by creating stronger neural connections during repeated learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/06/24/JNEUROSCI.0009-25.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that when people learn new information while experiencing positive emotions, their brains develop more consistent neural patterns across multiple learning sessions. This consistency directly translates to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/memory/"&gt;superior memory performance&lt;/a&gt; later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-scientists-tested-the-happy-learning-theory"&gt;How Scientists Tested the Happy Learning Theory&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Hangzhou Normal University and Nanjing Normal University in China conducted an experiment involving 44 &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;university students&lt;/a&gt; who learned meaningless squiggly shapes paired with emotional images. Each participant saw 144 different squiggles, with each one followed by either a positive image (like happy scenes), a neutral image, or a negative image (like sad or frightening scenes). Each squiggle-image pair was presented three times during the learning phase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a 24-hour break, participants took a recognition test to see how well they remembered the squiggles. People were significantly better at recognizing squiggles that had been paired with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;positive images&lt;/a&gt; compared to those paired with negative images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-scans-reveal-the-secret-behind-positive-learning"&gt;Brain Scans Reveal the Secret Behind Positive Learning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough came from monitoring participants’ &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; using electroencephalography (EEG) during both the learning and testing phases. When people learned squiggles paired with positive emotions, their brains showed remarkably similar neural firing patterns each time they encountered the same squiggle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/music-therapy-advanced-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how a familiar song&lt;/a&gt; triggers the same emotional response every time you hear it—except instead of music, your brain creates a consistent “neural rhythm” each time you encounter information. Positive emotions appear to help orchestrate this neural coordination, ensuring all brain regions stay synchronized across multiple learning sessions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This consistency was strongest in the right frontal region of the brain between 380 and 600 milliseconds after seeing each squiggle. Participants who showed the greatest neural similarity patterns in response to positive emotion-paired squiggles also scored highest on the memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;

While squiggles paired with negative images also showed increased neural similarity, this occurred in the brain’s right posterior region during a 280-600 millisecond time window and wasn’t linked to better memory performance. The researchers believe this reflects heightened alertness to potential threats rather than effective learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s methodology was particularly clever. Rather than showing emotional images before the squiggles, researchers showed the squiggles first, followed by the emotional images. This timing meant positive emotions couldn’t directly influence how people first processed each squiggle, but instead affected how their brains consolidated and strengthened those memories during subsequent learning sessions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research builds on growing evidence about how positive emotions broaden attention and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/calm-hope-relieve-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive processing&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike negative emotions, which tend to narrow focus to immediate threats, positive emotions create an optimal mental state for forming rich, detailed memories that include contextual information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For students &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/chewing-on-wood-brain-function-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;preparing for exams&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a positive emotional state during study sessions could lead to better retention. Teachers creating positive classroom environments might be more important for learning than previously understood. Rather than viewing emotions as a distraction from serious learning, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;positive feelings&lt;/a&gt; might be one of the most powerful tools for enhancing human memory and knowledge retention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This article summarizes peer-reviewed research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. While the findings highlight interesting connections between positive emotion and memory, they are based on controlled experiments with small, specific participant groups and may not directly apply to all learning situations. Always consult educational or mental health professionals for advice tailored to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling Stressed While Studying? Try These Science-Backed Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Take Three Deep Breaths&lt;/strong&gt; Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6. This activates your body’s relaxation response and helps shift your brain into a more receptive state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Find Something Good&lt;/strong&gt; Before opening your books, spend 30 seconds thinking about something you’re grateful for or excited about. This primes your brain for positive processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Create Pleasant Associations&lt;/strong&gt; Study in a comfortable spot with good lighting. Play soft instrumental music or diffuse a calming scent. Your brain will start linking these positive cues with learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Celebrate Small Wins&lt;/strong&gt; After completing each study section, acknowledge your progress. Say “I did that well” or give yourself a mental high-five. This reinforces the positive emotional connection to learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Take Refreshing Breaks&lt;/strong&gt; Every 25-30 minutes, step away for 5 minutes. Do something that makes you smile—watch a funny video, text a friend, or step outside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Reframe Challenges&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of “This is too hard,” try “I’m building my brain.” Replace “I’m bad at this” with “I’m learning this.” Your emotional response to difficulty affects how well you remember.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. End on a High Note&lt;/strong&gt; Finish each study session by reviewing something you understood well. This leaves your brain with a positive final impression of the material.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember:&lt;/strong&gt; Your emotional state while learning is just as important as the time you spend studying. A relaxed, positive mindset helps your brain form stronger, more lasting memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted an experiment with 44 right-handed university students (average age 20.8 years, 27 females) from Hangzhou Normal University. Participants learned 144 meaningless squiggle shapes, each paired with emotional images from standardized databases. The squiggles were divided into three groups: those paired with positive, neutral, or negative images. Each squiggle-image pair was presented three times during the learning phase, with participants asked to determine whether each squiggle was “knotted” to ensure they paid attention. After a 24-hour delay, participants completed a recognition test for the squiggles while their brain activity was monitored using EEG.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants showed significantly better recognition memory for squiggles paired with positive images compared to negative images. Brain activity analysis revealed that squiggles paired with positive emotions showed greater neural pattern similarity across the three learning repetitions in the right frontal brain region. During the recognition test, only squiggles from the positive condition showed significant ERP old/new effects in the parietal brain region between 400-1200ms, indicating stronger memory retrieval processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study had several limitations including a relatively small sample size of 44 participants, all of whom were young university students, limiting applicability to other populations. The researchers used artificial, meaningless squiggles rather than real educational content, and the study was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting rather than real-world learning environments. Seven participants were excluded from some analyses due to insufficient artifact-free trials.&lt;/p&gt;
