            Raw cheese made with milk from dairy cattle infected with bird flu can harbor infectious virus for months and may be a risk to public health, according to a new study from researchers at Cornell University that was funded by the US Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000j2e6bap9lbrwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raw milk cheeses are those made with milk that hasn’t been heat-treated, or pasteurized, to kill germs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000k2e6b7iyiwzwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although federal law prohibits the sale of raw milk across state lines, sales of raw milk cheese are legal nationwide as long as it’s aged at least 60 days before landing on store shelves. This requirement, which has been in place since 1949, is thought to cut the risk of contamination, since it allows development of natural acids and enzymes, which were believed to kill off pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000l2e6br53sknd0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study shows that this aging process may not inactivate the H5N1 virus, however, and it underscores the risk of consuming raw or undercooked foods during the bird flu outbreak, which continues to infect dairy cattle, poultry and a growing number of other animal species.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000m2e6bvy1g3py9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The same group of researchers previously found that H5N1 virus remained infectious in refrigerated raw milk for up to eight weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000n2e6b92yvm61q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Diego Diel, who led the study, says he thinks the virus may be so stable in milk and cheese because it’s protected by the complex matrix of molecules around it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000o2e6bi0zn9p46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The protein and fat content in the cheese and milk provide a good environment for the virus to survive at refrigeration temperature,” said Diel, an associate professor of virology at Cornell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000p2e6bc33z24f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, has said food doesn’t pose a bird flu risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000q2e6ba2tf7i4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The disease is not passed through food, so you cannot get it – as far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or milk or meat from an infected animal,” Kennedy told Fox News in an interview that aired Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000r2e6bi221cmn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s only partly true. Cats and other animals have been infected by raw cow’s milk and raw pet food, and there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;three confirmed human infections&lt;/a&gt; in which investigators were unable to determine the source of the person’s exposure to the H5N1 virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89ai78u001w2e6bcz3khi8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been no confirmed reports of people getting sick from eating or drinking bird-flu contaminated foods, including raw milk cheese, but dairy workers have been infected by getting splashed with raw milk in their faces or eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000t2e6blud14bzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s still not entirely clear whether humans can be infected by eating or drinking contaminated food, Diel said, noting that his study wasn’t really designed to answer that question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000u2e6bi9c830a3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I do think it is possible. There is a risk of infection,” he said. “It obviously depends on the dose, how much of that contaminated product is ingested.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000w2e6bc913s4r5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may also depend on the strain of virus in the milk or cheese. Diel and his team tested the stability of the B3.13 virus, which originally infected cattle in the US in March 2024. B3.13 has caused only mild disease in people. However, a new strain, D1.1, which has been associated with some severe human cases, has also crossed into cattle, further increasing the risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000x2e6box7wrn0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the study, the researchers made mini cheeses with milk they spiked with H5N1 virus. They made these cheeses at three pH levels: 6.6, 5.8 and the most acidic formula, 5.0.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89bm2oz00033b6m2gedax3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then tested the cheeses over time to see whether any virus capable of infecting cells remained. They injected samples into fertilized chicken eggs, considered the gold standard test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000y2e6bc6dx771i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of the virus remained high for the first seven days after the cheese was made and then dropped a bit in the cheeses produced at pH levels 6.6 and 5.8. But importantly, the virus remained infectious for the full two-month aging period, showing that it was remarkably stable in the cheese over a long period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja000z2e6b3yarcva9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those results were confirmed by some real-world examples. The researchers tested samples of raw milk cheese from a farm that had inadvertently produced them with milk from cows infected with bird flu. These findings also showed that levels of virus stayed high and remained infectious over the full two months of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00102e6buwstdlfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our study demonstrates that HPAI H5N1 virus exhibits remarkable stability throughout the cheese making process,” the authors wrote in their &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.643009v1.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, posted ahead of peer review Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899og6k001e2e6bte2l62lq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the study suggested that making raw milk cheese more acidic may kill the virus and make the cheese safer to eat. No live virus was detected in the cheese produced at the lowest pH, 5.0. Prior studies have also shown that common pasteurization methods inactivate the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00112e6b26esg4cd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said the new study was consistent with tests of the stability of the virus in milk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00122e6b2u8vr23i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have also observed that milk can change the pH needed to inactivate the virus,” said Dr. Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University, who has been studying the transmission of H5N1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00132e6bcu3mdlor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We and others have repeatedly observed that milk will prevent the degradation of the virus on surfaces, and it increases the pH stability, such that a much lower pH than normal is needed to inactivate the virus,” said Lakdawala, who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00142e6bjigre058@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA posted the findings of the study Friday along with preliminary results from its own ongoing sampling study of raw cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00152e6bawarb8zo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA sampling study, which was announced in December, has tested 110 cheese samples taken from store shelves across the country. So far, 96 of those samples were negative by polymerase chain reaction testing, or PCR, which detects live virus as well as inactive viral particles, indicating that those cheeses probably weren’t made with contaminated milk. The results from the remaining 14 samples are pending, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00162e6bpknhlkb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA is continuing to work with Federal and state partners to address the ongoing outbreak of HPAI A (H5N1) in dairy cattle.  The FDA has sampled a total of 464 pasteurized dairy products, including milk cheese butter and ice cream, all were negative for viable H5N1.  In addition, multiple research studies have confirmed that pasteurization inactivates the virus,” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle" target="_blank"&gt;the statement&lt;/a&gt; said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm89anxin001z2e6brk1j3mkr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, experts say the study is a good reminder of the importance of surveillance – and of not consuming raw milk products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm899e8ja00172e6bb75aqn9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is another reason we should push to ensure there is no bird flu in milk products and only consume pasteurized dairy products,” Lakdawala said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

High blood levels of molecules called acylcarnitines, markers of aging metabolism, were linked to faster cognitive decline and greater Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, lifestyle choices like plant-based diets and regular exercise can effectively lower these molecules, reducing bioenergetic age and potentially delaying Alzheimer’s onset. This bioenergetic approach could help identify individuals at risk earlier and provide personalized strategies to maintain brain health without relying solely on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bioenergetic Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; High acylcarnitine levels indicate an older bioenergetic age, significantly linked to Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy living, including diet and exercise, can lower bioenergetic age, potentially offering protective benefits similar to Alzheimer’s medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; About 30% of study participants with genetic risks but favorable bioenergetic profiles may especially benefit from lifestyle interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person’s “bioenergetic age”—or how youthfully their cells generate energy—might be a key indicator of whether they’re at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, new research from Weill Cornell Medicine shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Feb. 24 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, suggests healthy living can turn back the bioenergetic clock for some people, helping them fend off Alzheimer’s as effectively as a new drug called lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108144"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman, a clock and fresh foods." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/bioenergetic-age-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The benefit is on par with the Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s quite big because it means some people can lower their risk without the uncertain side effects of current treatments,” said senior author Dr. Jan Krumsiek, associate professor of physiology and biophysics and computational genomics in the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. The study’s first author, Dr. Matthias Arnold, is head of the computational neurobiology team at Helmholtz Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings bring us a step closer to solving a long-standing puzzle. One of the early warning signs of Alzheimer’s is that brain cells start losing their ability to produce and use energy efficiently, such as metabolizing glucose (sugar). But some people don’t show disease symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This delay between abnormalities in energy pathways and the onset of symptomatic disease suggests there is a “bioenergetic capacity” that provides a buffer for these individuals. Their bodies and brains are better at keeping energy levels up even when problems start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these cases, people can be unusually healthy when we look at their cognition,” said Dr. Krumsiek, who is also a member of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine. “They make it to old age without the kind of declines that usually creep in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could the researchers identify individuals with this beneficial higher bioenergetic capacity and help those without it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Tool to Predict Risk of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krumsiek and his colleagues turned to a group of molecules called acylcarnitines, which are associated with declining cognition and breaking down or metabolizing fats and proteins for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test if high acylcarnitine levels in the blood could predict who’s at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, the researchers used data from a large-scale study called the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating,” Dr. Krumsiek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dividing research participants into groups based on their specific acylcarnitine levels highlighted people with more severe Alzheimer’s disease and others with fewer symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led the researchers to define a bioenergetic clock based on acylcarnitines—how old a person’s metabolism acts, compared to actual age. Higher bioenergetic age is linked to higher acylcarnitine levels, worsened Alzheimer’s pathology, cognitive decline and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also quantified cognitive decline using a common test called the mini-mental state examination, on which a score below 24 out of 30 points indicates impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that people with low acylcarnitine levels to begin with declined more slowly, losing about 0.5 points less per year than people with high acylcarnitine levels. The benefit is on par with the Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some degree, a person’s bioenergetic clock ticks forward at a rate determined by their genetics, but having a healthy lifestyle—for example, eating a plant-based diet and exercising —can help keep acylcarnitine levels low, which means a younger bioenergetic age, Dr. Krumsiek explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They went on to identify a subgroup of participants, about 30% of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with older bioenergetic age but favorable genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals may benefit more from early lifestyle interventions designed to decrease their bioenergetic age and potentially delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Dr. Krumsiek hopes to home in on the lifestyle interventions most effective for lowering bioenergetic age. For example, eating a low-carb diet may help maintain metabolic health, but just how low would carbohydrate consumption have to be for a person to see benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also points to an inexpensive, rapid test that could determine a person’s acylcarnitine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fortunate that these blood tests—originally developed to identify metabolic and mitochondrial disorders in newborns—can also help assess a person’s bioenergetic age,” Dr. Krumsiek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can repurpose this technology for older adults, that could provide a way to start personalized treatment earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this bioenergetic age and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7113100145414145311c14155f121e031f141d1d5f141504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Prempeh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Barbara Prempeh – Weill Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57032-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Jan Krumsiek et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a systemic “bioenergetic capacity”, the individual ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker presentations of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be achieved using existing clinical assays.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:44:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5jcEJueTBrSDdiX2h3d2Y5NlcxZEJKMTBEQjJVZzU5QnplTm9ndU9WQm92NjIyTG00YkNEU0oyNDJkLTlmYmtxR3NpaEhpZUNobDhCcE9VYjVqcDB3TnVORmUtVXctVGo4aUVBOEllVE0</guid></item><item><title>US measles cases reach 5-year high; 15 states report cases, Texas outbreak grows - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNeTA1X29qdV83SWt6UUdZNW44OUI0NFBNa1FqZ0RWaExSUmU0R2lCOG1oUlVfbUhvWnNoTlh6cm5nOTl2bmdHZU1tMjZhNWE0Z2FSVTFSSzROVDRUM3d0dXY3MkxLcTdWc3BYOUc1N0I5WVZBS0tXU3VIbmppZVpiN3JPM3FfellwdFduMjRMbWdSTFNZVDBMbkN6amVYbzQ0ZWJYSTYzZ28zNzdtRjBPbTl2UUlGOHkwVUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;The US has now recorded over 300 measles cases just three months into 2025, exceeding the yearly case counts for all years after 2019. The bulk of this year's cases are from an outbreak that erupted in an undervaccinated county in West Texas in late January, which has since spread to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-spills-into-third-state-as-cases-reach-258/"&gt;New Mexico and Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the afternoon of March 14, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas reports 259 cases&lt;/a&gt; across 11 counties, 34 hospitalizations, and one death, which occurred in an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl. &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico reports 35 cases&lt;/a&gt; across two counties, two hospitalizations, and one death. That death occurred in an unvaccinated adult who did not seek medical treatment and tested positive for the virus posthumously. The cause of death is still under investigation. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Oklahoma reports two probable cases&lt;/a&gt; linked to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, 12 other states have reported at least one confirmed measles case since the start of the year: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this year has seen three measles outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 13, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;301 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, which do not include 36 new cases reported today in Texas and two in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Measles is back”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, when health officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;victoriously declared measles eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; thanks to concerted vaccination campaigns, only three other years have had higher tallies of measles cases. In 2014, the country saw 667 measles cases. In 2018, there were 381 cases. And in 2019—&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/were-embarrassed-us-health-experts-chagrined-by-measles-resurgence/"&gt;when the country was on the verge of losing its elimination status&lt;/a&gt;—there was a startling 1,274 cases, largely driven by massive outbreaks in New York. Measles is considered eliminated if there is no continuous spread in the country over the course of at least 12 months. (This is not to be confused with "eradication," which is defined as "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm"&gt;permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence&lt;/a&gt;" of an infectious disease. Smallpox and rinderpest are the only pathogens humans have eradicated.)&lt;/p&gt;

In preclinical mouse models, terpenes such as geraniol and linalool significantly reduced chronic pain, providing promising alternatives to opioid medications and avoiding THC’s psychoactive side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terpenes appear to act through the adenosine A2a receptor, indicating a potential sedative mechanism. These findings open the door to developing novel, non-opioid therapeutic options for chronic and post-operative pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Terpenes:&lt;/strong&gt; Geraniol and linalool were the most effective terpenes in relieving fibromyalgia and post-surgical pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opioid Alternative:&lt;/strong&gt; Terpenes could provide safer alternatives to opioids without psychoactive side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism of Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Terpenes relieve pain by targeting the adenosine A2a receptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terpenes from the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant may be a viable medication for fibromyalgia and post-surgical pain relief, according to University of Arizona Health Sciences research published in &lt;em&gt;Pharmacological Reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper builds on previous research led by Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction member John Streicher, PhD, that showed the pain-relieving properties of terpenes in models of inflammation and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108140"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and leaves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/cannabis-fibromyalgia-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Terpenes, the compounds that give plants their aroma and taste, offer an alternative path to pain relief without the unwanted psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is showing that terpenes are not a good option for reducing acute pain resulting from an injury, such as stubbing your toe or touching a hot stove; however, we are seeing significant reductions in pain when terpenes are used for chronic or pathological pain,” said Streicher, who is a professor in the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson’s Department of Pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was the first to investigate the impact of terpenes in preclinical models of fibromyalgia and post-operative pain and expand the scope of potential pain-relieving treatments using terpenes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpenes, the compounds that give plants their aroma and taste, offer an alternative path to pain relief without the unwanted psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher and the research team tested four terpenes found in moderate to high levels in &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;: geraniol, linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that each of the terpenes resulted in high levels of pain relief in mouse models of post-operative pain and fibromyalgia. Geraniol provided the most significant level of pain relief, followed by linalool, beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With fibromyalgia, there isn’t much understanding of what the pain state is, and there are not a lot of great options for treating it,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that terpenes may be a viable treatment option for fibromyalgia pain, which could potentially have a large impact and make a difference for an under-treated population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder that affects up to 5% of the world’s population, according to research published in Healthcare (Basel) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health estimates about 4 million U.S. adults have fibromyalgia, which affects women more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-surgical pain straddles the line between acute pain and chronic pain. It is usually short in duration, but it also involves physiological changes such as increased inflammation and sensitization of the body’s pain system that contribute to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Opioids do a good job controlling post-surgical pain, but they can cause constipation that can increase the chances of post-surgical complications such as adhesions,” Streicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are always looking for better options, and this study suggests that terpenes could be a novel therapeutic for post-operative pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, approximately 310 million major surgeries are performed each year, according to 2020 research published in the International Journal of Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research that is being done by Dr. Streicher’s lab on terpenes and their potential to help those who suffer from chronic pain demonstrates the importance of basic research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are hundreds of unique chemicals that plants make, including the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis&lt;/em&gt; plant, that are undiscovered,” said Todd Vanderah, PhD, director of the Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction at the U of A Health Sciences and professor and head of the Department of Pharmacology at the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Nature is incredible at making unique chemical structures, and many of these chemicals are unknowns when it comes to their abilities to aid in human health, diseases and disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A great current example is medication semaglutide, sold under the brand name Ozempic, which has a chemical structure that was isolated not from a plant, but from an animal that is prevalent in the Southwest, the Gila monster. These discoveries from natural products through research such as Dr. Streicher’s can result in very useful medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also demonstrated that the mechanism of action of terpenes on post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain was the same as in previous studies. Its action through the adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor – a receptor that caffeine targets and blocks – suggests a sedative effect that could be the subject of future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streicher’s co-authors were Caleb Seekins, who worked in Streicher’s lab as an undergraduate biochemistry student and is now pursuing a medical degree at the College of Medicine – Tucson; Alyssa Welborn, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2024; and Abigail Schwarz, who finished her doctorate in Streicher’s lab in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health under award no.

Our lab found that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene relieve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy via Adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests terpenes as potential non-opioid, non-cannabinoid therapeutics. In this study, we investigated post-operative and fibromyalgia pain, expanding potential terpene applications to different pain types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female CD-1 mice had their baseline mechanical sensitivity measured via von Frey filaments and underwent either paw incision surgery or reserpine-induced fibromyalgia (0.32 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;sc&lt;/em&gt;). After pain was established, the mice received 200 mg/kg &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt; of a terpene, and their mechanical sensitivity was measured over three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the potential mechanism of action, mice were given the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist istradefylline (3.2 mg/kg, &lt;em&gt;ip&lt;/em&gt;) 10 min before terpene, with mechanical sensitivity measured after. Hot plate pain testing was performed as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terpene treatment caused time-dependent elevation of the mechanical thresholds of the mice from both pain models, strongest for geraniol, then linalool or α-humulene, indicating that these four terpenes are anti-nociceptive in post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretreatment with istradefylline blocked antinociception, suggesting the terpenes act via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R in these pain models. Terpenes had no effect on hot plate latencies, ruling out non-specific motor effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that the terpenes geraniol, linalool, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene may be a viable medication for post-operative and fibromyalgia pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mechanism of action via the A&lt;sub&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt;R furthers our knowledge of its importance in pain processing and as a target of terpene drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 21:20:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1fYnh2RG1XR29lSlpnenhBQ0I2a245Y1lkRjdhOUM3ZjRMSVJsYl9GWFZvak5XWVJtNnpGcGdJem5lSEM2ekdSRXg4RjJzWEM2YUZOUGpTVFRXZDc4b3prRHo5emRYS1AyYVh4emFoY19aVGJGbWlEajU0WQ</guid></item><item><title>Dr. Oz says probiotic supplements have wide-ranging health benefits.

The unit houses older, medically dependent men in four-bed pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other inmates in two sections of the same unit have tested negative at this point, but the unit is still being kept under quarantine and those in the two sections are being treated. The department said restrictions on visits and volunteer services to the unit are expected to be lifted by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is being provided following guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which includes washing clothing and bedding in a disinfectant. The health department is also providing education about hygiene and preventing the spread of scabies to inmates and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scabies is an infestation from a mite that burrows into the upper level of a person's skin and lays eggs. It is typically spread by prolonged skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the health department said there has been ongoing issues with a skin rash, possibly caused by laundry soap, in multiple units at the prison that is not contagious. The rash makes it difficult to identify scabies cases without testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNQlFuT2F0T0JkLTlETS1PcFU0VmVHUFp5QmNyd3pabDZ0SFo3bzNfTXBKc2gySmhDdlB5QXg4czZsTThOVjBHaXpueWVlYTZvWDFvLV9YVnR4RG5xcExYX0VZY1J2bmZpYjUxeHZ4bWpEa2ZIQzRLR0pFUVlxSHBBMTdQeEE1RnVfeWV4eGM0MTVzZnhfaWhmMjdEVzhIblFyLU4tQmtlalJxRC14Qy15ZTBYOA</guid></item><item><title>Oakland County sees Michigan's first measles case of 2025 - Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxQSWxpczBkckhPNlB4eW9ReWxrakd6SEtabkg0TTFBV2JqUlM2WkJlOHEyS1dOUmdQQzNxcGdoS0pTczdQNkh5M0pzclQ3UzBCQWNYOFhvcC1IcGdxdGdXQTlzZHAweThpOG1mdXBvaXc3RGhPSC1WM1k2blU1ODlMWHctcnpaUlh0bi1PTEh0SjZwWEVldEt2dkRUcjktYjFvV1BfbWJ4MXhtTHJ1UVBoVF9kUzFSUk1uQkFRQUwwb3Fya3RxOUxqOVNvT09BcEt4X01ZZGpDWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Oakland County confirmed Michigan's first measles case of 2025 on Friday, county executive spokesman Bill Mullan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The case is associated with recent international travel and there are possible exposures, Mullan said.

Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso help populate your gut with healthy bacteria, and thanks to the gut-brain connection, they can bolster your mood by rebalancing the good and bad bacteria. “If bad bacteria in the digestive system become overwhelming, that can cause problems in the gut and mental health problems,” says David Mischoulon, a psychiatrist and director of the depression program at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Interestingly, a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25998000/" target="_blank"&gt;study from the College of William and Mary&lt;/a&gt;

They’re calm, easier to train than some dogs, and able to work up to seven or eight years (they live eight to 10 years in captivity). Their body alone is generally longer than a 13-inch MacBook Air—and their tail is equally as long, if not longer. (A New York City rat is only about 16 inches, nose to tail.) A giant pouched rat’s sense of smell is so strong that they could conceivably detect half a drop of chlorine in a space the size of 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools, says APOPO’s head of training Cindy Fast, a behavioral neuroscientist who coaches the rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And while rats may be much-maligned in society, Carolina and her peers in East Africa have raised detection rates for TB—the leading cause of death worldwide by infectious disease—by &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apopo.org/what-we-do/detecting-tuberculosis/where-we-work/apopo-in-tanzania" target="_blank"&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; at local clinics, where patient samples undergo a smear test under a microscope that is, according to Agizew, usually only 20 to 40 percent accurate.

They also say they are unsure of that person's vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the patient returned home on February 27, first experienced symptoms on March 7, and the rash emerged on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the period of possible transmission is from March 3 to March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say they have identified two places where the public may have been exposed. They are the Emergency Room at Henry Ford Rochester on University Drive on both March 8 and March 10. The second location is the Kruse and Muir restaurant on Main in Rochester from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say the measles virus stays active in the air for 2 hours after an infectious person leaves. Early symptoms you should be on the lookout for include fever, runny nose, and pink eye. If you are experiencing any of those symptoms, you should not seek treatment without calling the provider first so they can take appropriate precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related Video: Can adults get a measles shot if they don't know their childhood vaccine status?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

Vaccinations are our best protection against infectious diseases like measles, and we urge anyone who hasn’t been vaccinated to do so as soon as possible. We also encourage anyone with questions about their vaccination status to reach out to their healthcare provider or the health department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kathy Hochul to temporarily shut down markets in the New York City metro area to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the wet markets reopened in mid-February, inspectors have found the virus in birds at &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seven more&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s roughly 70 wet markets, which remain open and serve thousands of customers weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture, which performs quarterly unannounced inspections and bird flu testing at the markets, said it may order another shutdown if clear evidence persists that bird flu is spreading in the live poultry business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have highlighted the city’s wet markets as environments where viruses spreading between animal species can mutate and potentially become more transmittable to humans. While there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html?cove-tab=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;70 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu spreading to humans nationwide since 2024 – including one fatality – none have been in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Jose Fernandez at La Granja market in West Harlem earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, New York City’s wet markets continue to sell thousands of birds a month, according to state data from 2023. One estimate from 2021 put the total at roughly 1 million live birds per month. Several customers interviewed for this story said they prefer the fresher, higher-quality meat from these markets, while others count on them for halal or other specific slaughter practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="streamfield-embed streamfield-embed-default streamfield-paragraph mb-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘The meat tastes completely different&lt;/b&gt;’&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Granja Live Poultry, an unassuming corner storefront in West Harlem next to an artisanal coffee roaster selling $7 espresso tonics, is quiet from the outside. But inside, cages packed with squawking chickens as well as turkeys, quails and even rabbits line the walls from floor to ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend an hour there and you’ll hear a half-dozen languages, including Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic and Bengali. Owner Jose Fernandez, who has run the store since 1999, said he gets just about every type of customer you can imagine – except one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have too many customers that are white people, because they don’t cook too much,” Fernandez said, laughing. “They eat in the restaurant, so their life is very different. In my house we cook every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;A price list at La Granja market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez, originally from the Dominican Republic, said his customers are mostly like him: people with roots in other countries who are used to eating chickens raised outside on a diet of corn, grass, and insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The meat tastes completely different from the meat you can buy at the supermarket or butcher,” Fernandez said in Spanish. “People who come here know the difference, the taste of real chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many of his customers follow halal or other dietary laws, Fernandez said, which require specific slaughter methods he can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said he sells about 4,000 chickens a week, he said, along with small numbers of game birds and rabbits. The corkboard walls of his tiny office at the front of the store are covered with supplier invoices and the business cards of various officials at the federal and state Departments of Agriculture. He said his store underwent regular unannounced inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the shop floor, staff regularly sweep and hose down the tile. Behind a counter in the back, birds are plucked and processed in about eight minutes, returning whole or in pieces, encased in plastic and resembling the chicken sold at the Whole Foods a few blocks east (though considerably cheaper at $3.20 per pound versus $4.49 per pound advertised at the Whole Foods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Customers examine the live birds at La Granja earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tania Cardenas, originally from Ecuador, recently picked up two chickens at La Granja – “The Farm,” in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re better this way,” Cardenas said in Spanish. “For my health, I prefer fresh. When they’re slaughtered here and I can see the blood drain, I know I’m eating something fresh that won’t make me sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the risks of shopping at wet markets outweigh any benefits. While properly cooked eggs and meat are safe to eat, a wide body of literature has identified such markets as high-risk sites for transmitting disease from animals to humans – most notably as &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2025-03-11/what-caused-covid-19-what-we-know-5-years-later" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a potential origin&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live poultry markets create ideal conditions for this “zoonotic” transmission, according to Ann Linder, associate director of policy and research at Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Program and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Animal-Markets-and-Zoonotic-Disease-Risk-high-resolution.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; that examined disease transmission at wet markets in 15 countries, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birds from multiple farms are mixed together, increasing the risk that one may carry a pathogen, she said. Because they are packed into tight quarters, often in stressful conditions that weaken their immune systems, they become more vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the ongoing bird flu outbreak, which started in 2022 and picked up sharply again this year, is largely concentrated in major “factory farm” producers in the Midwest, that doesn’t guarantee that the city’s wet markets are safe, Linder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image-with-caption mb-7"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="mt-1"&gt;&lt;p class="image-with-caption-description"&gt;Owner Jose Fernandez says most of his customers shop at La Granja because they prefer the taste of fresh chicken, or they have dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="flexible-link null image-with-caption-credit-link image-with-caption-credit-link" rel="noopener"&gt;Ryan Kailath / Gothamist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a constant influx of new birds and new potential pathogens,” Linder said, referring to the fact that birds are sourced from multiple farms. She said wet markets are especially risky because customers examine the birds up close and the animals are slaughtered on site, potentially creating more avenues for transmission. Additionally, she said that because wet markets often operate in dense, residential neighborhoods in New York City, an outbreak that starts here could be especially hard to contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with more bird flu detections at the city’s wet markets since their reopening than before the initial shutdown, activists, city councilmembers, and even Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa are questioning why they remain open. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to bird flu, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States there have been 70 cases of bird flu detected in humans since the current outbreak began spiking again in 2024, with one fatality reported in Louisiana in January. For now, the disease does not appear to spread easily from animals to humans, but public health experts expressed concern that it will mutate to become more easily transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I literally don’t think there’s anything any market could do to actually be shut down,” said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights organization New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birnkrant has been documenting conditions at some of the city’s wet markets for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s blood, feces, body parts, overcrowded birds,” Birnkrant said of a store in Queens that she visited on Tuesday. “Many we found with open wounds because the birds are cannibalizing each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantal Fernandez, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Health, said that while her agency provides guidance to workers on proper protective equipment and handling dead birds, they don’t have a specific program to educate consumers about the risks these markets pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarra Jagne, a professor of public and ecosystem health at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine who has studied Northeast U.S. bird markets extensively, said that strict regulations introduced in 2003 made the markets much safer, such as one mandating that different species be caged separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent cases of bird flu in markets are to be expected given the ongoing national outbreak, she said, but do not highlight an inherent problem with the markets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been to many, many of these markets, and the change from before is just enormous,” Jarra said, referring to the period before the 2003 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at La Granja, Fernandez said the state’s monitoring and detection program is sufficient for him and his customers to feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand surged after the weeklong shutdown before business normalized and then slowed a little, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not sure why. It could be the economy, he said. But most likely it’s the usual seasonal pattern – his customers often give up meat for Lent and Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUzVLaU05UTdxLW1YdHNrbHVUX0l2TEtOTkxuNXNIRExtQVBqUUpqNUpkelZvSVZnbXNWc28wQVhrM3FyYkFwT0VxeEt0eng2RzlWSVc5VERrWDZJd1pCSFNncFVlWEY3aTRVUllpclhJZVRucVNTcHZ0QXZkRWFnS1BKcjRtbm80ZHo4Ti04Nmc5T1JvYkZ4eUpjako2dWc</guid></item><item><title>Top nutrition expert shares the No. 1 mistake he sees in American diets - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVlHTTJScjRrOTBRcEVWa1Jlb202OUJtSmFRVWFmUXNFdFZiYm1BVkh6TXVTaEd1UGlQOThTbHhtVm1FenlpQlFMd1luSGxFU0FqcUpvcTlUSVA3YllzZGVXNko0RDJ6TEtHTGtMaUhSX0IxNk10MU5KYlRiUkpfODZZTnhDYzVBSzJQSzhkeEZrMzN1UXVSTjZ5T0c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-fac7c12f-7 ifTevn"&gt;&lt;img alt="photo of Tim Spector." data-content-placement="primary_image" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="impression-element" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=75 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=75 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=75 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=75 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=75 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=75 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=75 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1787758953-e1741961998119.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;p data-cy="caption" class="sc-13b6974d-9 dKtuAn"&gt;“We’re often failing in nutrition to think about…what does your plate look like,” gut health expert and epidemiologist Tim Spector says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-cy="credit" class="sc-13b6974d-10 hbPqHz"&gt;Mike Marsland—Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVlHTTJScjRrOTBRcEVWa1Jlb202OUJtSmFRVWFmUXNFdFZiYm1BVkh6TXVTaEd1UGlQOThTbHhtVm1FenlpQlFMd1luSGxFU0FqcUpvcTlUSVA3YllzZGVXNko0RDJ6TEtHTGtMaUhSX0IxNk10MU5KYlRiUkpfODZZTnhDYzVBSzJQSzhkeEZrMzN1UXVSTjZ5T0c</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Finally Solve the Case of Egypt’s ‘Pregnant Mummy’—And It’s Not What We Expected - Indian Defence Review</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNM2NLdmJXbTBRaHVmZTY0RGIwbktpQmFuVldvS1cyNzA5ajBZMzFPTzU0TThyZGVVbzM0ZGl0VmJUMjc1LUk3TERidGpfTlNRb0ZTc0JqZFpOemhLdnh0bWdEV1h0UXBoWm9MSTR4UUxkRFZHUTZ3R0FDWTRtNmhGWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study has put an end to a four-year-long scientific debate regarding the “Mysterious Lady,” an ancient Egyptian mummy originally thought to be pregnant and suffering from cancer. First discovered in Luxor and housed in Poland since 1826, this mummy was long misidentified as a male priest until a 2021 analysis suggested it was a young woman carrying a fetus. The same study also raised suspicions of nasopharyngeal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, a new examination by an international team of 14 researchers has debunked both claims, revealing that what was believed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process, and that there is no concrete evidence of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440321001746" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this latest analysis meticulously reexamined over 1,300 CT scan images of the mummy, offering a far more precise understanding of its condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mistaken Pregnancy: Embalming Materials, Not a Fetus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, researchers from the Warsaw Mummy Project made a groundbreaking claim: the mummy of the &lt;strong&gt;Mysterious Lady &lt;/strong&gt;contained a fetus between 6.5 and 7.5 months old. They based this assertion on CT scans that showed a cluster of materials inside the woman’s abdomen. Unable to find distinct fetal bones, they hypothesized that the acidity of the mother’s womb had dissolved the skeleton, essentially “pickling” the fetus over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This claim was controversial from the start. Several specialists expressed skepticism, questioning whether it was even possible for fetal bones to degrade under such conditions. The new study firmly refutes the earlier interpretation, showing that the abdominal mass was nothing more than embalming materials. In response to the initial claims, radiologist and mummy expert&lt;strong&gt; Sahar Saleem &lt;/strong&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Live Science&lt;/em&gt; in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to “identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further disprove the original hypothesis, the new team emphasized a key fact: while acidity can dissolve bones under certain conditions, embalming fluid would have neutralized the necessary chemical processes, making it scientifically implausible for the fetus to simply vanish. The supposed fetal remains turned out to be four separate bundles of embalming materials, likely placed inside the mummy’s abdomen as part of the preservation process, a common ancient &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/archaeologists-suggests-ancient-egyptians-built-pyramids-with-an-ancient-high-tech-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="74443"&gt;Egyptian funerary practice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kownacki)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;No Evidence of Cancer: Skull Damage Explained&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside the pregnancy claim, the 2021 study also suggested that the Mysterious Lady suffered from &lt;strong&gt;nasopharyngeal cancer&lt;/strong&gt;, based on irregularities in her skull. This was another startling revelation, as it would have been one of the earliest known cases of cancer identified in an Egyptian mummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, the latest research shows that these skull deformations were most likely caused by the embalming process itself, rather than disease. The removal of &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/researchers-have-deciphered-the-death-wave-in-the-brain/" data-type="post" data-id="70741"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;, a standard part of mummification, often involved breaking through the skull to extract soft tissue. This process could easily account for the structural damage seen in the CT scans. None of the 14 experts involved in the latest study could find clear signs of cancerous growth, leading them to conclude that the previous interpretation was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This misdiagnosis highlights a wider challenge in mummy studies—distinguishing between post-mortem damage, embalming artifacts, and actual disease. While cancer has been identified in other mummies, scientists must be cautious in making such determinations, especially when relying solely on imaging rather than direct tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Importance of Reevaluating Mummy Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resolution of this debate is more than just a correction of scientific misunderstanding. It serves as a cautionary tale about the challenges of interpreting ancient remains. Mummified bodies undergo significant post-mortem changes due to embalming, environmental conditions, and centuries of decay. As a result, distinguishing biological realities from preservation techniques requires extremely detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The intense public interest in the “pregnant mummy” case underscores how sensational claims can spread quickly, even before they are fully confirmed. The Warsaw Mummy Project’s findings were widely reported as a groundbreaking discovery, only for subsequent research to dismantle their conclusions. While their work was based on legitimate scientific inquiry, the study demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary verification in mummy research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest team of researchers concluded that this case should “resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer.” Going forward, they recommend shifting focus to broader questions, such as maternal health in ancient Egypt, rather than isolated cases that might be misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

She said she was also experiencing dizziness, blurred vision, and a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Three women were found dead in the above hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in San Pedro on February 22. DailyMail.com's source 'Jane' arrived just over a week later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The victims: Kaoutar Naqqad, 23, Imane Mallah, 24, and Wafae El Arar, 26. A source close to one of their families says preliminary autopsy results show signs of carbon monoxide poisoning &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Excepts from a text exchange between Jane and a representative of Royal Kahal show the hotel assuring Jane's safety, insisting the women's deaths were caused by a drug overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she attempted to get up to go to the restroom, Jane said she collapsed to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I laid on the ground for, I’d say, at least 30 to 40 minutes because I could not pull myself up, I just had no strength in my body, it was the weirdest thing,’ shared Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane eventually gathered the strength to get up. She spent the next three hours seated in a chair by an open window before she was finally able to walk uninhibited again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five days after returning home to California, Jane says she is still struggling with headaches, a cough, brain-fog, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said that one of her friends on the trip has also been suffering from recurring migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the symptoms described by Jane are textbook side effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after reading a report by DailyMail.com earlier this week about Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths possibly being &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14487175/american-women-dead-belize-dramatic-twist-new-theory.html"&gt;caused by carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning that Jane connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It all started to make perfect sense because I was completely out of it, and I did not feel right,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Every morning after that, I felt like I was in a fog. And I still don’t feel right now, everything feels off.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane is seeking medical treatment and plans to reach out to Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy to report her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends on the trip was told by embassy officials that initial tests found some rooms at the hotel contained ‘high levels of carbon monoxide.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy have not returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review on Royal Kahal’s Trip Advisor page, dated March 1, complains of ‘critical safety concerns’ during a visit to the resort in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had a wonderful stay at Royal Kahal Beach Resort from February 17th-21st. The staff was exceptional - [the] front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, bartenders, and beach staff went above and beyond. The beauty of San Pedro, Belize, and the warmth of its people made this trip unforgettable,’ wrote user Naquana H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, I cannot, in good faith, rate the hotel highly due to serious safety concerns. On February 18th, our carbon monoxide detector went off with levels above 400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite informing the front desk, the staff seemed unfamiliar with the issue. Maintenance suggested turning off the gas, but the CO levels remained dangerously high. We were left feeling uneasy. The next morning, a friend reported dizziness, which we now suspect was from CO exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While the hotel is beautiful, the lack of CO detectors is concerning. I urge management to address this for the safety of future guests.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The women's families paid tribute to each of them in a heartfelt statement on Monday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A review posted on Trip Advisor just over a week ago complained of carbon monoxide exposure and 'critical' safety concerns at Royal Kahal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it remains to be seen whether Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, Jane said she’s furious the hotel lured her into a potentially dangerous situation with false promises of guaranteed safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her heart breaks for the women’s families and feels remarkably lucky to have avoided any serious harm herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They told us everything was safe, and we believed them. We had no reason not to,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I can’t get the girls and their families off my mind. It’s heartbreaking. But it’s also frightening knowing the same thing could’ve happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Who knows what would’ve happened if I was left to sleep in my room for another few hours, or if when I fell on the ground I couldn’t get up and nobody came to check on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just so sad those girls weren’t afforded the same luck.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said she realized all was not well at Royal Kahal almost immediately after she and her friends arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she says the staff were incredibly welcoming and the property was serene, there were signs plastered all over saying the hotel would be conducting smoke detector tests the following day between 9 am and 3 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Then all the weird stuff started happening,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next morning at 9 am, Jane said maids let themselves into her room and asked her if she was ready for house cleaning after she’d just emerged from the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she thought it odd at the time, what really stands out to Jane now is the fact that Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar had been dead for more than a day before hotel staff raised the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They were in our rooms every single morning,’ Jane said. ‘So I don’t know if they changed their policy after [the three women died] or if they knew more Americans were coming to make sure nobody else got sick - I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just found that really odd.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane left the hotel that morning and didn’t hear any alarm tests being carried out before she left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she returned, she found a worker with a ladder inside who was removing all of the smoke detectors from her room and her friend’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worker left the smoke detectors on the counter. One of Jane's friends called the front desk to ask whether they should reinstall them but were told ‘no’ and instructed to leave them on the counter where they remained for the rest of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on Wednesday March 5th and for the majority of the 6th, the gas and hot water were switched off. The gas was cut off for a second time on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane claims they were offered no explanation for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just find it incredibly odd that it was switched off twice when we were there,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a text message from the U.S. Embassy on March 7th, the last night of their trip, that really unnerved Jane and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the text message urged them to call ‘ASAP.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A male friend of Jane's called and was told that it was in ‘their best interest to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay for the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Embassy official didn’t elaborate any further, according to Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane and her group returned to the hotel to find several individuals wearing suits standing in the lobby of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the individuals, who Jane believes was Royal Kahal’s general manager, informed them the hotel would be shutting down for the week - but they had the option to stay for their final night if they felt safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fresh off a sunset cruise and with nowhere else to go at such short notice, Jane and her friends reluctantly stayed and flew back to the U.S. the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends called the U.S. Embassy after returning home and was allegedly informed that several of the hotel’s rooms were found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is so frightening because, I mean, this is happening within days of three people dying,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When that happened, they should have closed the hotel immediately. We never should’ve been allowed to stay there, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They fed us all this bulls**t about it being safe, but they didn’t even know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I want to make sure that hotel never opens its doors again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A second autopsy is currently being carried out on each of the women back in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Royal Kahal Beach Resort is a luxury hotel on Ambergris Caye, located in San Pedro, Belize (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar's remains were transported back to the U.S. earlier this month, where a second autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in their home state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The examinations are not expected to be completed for another month. However, a source close to one of the girls’ families told DailyMail.com earlier this week that a preliminary report indicated signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source further stated that investigators have discovered other non-fatal incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Royal Kahal and have made contact with at least one other American victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Royal Kahal, Belize Commissioner Williams, and Belize Fire Chief Colin Gillett have all been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gillett previously told Belizean media that carbon monoxide poisoning had been ruled out following an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson representing the families of Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar declined to comment, sharing only that the bereaved were eagerly awaiting the results of the state Medical Examiner’s second autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Massachusetts confirmed they have custody of the women’s remains but declined to share further details, with a spokesperson saying only that the 'cause and manner of death for the descendents remains pending.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Monday, the women’s families shared their first public statements about their deaths, calling them mysterious and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is with unimaginable pain and heartbreak that we share the devastating news of the passing of Kaoutar Naqqad, Imane Mallah, Wafae El Arar, each a beloved light in the world lost too soon,’ began the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families and all who loved these women are shattered, struggling to comprehend this profound and sudden loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An individual tribute was then paid to each of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallah was remembered as a ‘beacon of kindness’ who ‘embraced life wholeheartedly’; Naqqad was the light of her family’s life ‘whose kindness and warmth touched everyone she met’; and El Arar was ‘honest, kind, and deeply devoted to the people she loved’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their families added: ‘The circumstances surrounding this tragedy remain unclear and suspicious, and we are seeking answers to understand what happened in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We urge the authorities in Belize and in the United States to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation so that we may find the truth and justice for Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received during this heartbreaking time. We ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this profound sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace.

She said she was also experiencing dizziness, blurred vision, and a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Three women were found dead in the above hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in San Pedro on February 22. DailyMail.com's source 'Jane' arrived just over a week later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The victims: Kaoutar Naqqad, 23, Imane Mallah, 24, and Wafae El Arar, 26. A source close to one of their families says preliminary autopsy results show signs of carbon monoxide poisoning &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Excepts from a text exchange between Jane and a representative of Royal Kahal show the hotel assuring Jane's safety, insisting the women's deaths were caused by a drug overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she attempted to get up to go to the restroom, Jane said she collapsed to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I laid on the ground for, I’d say, at least 30 to 40 minutes because I could not pull myself up, I just had no strength in my body, it was the weirdest thing,’ shared Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane eventually gathered the strength to get up. She spent the next three hours seated in a chair by an open window before she was finally able to walk uninhibited again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five days after returning home to California, Jane says she is still struggling with headaches, a cough, brain-fog, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said that one of her friends on the trip has also been suffering from recurring migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the symptoms described by Jane are textbook side effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after reading a report by DailyMail.com earlier this week about Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths possibly being &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14487175/american-women-dead-belize-dramatic-twist-new-theory.html"&gt;caused by carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning that Jane connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It all started to make perfect sense because I was completely out of it, and I did not feel right,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Every morning after that, I felt like I was in a fog. And I still don’t feel right now, everything feels off.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane is seeking medical treatment and plans to reach out to Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy to report her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends on the trip was told by embassy officials that initial tests found some rooms at the hotel contained ‘high levels of carbon monoxide.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Royal Kahal and the U.S. Embassy have not returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review on Royal Kahal’s Trip Advisor page, dated March 1, complains of ‘critical safety concerns’ during a visit to the resort in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had a wonderful stay at Royal Kahal Beach Resort from February 17th-21st. The staff was exceptional - [the] front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, bartenders, and beach staff went above and beyond. The beauty of San Pedro, Belize, and the warmth of its people made this trip unforgettable,’ wrote user Naquana H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, I cannot, in good faith, rate the hotel highly due to serious safety concerns. On February 18th, our carbon monoxide detector went off with levels above 400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite informing the front desk, the staff seemed unfamiliar with the issue. Maintenance suggested turning off the gas, but the CO levels remained dangerously high. We were left feeling uneasy. The next morning, a friend reported dizziness, which we now suspect was from CO exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While the hotel is beautiful, the lack of CO detectors is concerning. I urge management to address this for the safety of future guests.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The women's families paid tribute to each of them in a heartfelt statement on Monday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A review posted on Trip Advisor just over a week ago complained of carbon monoxide exposure and 'critical' safety concerns at Royal Kahal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though it remains to be seen whether Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar’s deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, Jane said she’s furious the hotel lured her into a potentially dangerous situation with false promises of guaranteed safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her heart breaks for the women’s families and feels remarkably lucky to have avoided any serious harm herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They told us everything was safe, and we believed them. We had no reason not to,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I can’t get the girls and their families off my mind. It’s heartbreaking. But it’s also frightening knowing the same thing could’ve happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Who knows what would’ve happened if I was left to sleep in my room for another few hours, or if when I fell on the ground I couldn’t get up and nobody came to check on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just so sad those girls weren’t afforded the same luck.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane said she realized all was not well at Royal Kahal almost immediately after she and her friends arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she says the staff were incredibly welcoming and the property was serene, there were signs plastered all over saying the hotel would be conducting smoke detector tests the following day between 9 am and 3 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Then all the weird stuff started happening,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next morning at 9 am, Jane said maids let themselves into her room and asked her if she was ready for house cleaning after she’d just emerged from the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she thought it odd at the time, what really stands out to Jane now is the fact that Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar had been dead for more than a day before hotel staff raised the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They were in our rooms every single morning,’ Jane said. ‘So I don’t know if they changed their policy after [the three women died] or if they knew more Americans were coming to make sure nobody else got sick - I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just found that really odd.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane left the hotel that morning and didn’t hear any alarm tests being carried out before she left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she returned, she found a worker with a ladder inside who was removing all of the smoke detectors from her room and her friend’s rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worker left the smoke detectors on the counter. One of Jane's friends called the front desk to ask whether they should reinstall them but were told ‘no’ and instructed to leave them on the counter where they remained for the rest of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on Wednesday March 5th and for the majority of the 6th, the gas and hot water were switched off. The gas was cut off for a second time on March 8th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane claims they were offered no explanation for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I just find it incredibly odd that it was switched off twice when we were there,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a text message from the U.S. Embassy on March 7th, the last night of their trip, that really unnerved Jane and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said the text message urged them to call ‘ASAP.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A male friend of Jane's called and was told that it was in ‘their best interest to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay for the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Embassy official didn’t elaborate any further, according to Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane and her group returned to the hotel to find several individuals wearing suits standing in the lobby of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the individuals, who Jane believes was Royal Kahal’s general manager, informed them the hotel would be shutting down for the week - but they had the option to stay for their final night if they felt safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fresh off a sunset cruise and with nowhere else to go at such short notice, Jane and her friends reluctantly stayed and flew back to the U.S. the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Jane's friends called the U.S. Embassy after returning home and was allegedly informed that several of the hotel’s rooms were found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is so frightening because, I mean, this is happening within days of three people dying,’ said Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When that happened, they should have closed the hotel immediately. We never should’ve been allowed to stay there, and they shouldn’t have been allowed to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They fed us all this bulls**t about it being safe, but they didn’t even know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I want to make sure that hotel never opens its doors again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A second autopsy is currently being carried out on each of the women back in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Royal Kahal Beach Resort is a luxury hotel on Ambergris Caye, located in San Pedro, Belize (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar's remains were transported back to the U.S. earlier this month, where a second autopsy is being conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in their home state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The examinations are not expected to be completed for another month. However, a source close to one of the girls’ families told DailyMail.com earlier this week that a preliminary report indicated signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source further stated that investigators have discovered other non-fatal incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning at the Royal Kahal and have made contact with at least one other American victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Royal Kahal, Belize Commissioner Williams, and Belize Fire Chief Colin Gillett have all been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gillett previously told Belizean media that carbon monoxide poisoning had been ruled out following an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson representing the families of Naqqad, Mallah, and El Arar declined to comment, sharing only that the bereaved were eagerly awaiting the results of the state Medical Examiner’s second autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Massachusetts confirmed they have custody of the women’s remains but declined to share further details, with a spokesperson saying only that the 'cause and manner of death for the descendents remains pending.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Monday, the women’s families shared their first public statements about their deaths, calling them mysterious and suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is with unimaginable pain and heartbreak that we share the devastating news of the passing of Kaoutar Naqqad, Imane Mallah, Wafae El Arar, each a beloved light in the world lost too soon,’ began the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families and all who loved these women are shattered, struggling to comprehend this profound and sudden loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An individual tribute was then paid to each of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallah was remembered as a ‘beacon of kindness’ who ‘embraced life wholeheartedly’; Naqqad was the light of her family’s life ‘whose kindness and warmth touched everyone she met’; and El Arar was ‘honest, kind, and deeply devoted to the people she loved’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their families added: ‘The circumstances surrounding this tragedy remain unclear and suspicious, and we are seeking answers to understand what happened in Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We urge the authorities in Belize and in the United States to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation so that we may find the truth and justice for Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our families are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received during this heartbreaking time. We ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this profound sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace.

Five years ago, at age 46, just as the other big “C” was hitting the United States, I found a lump in my breast. I was reminded of this last month when I had my bi-yearly scans, which showed (thankfully) I’m still cancer-free. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five years is a big deal in cancer terms because if you make it that long without any recurrence, the chances of it coming back drop significantly. When I announced this news to a group of friends, it was met with encouraging sentiments and applause. I was touched but not surprised. I knew that “C” was the one I could talk about; it was the other one I couldn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned this lesson early on, in the spring of 2021, sitting at a barbecue. After surgery and treatments, I had been quarantined in my house for almost a year, and this was one of my first social outings. Perched on an outdoor sofa, I listened to two women beside me talk about how the virus had affected their children’s sports schedules and how boring their social lives had been during the last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Enough is enough,” one of them said with so much conviction you’d think she was a lawyer trying a case. “The whole thing was a bunch of bullshit!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I excused myself, went to the bathroom, sat on a closed toilet seat, and cried. Had we just had the same year? It felt like they must have been living in some kind of parallel universe. Did they not understand what it was like in the hospital? How could they want to just go on with their lives without at least acknowledging the depth of what had just happened to the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memories from those early days of COVID haunted me: the sidewalk outside the hospital where I sobbed as I hugged my husband goodbye on the day of my surgery. The terror in every set of eyes I met once inside. The empty hallways. The workers in full PPE. The way the nurses would do their best &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to touch me. The patient who was rolled past me in a hospital bed with a plastic hood over his head. The caution tape. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the doctor said, “If you get the virus, we won’t be able to treat you.” How I scrubbed my skin raw each time I returned home. How I laid awake night after night, wondering if tomorrow would be the day I’d catch the virus and die. How I needed a good mask, but there were none to buy and watched protesters on the news raging against having to wear one at all. How the government said not to panic, but more people got sick and died. And how the president said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZgJZgFZbU" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="“Just stay calm.

The consensus seemed to be that we, as a society, needed to move on from COVID as fast as possible without looking back — no time for reflection, no time for empathy, no time for remembrance. And for the most part, we did just that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were indications this may not have been the best plan — after the pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cases of depression and anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d325d0e4b0e72dd7fee7df" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10088605/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cases of depression and anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; rose significantly.

This thing that happened was in my DNA now whether I wanted it to be or not. And although I could see the attraction to put the blinders on, I just couldn’t seem to keep them up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The empty hospital where the author received treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Darcey Gohring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It started with anxiety attacks in crowded places. It moved on to ruminating over the slightest changes in my body — a tickle in my throat, a headache, a sneeze. The COVID and the cancer were enmeshed in my mind, so much so that a part of me believed if I succumbed to the first, the other would surely follow. My thoughts, which before the pandemic, had been filled with things like work assignments, my own kid’s game schedules and social plans, were overtaken by an all-consuming fear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when friends asked, “How are you doing?” I always replied, “Good,” because that is what I should’ve been, even if I wasn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logic told me if I acted like the person I was in March of 2020, I would become her again. So, I said yes when I got invitations, even though I wanted to say no. I smiled through cocktail parties and work events. I told myself: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is what people do, and the more you do it, the easier it will get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I took the subway, went to the theater, traveled, and said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;If all these other people are doing it, it must be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even when, amid those things, I did get a mild case of COVID and recovered, the anxiety remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The aftermath of a traumatic event can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and problems with emotional regulation (such as irritability and anger). I was experiencing almost all of those things and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew I couldn’t suppress them any longer, so I began therapy. Week after week, I told my story, and as I did, the worry finally began to fade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I learned that a common coping mechanism when people experience trauma is a detachment from thoughts and feelings. And as I grasped how this was true in relation to myself, I started to wonder: Is that what we, as a society, have done as well? After enduring one period of isolation, did we forgo grieving collectively in the aftermath to avoid feeling things that were too hard to hold? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, I live very much the way I did before COVID and cancer, but at times, I still feel my body tensing around crowds and unpredictable situations. And although I now have the tools to manage these moments, I wonder if they will ever go away. Just as having cancer has forever changed me, COVID did, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am not the same person I was before March of 2020, and neither are you. Whether we like it or not, we have all been changed by the other big “C.” Our COVID stories matter — whether they be from a first grader who missed their little league season, a teenager who had to do school online from the confines of their bedroom, a frontline worker, a grandparent who went a year without a hug, a once healthy adult who now suffers from long COVID, or one of the millions of people who lost a loved one. These experiences shaped us into the people we are today, they are a part of us now. To say those truths out loud is to know we were never alone, even when we were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping well is vital for energy and good health — but getting the right amount of different stages of sleep can make all the difference. Among the various sleep stages, two of the most well-known are REM sleep and deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is closely associated with cognition and emotions (not to mention vivid dreams). Meanwhile, deep sleep is crucial for immune function, physical restoration, and general well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need different amounts of each, and cycling through all of the sleep stages, including light sleep (also known as NREM 1 and NREM 2) is important to wake up feeling your best and promote good health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, we’re diving into all things REM sleep vs deep sleep for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-awareness-week-2025" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-awareness-week-2025"&gt;Sleep Awareness Week 2025&lt;/a&gt; — including what happens during each stage, when they occur, how much of each we need. Plus, we'll offer our top tips on how to get more of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-rem-sleep-3"&gt;What is REM sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep is a stage of sleep defined by rapid eye movement. Per a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219315155" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219315155" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020 review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, REM sleep “is a behavioral state, a brain state, a dream state, and a paradoxical state,” which highlights its status as perhaps the most unique sleep stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s typically classified as its own category compared to NREM sleep (aka non-REM sleep), the latter of which has three stages that include light sleep and deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During REM sleep, your brain is almost as active as when you’re awake, says &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.doctorrajd.com/" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.doctorrajd.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Raj Dasgupta, MD, FACP, FCCP, FAASM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical advisor for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sleepopolis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a quadruple board certified physician in internal medicine, pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-deep-sleep-3"&gt;What is deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep is also known as slow-wave sleep, as your brain waves notably slow down to prompt significant rest and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deep sleep is the most physically restorative stage,” says Dr Dasgupta, underscoring its importance to not only help you wake up feeling refreshed but also support overall health and vitality over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Since it’s such a deep state, waking up from it can leave you feeling groggy,” he adds. Moreover, if you don’t get enough deep sleep, you may feel foggy and fatigued the next day — even if you logged the requisite &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-much-sleep-do-adults-need"&gt;&lt;u&gt;7 to 9 hours of sleep per night&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that most adults need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-what-do-they-both-do"&gt;&lt;span&gt;REM sleep vs Deep sleep: What do they both do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stages are equally as important for us to wake up feeling rested and restored, ready for another day ahead. However, each take on very different roles to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-rem-sleep-3"&gt;The role of REM sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“REM sleep is when most vivid dreaming happens,” says Dr Dasgupta. “Your voluntary muscles stay paralyzed so you don’t act out dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: You can dream during other stages of sleep, but those dreams may be more fragmented and easier to forget upon waking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“REM sleep is key for memory, learning, and emotional processing,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-deep-sleep-3"&gt;The role of deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep — also called the N3 stage of NREM sleep — is arguably the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-many-sleep-stages-are-there-and-which-is-the-best" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-many-sleep-stages-are-there-and-which-is-the-best"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most important sleep stage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During deep sleep, your brain waves slow way down, your body repairs itself, and your immune system gets a boost,” Dr Dasgupta shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is also when growth hormones are released,” he adds. This means deep sleep is essential for physical recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-when-do-they-occur"&gt;&lt;span&gt;REM sleep vs Deep sleep: When do they occur?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cycle through different sleep stages throughout the night, with REM sleep occurring about 90 minutes after you fall asleep,” Dr Dasgupta explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first REM period is usually short, while subsequent REM stages gradually lengthen as you approach the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your first REM stage may be only a few minutes in length while the final REM stage &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;can last up to an hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, deep sleep happens mostly in the first half of the night, says Dr Dasgupta. Since we need enough deep sleep to feel rested — not to mention facilitate major repair and restoration of the brain and body — it makes sense we 'bank' it as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-rem-sleep-vs-deep-sleep-how-much-do-we-need"&gt;&lt;span&gt; REM sleep vs Deep sleep: How much do we need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-rem-sleep-do-we-need-3"&gt;How much REM sleep do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, REM typically accounts for around 25% of all sleep, or about 90 to 120 minutes per night. However, this requirement varies on a range of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Age, genetics, stress levels, and lifestyle all play a role,” Dr Dasgupta shares, each of which will dictate whether you need more or less REM sleep to feel and function your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep habits, alcohol, and an inconsistent schedule can throw things off, making it harder to get the right balance of sleep stages,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-deep-sleep-do-we-need-3"&gt;How much deep sleep do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might sound surprising due to deep sleep’s major influence on restoration, immunity, and brain health, but we actually need less of this sleep stage compared to REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most adults need about 1 to 2 hours of deep sleep per night,” says Dr Dasgupta, “but this isn’t an exact science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, deep sleep decreases with age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the ideal amount of deep sleep for you — as well as how much you’ll typically get — will vary on a host of factors such as your age, health conditions, medications, and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, deep sleep decreases with age,” he adds, so you naturally might log less of it in older adulthood than you did in your 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up, with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841578/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841578/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; that deep sleep (among other elements of sleep architecture) decreased up until the age of 60, when it appeared to plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-rem-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more REM sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can’t exactly train yourself to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-get-more-rem-sleep"&gt;get more REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, there are a number of lifestyle tips and tricks you can adopt to achieve more high-quality sleep on the whole, and thus increase likelihood of getting more REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="keep-a-regular-sleep-schedule-3"&gt;Keep a regular sleep schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want better sleep, consistency is key,” says Dr Dasgupta. As such, sticking to a regular sleep schedule is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it may be to cave into a late-night TV binging session or sleep in when you get the chance, inconsistent sleep and wake times are one of the biggest instigators getting in the way of solid rest each and every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Waking up at the same time each morning — even if you had a poor night’s rest prior — is wise since it’ll encourage sleepiness come bedtime, thus helping you bounce back to your regular sleeping window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoid-caffeine-and-alcohol-3"&gt;Avoid caffeine and alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dasgutpa also advises limiting caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evening. However, it’ll be in your best interest scaling back caffeine earlier in the day — with research suggesting at least &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 hours before bedtime&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to avoid sleep disruptions, though this will also vary based on your sensitivity to caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount will also impact your REM sleep. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024173/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024173/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of healthy men published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Biological Rhythms&lt;/em&gt; in 2021 found that participants who had 150 milligrams of caffeine three times daily over 10 days experienced delays in REM sleep, as well as greater difficulty waking up and feeling sleepy when they did, compared to a group that underwent caffeine withdrawal, and a placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, alcohol &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/healthu/2023/06/14/heres-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/healthu/2023/06/14/heres-how-alcohol-affects-your-sleep" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduces the amount of REM sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you get — not to mention contributes to nighttime awakenings and lowers your overall sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="manage-stress-and-anxiety-3"&gt;Manage stress and anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and anxiety are likely to get in the way of achieving a good night’s rest and a healthy balance of sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that when experimental stressors were applied in studies, REM sleep, deep sleep and sleep efficiency were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4266573/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that major stressors may increase REM sleep but reduce deep sleep. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3317042/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3317042/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;REM rebound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is when we spend more time in REM sleep, may help mental recovery; however, losing deep sleep in the process will be disadvantageous for your energy levels, physical restoration, and long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Dr Dasgupta advises managing stress through your preferred relaxation techniques — be it reading, meditating, listening to music, doing gentle yoga, or another method — if worry and rumination lead you to have trouble falling asleep or feel poorly rested upon waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-get-more-deep-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to get more deep sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the case with REM sleep, you can’t will yourself to boost the amount of deep sleep you get every night.

This is especially beneficial to normalize your circadian rhythm (aka your sleep-wake cycles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight indicates that it’s time to wake up and will supress melatonin (aka the sleep hormone) production to give you more energy for you morning and afternoon&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/light-mornings-are-the-answer-to-better-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/light-mornings-are-the-answer-to-better-sleep"&gt;daylight as early in the day&lt;/a&gt; as possible will also help ensure that melatonin will release at the right time in the evening so you’re primed for sleepiness and snoozing come bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="increase-exercise-during-the-day-3"&gt;Increase exercise during the day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;Exercise can improve your sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Dr Dasgupta advises staying active during the day, which will also play a role in regulating your circadian rhythm. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270305/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270305/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that boosting your daytime energy expenditure is an effective way to increase deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t make it to the gym or a workout class, you can simply increase your step count throughout the day. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;One 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; showed this improved sleep efficiency, reduce stress, and lower daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To encourage deep sleep, Dr Dasgupta also advises refraining from intense activity too close to bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While daytime exercise &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904822/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904822/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can increase deep sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and decrease the time it takes to fall asleep, intense nighttime workouts may have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="create-an-ideal-environment-for-sleep-3"&gt;Create an ideal environment for sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, your overall sleep environment will have a major influence on how quickly you fall asleep and how restful your ZZZ’s can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you’ll want to invest in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-mattresses" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-mattresses"&gt;&lt;u&gt;best mattress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for your sleeping position, body size, and personal requirements. Beyond that, there are many other elements worth prioritizing to support deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creating a cool, dark, and quiet bedroom can help you get deeper, higher-quality sleep,” says Dr Dasgupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthy purchases to create this ideal kind of sleep environment include blackout shades, breathable bedding, fans, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/how-does-white-noise-help-you-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/reference/how-does-white-noise-help-you-sleep"&gt;&lt;u&gt;white noise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; machines or apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list takeaway-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown fat, unlike white fat, burns calories and can boost exercise performance by improving blood flow to muscles during physical activity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mice with enhanced brown fat lived 20% longer and showed 30% better exercise performance, with the benefits transferable through tissue transplantation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rutgers researchers are developing a drug that could activate brown fat in humans, potentially helping people maintain physical fitness as they age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. —&lt;/strong&gt; The next breakthrough in anti-aging medicine might come from a surprising source: fat. But not just any fat—brown fat, a special type that burns energy rather than storing it. Researchers at Rutgers University are developing a pill that could boost this beneficial tissue’s activity, after discovering its remarkable effects on exercise capacity and lifespan in mice. Their work suggests that activating brown fat could be the key to staying physically fit as we age, with a drug potentially available for testing within a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research paper published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/206179/text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brown fat&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just for keeping us warm—it actively contributes to better exercise performance and potentially extends our healthy years. The paper, authored by Dorothy E. Vatner, Jie Zhang, and Stephen F. Vatner from Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, offers a fresh perspective on fat tissue and its surprising connections to exercise capacity and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Exercise capacity diminishes as you get older, and to have a technique that could enhance exercise performance would be very beneficial for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthful aging&lt;/a&gt;,” said Stephen Vatner, university professor and director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute in the medical school’s Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine and senior author of the study, in a statement. “This mouse model performs exercise better than their normal littermates.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-all-fat-is-created-equal"&gt;Not All Fat Is Created Equal&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people think of fat as something to lose, but brown fat, (also known as brown adipose tissue) &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brown-fat-protects-from-chronic-illnesses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;works differently&lt;/a&gt; from the white fat we typically try to shed. This special tissue burns calories rather than storing them, generating heat through a process called thermogenesis. While scientists have known about brown fat’s heat-producing abilities for decades, the connection between the tissue and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exercise performance&lt;/a&gt; represents a fascinating new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Rutgers team has been studying a particular genetic model—mice lacking a protein called regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14)—that exhibit dramatically &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cutting-calories-slow-cell-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extended lifespans&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced exercise performance. Their research found that these long-lived mice have more potent brown fat, which appears to be directly responsible for their impressive physical abilities and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The color difference between white and brown fat isn’t just cosmetic. Brown fat cells contain numerous mitochondria—cellular power plants that give these cells their distinctive brown color. These mitochondria are packed with a protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which allows them to generate heat instead of the usual cellular energy currency, ATP. This metabolic flexibility makes brown fat uniquely positioned to influence whole-body energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impressive-results-from-brown-fat-transplantation"&gt;Impressive Results From Brown Fat Transplantation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ most compelling evidence comes from transplantation experiments. When they transplanted brown fat from the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice into normal mice, the recipients experienced dramatically enhanced exercise performance within just three days. In contrast, normal mice receiving brown fat transplants from other normal mice also showed improvement—but only after eight weeks. This suggests that the brown fat from the long-lived mice possesses unique properties that can rapidly boost exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists say that the transplanted brown fat increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the legs during exercise, promoting better oxygen and nutrient delivery to working muscles. It also stimulated the formation of new blood vessels and increased the density of existing ones. In essence, the brown fat was helping to build a more efficient circulatory system for delivering fuel during physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice produced unusually high amounts of active brown fat and showed about 30% better exercise performance than normal mice, both in speed and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/muscles-exercise-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;time to exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, several pathways appear to be activated by the enhanced brown fat, including SIRT3 (a longevity-associated protein), MEK/ERK signaling, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These pathways collectively improve mitochondrial function, reduce &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/oxidative-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, and enhance blood flow—all critical factors for exercise performance and potentially for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-better-with-brown-fat"&gt;Aging Better With Brown Fat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection to aging becomes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-cup-of-coffee-activates-calorie-burning-brown-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;even more apparent&lt;/a&gt; when examining the physical appearance of the genetically modified mice. Normal mice show typical signs of aging—&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/gray-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;graying fur,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hair-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, and general body atrophy—but the long-lived RGS14 knockout mice maintain a more youthful appearance well into old age. Even at advanced ages, they maintain a healthier appearance, avoiding the typical signs of aging that appear in normal elderly mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modified mice live &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/flexibility-key-to-longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;about 20% longer&lt;/a&gt; than normal mice, with females living longer than males – similar to the pattern seen in humans. While the paper doesn’t explore the gender difference in depth, it raises intriguing questions about sex hormones and their potential interaction with brown adipose tissue function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical applications extend far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-home-gyms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the gym&lt;/a&gt;. If brown fat truly has the protective effects suggested by this research, it could become a therapeutic target for preventing or treating a host of age-related conditions. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are all mentioned as potential conditions that might respond to brown fat-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With all the medical advances, aging and longevity have increased in humans, but unfortunately, healthful aging hasn’t,” Vatner said. “There are a lot of diseases associated with aging – obesity, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, cancer – and what we have to do is find new drugs based on models of healthful aging.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-lab-to-real-life"&gt;From Lab to Real Life&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than develop a treatment that addresses aging broadly, which poses regulatory challenges, Vatner said his team plans to test for specific benefits such as improved exercise capacity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This approach builds on their previous success in developing a drug based on a different mouse healthful longevity model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with some people to develop this agent, and hopefully, in another year or so, we’ll have a drug that we can test,” Vatner said. He added that most people would prefer to increase brown fat levels by taking pills rather than ice baths and is optimistic about translating the newest finding into an effective medication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wondering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/off-switch-brown-fat-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how to activate&lt;/a&gt; their own brown fat now, current science suggests that cold exposure is one of the most effective natural stimulants. When we’re cold, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, which binds to receptors on brown fat cells and activates UCP1-mediated heat production. In the meantime, techniques such as deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat naturally. Studies have found such efforts to produce short-term benefits that range from enhanced immune system function to improved metabolic health, but Vatner said none of the studies have run long enough to find any effect on healthful aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the path from these mouse studies to human applications remains uncertain, but study authors are hopeful that a brown fat-activating drug is in reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically modified mouse lacking the regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14 knockout mice), which they compared to normal mice. To determine if brown fat was responsible for the benefits they observed, the team performed transplantation experiments, surgically moving brown fat from RGS14 KO mice into normal mice, then testing the recipients’ exercise performance on specialized treadmills. They measured hind limb blood flow using imaging techniques and examined tissue samples for signs of new blood vessel formation. The team also analyzed molecular markers to identify the specific cellular pathways involved in the effects of brown fat on exercise capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-and-limitations"&gt;Results and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The genetically modified mice lived about 20% longer than normal mice and showed approximately 30% better exercise performance. When brown fat from these mice was transplanted into normal mice, the recipients experienced enhanced exercise capacity within just three days, compared to the eight weeks needed for normal mice receiving brown fat from other normal mice. The improved performance came with increased blood flow to the hind limbs and higher density of blood vessels in the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the study has limitations. Mouse models don’t always translate directly to human physiology, and the transplantation approach isn’t directly applicable as a human intervention. The paper also notes inconsistent findings in the field regarding the effects of exercise on brown fat, suggesting complex relationships that may vary based on intensity, duration, and individual factors.&lt;/p&gt;

It produces butyrate, a sign of gut fermentation that suggests good digestion and nutrient absorption, Segata explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"It’s probably producing short-chain fatty acids, which are supposed to be positive modulators of immunity,” Segata adds. Still, he says that “strong data” is needed to learn more about what this actually does for your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;What he does know is that there’s a solid link between coffee consumption and the presence of &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;. Segata and fellow researchers actually fed coffee to  &lt;em&gt;L. asaccharolyticus &lt;/em&gt;that was growing in petri dishes and found it made the bacteria grow faster. “It’s clear that the coffee was stimulating it,” Segata says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This stimulation is possibly due to metabolites in the coffee. Plus, it's “probably not the caffeine, because decaf had a similar effect," Segata adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-get--l-asaccharolyticus-from-other-foods" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get  &lt;em&gt;L.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt; from other foods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As of now, this bacterium is just linked to coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, aronia berries contain chlorogenic acid and polyphenols like coffee, so they may have a similar effect, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danbee Kim" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert, weight loss surgeon, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “Other foods high in chlorogenic acid—such as blueberries, apples, and pears—might also support the growth of this gut bacteria, though more research is needed to confirm this,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-coffee-do-i-need-to-drink-to-reap-the-gut-benefits" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much coffee do I need to drink to reap the gut benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Having a cup or two of coffee a day promotes the growth of &lt;em&gt;L.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;asaccharolyticus&lt;/em&gt;, Segata says. But he points out that “heavy” coffee drinkers, who have three or more coffees a day, have up to 10 times more of the bacteria in their gut compared to people who don’t drink coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-any-negative-impacts-of-coffee-on-gut-health" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any negative impacts of coffee on gut health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few to keep in mind. The biggest potential drawback is that it could raise your risk of acid reflux, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rudolph Bedford" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Rudolph Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“It also increases gastrointestinal mobility and can potentially cause diarrhea,” he says.

They urged New Yorkers not to feed their pets raw food or raw milk and to avoid letting them roam outside where they could encounter wild birds or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk that bird flu presents to New Yorkers remains low, the health department said. Human-to-human transmission of the avian influenza virus remains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt; and has not occurred during the current outbreak in the United States, which began in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is possible for someone to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-humans.html#:~:text=Other%20animals%20infected%20with%20avian,or%20mouth%2C%20or%20is%20inhaled." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;contract bird&lt;/a&gt; flu from an animal if they come into contact with the animal’s organs, blood or other bodily fluids, including milk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2022, 70 people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. and one has died, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88wzzsx002t2cqlgiu2brlq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three months into 2025, the United States has surpassed the total number of measles cases in the country for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3f2s000d3b6muukucs34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So far in 2025, there have been at least 308 measles cases reported in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024, there were 285 measles cases. The high numbers are driven by a large outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3gdi000i3b6m47ifgdpy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the years since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 measles cases reported each year. There have been an average of about 8 outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But the worst outbreaks each year typically stay under 50 cases. 2025 is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year that an outbreak has led to more than 200 cases. The others were the Disneyland outbreak that started in 2014 and 2019 when a nearly year-long outbreak in New York came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm88x3gdi000j3b6mv5itxvem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death – a school-aged child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico said last week they are investigating the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles. The Lea County resident had not sought out health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Pictured above is virologist Shi Zhengli, known as 'Batwoman' for her work on coronaviruses in Wuhan. Some suggest that the Covid pandemic was triggered by a leak from her laboratory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'To find out more, we plan to conduct experiments in Hong Kong during the current year.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MERS is a contagious respiratory illness spread from animals to humans and from human to human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and vomiting, and can be fatal in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two patients in the US have ever tested positive for MERS — both in May 2014 — and each case was linked to travel from the Middle East. There is no vaccine against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worldwide, the virus has triggered 2,613 cases and 943 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the research, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.70173?logout=true"&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took 423 oral and rectal swabs from 15 species of bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab analyses revealed the seven coronavirus strains were genetically different to any known pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The viruses were found in the velvety free-tailed bat and great fruit-eating bat, which both live across South America and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Defending the paper, virologist Dr Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, who was also involved in the research, said: 'Bats are important viral reservoirs and should thereofre be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This monitoring helps identify circulating viruses and risks of transmission to other animals, and even to humans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14421599/coronavirus-potential-cause-pandemic-discovered-china.html"&gt;three weeks&lt;/a&gt; after scientists in China revealed they had discovered yet another coronavirus that could spread to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scenes eerily reminiscent of the beginnings of the Covid pandemic, researchers at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology detected the new strain living within bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is strikingly similar to the pandemic virus, sparking fears that history could repeat itself just two years after the worst was declared over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Update:  since the public meeting of the vaccine advisory committee was cancelled, representatives of the CDC, FDA, and Department of Defense (!) met in closed session to decide to use the WHO selections of which strains to use for this fall's flu vaccines.  So there will be vaccines, RFKJr can take a hike. He probably does less damage when he's away hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traveler came through LAX airport on March 5 in the evening, and is now a confirmed measles case.  They also visited a nail salon and a grocery store while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Europe had  32,265 measles cases, the vast majority of them in Romania. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/la-county-reports-first-measles-case-2025-lax-traveler-cases-confirmed-philadelphia-ny" target="_blank"&gt;More than 27,000 of them&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the great majority were unvaccinated. Ten Europeans died of measles in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-years-pandemic-world-poorly.html" target="_blank"&gt;We aren't ready for the next pandemic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH cancelled dozens of studies into vaccine hesitancy and ways to increase vaccine uptake.  Because they want us to get sick, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/nih-cuts-research-grants-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-vaccine-studies-next-target" target="_blank"&gt;Not enough Rs in GRRRRRRR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Michigan counties have now found chronic wasting disease in farmed deer.  It was first noted in wild deer in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings challenge traditional assumptions about exercise and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Jyväskylä examined how long-term physical activity affects mortality and whether it can counteract genetic risks for disease. The team also explored role of exercise in biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts analyzed 22,750 Finnish twins born before 1958. Their leisure-time &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-reduces-the-risk-of-brain-diseases-by-up-to-54-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; was assessed in 1975, 1981, and 1990. The researchers followed up on mortality data through the end of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moderate-activity-yields-maximum-benefits"&gt;Moderate activity yields maximum benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified four activity groups: sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active. Over 30 years, the biggest difference was found between the sedentary and moderately active groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderately active individuals had a 7% lower mortality risk. However, those in the highly active group did not show additional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strength-training-may-be-the-best-exercise-for-insomnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, more physical activity correlated with lower mortality. However, in the long run, highly active individuals had no advantage over those who were sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An underlying pre-disease state can limit physical activity and ultimately lead to death, not the lack of exercise itself,” said Professor Elina Sillanpää from the Faculty of Sports and Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can bias the association between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and mortality in the short term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-guidelines-and-mortality-risk"&gt;Exercise guidelines and mortality risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts also evaluated whether following World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) physical activity guidelines influenced mortality and genetic disease risk. The WHO recommends 150–300 minutes of moderate or 75–150 minutes of vigorous activity weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study showed that meeting these guidelines did not lower mortality risk. Even twins who followed the recommendations for 15 years showed no significant difference in mortality rates compared to their less active siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widely observed favorable association between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and mortality are based on observational studies that are prone to bias from different sources,” noted postdoctoral researcher Laura Joensuu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our studies, we aimed to account for various sources of biases, and combined with the long follow-up period, we could not confirm that adhering to physical activity guidelines mitigates genetic cardiovascular disease risk or causally reduces mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-and-biological-aging"&gt;Exercise and biological aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a subset of twins, the researchers analyzed biological aging using epigenetic clocks. These clocks estimate biological aging based on chemical markers that regulate gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a U-shaped pattern. Both the least and most active individuals experienced accelerated biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the association between leisure-time physical activity and biological aging was U-shaped: Biological aging was accelerated in those who exercised the least and the most,” said Sillanpää.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol use played a major role in the link between &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-is-far-more-important-than-weight-for-living-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and biological aging. The study also examined genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease and blood pressure using polygenic risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-exercise-does-not-slow-aging"&gt;More exercise does not slow aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research challenges the widely held belief that more exercise always leads to a longer life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While physical activity is beneficial for overall health, its impact on longevity is more complicated than previously assumed. Moderate exercise appears to offer the best balance, while excessive activity does not necessarily add extra years to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also highlight the importance of considering other factors, such as lifestyle habits and genetic predisposition. Exercise alone may not be enough to overcome genetic risks. Other aspects of health, such as diet, stress management, and avoiding harmful habits, play a crucial role in aging and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may further clarify the relationship between physical activity and lifespan. In the meantime, individuals should aim for a balanced approach to exercise, focusing on overall well-being rather than just lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved researchers from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences and the Methodology Centre for Human Sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Jyväskylä&lt;/a&gt;. Experts at the Finnish Institute of Molecular Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; also contributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-024-01200-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 14:59:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNWjRYZ1c3VHFHLXVJWTF3bmMxTmJMVDAyOWJ1U2liZS1pWGM3TV9ESWpBUmFFaDY4WjExRFBJRkNJTFdBM1JFd05iVDhkWTNGOF9qd25mNWhGREZZZ2FMX0JwdU5uNk80TjVtZEJwYUs1RjRJa3JkdmJfTjF4eDFHalAzd3BqWDloRERPVDdicm9OQQ</guid></item><item><title>Former CDC director argues for stronger, nationwide guidance on infant measles vaccine dose - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The former director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for stronger, nationwide guidance on infant vaccine doses for measles prevention in a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831828" target="_blank"&gt;new opinion paper&lt;/a&gt; published Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the face of a growing measles outbreak -- with more than 200 cases confirmed in western Texas -- the federal health agency issued an &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; on March 7 saying parents in the outbreak area should consider getting their children an early third dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at £250 a month. He told us then that he felt "very fortunate" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that "it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone "off patent" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Each year, NHS England can make "discretionary" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at "the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes", and ministers would not intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Turner said he was "stunned" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has spent £20,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS £77 per pack per month - could not be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 14:30:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBsUXRGVy14Sk5jWkhic2xfQUMtN0Jfd2xSRW80aXRpeVFpM0RXVGZ4eHBXZmhBMHB3R3lwck5mWVFJcmZpVVFYYXNoMnBTdUZyRzFYbTJlNEFJd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1va2lJQi1mNG5ySU4tNEhXMUQ5eFlQeXlEQ05CSHpQVzVhaDI0QkFtSXVtcW1Bc21kYjVxRFF4S3V2eVBZWmNwbTgzRl85Vmgxb2lTM3ZEWTlMVThfdVk0</guid></item><item><title>Tragedy Story After After Doctors Send 10-Year-Old Maryland Girl Home From the Hospital - The Root</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNZlEwLXM0YTRxWWpPN1NUcjZxYjgtWDhuMU1xTDBQYkZ5U2VwT3pYM1htVjJsZ19SRjNJSHp6N3dtUmJmTjNOYmF6dnVianFDOTBMeG9GZmxDMHhrM256czZXOHVzLXRuWnZIR2pFZ2g3c1pBbnlZSnU5eVFJQmxWVzhBTzJtN29EazktTzNjUExiYTVh?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-r43lxo-1 cwnrYD"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;A Maryland family is mourning the&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kMzRIQ js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","Internal link","https://www.theroot.com/the-nj-school-bus-aide-who-let-a-disabled-child-choke-t-1851769391",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.theroot.com/the-nj-school-bus-aide-who-let-a-disabled-child-choke-t-1851769391"&gt; tragic loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of a ten-year-old girl who they describe as the family’s light.

The short-term physical effects on &lt;a href="https://www.drugfreect.org/substance-info/alcohol/short-term-effects/"&gt;cognition and motor function&lt;/a&gt; speak for themselves. The longer-term &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/addiction-heavy-drinking"&gt;physical consequences of abusing alcohol&lt;/a&gt; — liver damage, jaundice, and cancer — have long been impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So why, in that case, has there been a widespread belief, even among many physicians, that moderate drinking might actually be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We can thank the so-called French paradox for this. In the early 1990s, French scientist &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51361649_Serge_Renaud_from_French_paradox_to_Cretan_miracle"&gt;Serge Renaud concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the French had low rates of cardiovascular disease despite their affinity for fatty foods like beef and cheese because they otherwise adhere to a healthy &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; — and because they consumed “moderate” amounts of red wine. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/red-wine/art-20048281#:~:text=Resveratrol%20in%20red%20wine,More%20research%20is%20needed."&gt;theorized that the antioxidants in red wine&lt;/a&gt; could play a role in reducing cholesterol, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Subsequent studies appeared to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193755"&gt;affirm the correlation&lt;/a&gt;, strengthening the belief among the general public about the benefits of red wine. But over the past decade, new studies and &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155"&gt;public health warnings&lt;/a&gt; have called that conventional wisdom into question, stating emphatically that no level of alcohol consumption could be considered safe — much less beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Alcohol after all, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health"&gt;absolutely is a toxin&lt;/a&gt;, and has long been recognized by experts, if not the broader public, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html"&gt;as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Since many people enjoy alcohol to some extent, says Timothy Naimi, director of the University of Victoria’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, “there’s been a far more relaxed scientific standard.” “We all love studies that show, ‘oh, sex makes us live longer, or coffee is good for us, or chocolate is good for us.’ There is this irresistible idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Science has clearly established that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html"&gt;excessive drinking is bad for you&lt;/a&gt;. But what remains confusing, especially with the steady stream of new studies that sometimes seem to contradict each other, is how bad moderate drinking is — and what “moderate” even means. Here’s what we actually know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="moderate-drinking-is-elusive-and-its-very-easy-to-drink-too-much" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Moderate” drinking is elusive — and it’s very easy to drink too much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the most important things to understand about drinking and its health effects is what amount of alcohol is actually considered to be excessive. It is &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/is-it-time-to-rethink-how-much-you-drink"&gt;a common trope&lt;/a&gt; among doctors and alcohol researchers that people misunderstand what moderate drinking means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“None of us like to think of ourselves as drinking to excess, right?” Naimi said. “Who among us wants to think of ourselves as immoderate? Of course, we’re all moderate drinkers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Diners in Paris.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Corbis/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even if we agree in colloquial terms that “one drink a night” is moderate, the details matter. Medical science has far more &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2024/12/americas-most-common-drug-problem-unhealthy-alcohol-use"&gt;precise definitions for what constitutes a “drink”&lt;/a&gt; than the average person pouring themselves a glass of Chablis. One 12-ounce can of 5-percent alcohol beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine with 12-percent alcohol, or a 1.5-ounce glass of 80-proof liquor are all what constitutes a “standard drink.” So when we pour an extra-large glass of wine at night, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; may consider it only one drink, but a doctor sees two or even three. The kind of beer or wine matters too: Your favorite 9 percent IPA is actually closer to two drinks than it is to one, according to medical definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People today are considered by the medical establishment to be heavy drinkers if, by these definitions, they consume more than 15 drinks in a week for men or more than eight drinks for women. (You are considered to have &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt; if you have tried to stop drinking in the past year but failed, have alcohol cravings, or believe drinking interferes with your life. It’s less about specific amounts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below that threshold, based on these scientific standards, you might consider yourself to be a so-called moderate drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This reflects a lot of progress in our understanding of problematic drinking. For centuries, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-conflicted-history-of-alcohol-in-western-civilization/"&gt;people have known that excessive drinking&lt;/a&gt; could damage the liver, cause long-term health problems, and lead to alcohol dependence. The US temperance movement of the 1800s and early 1900s sought to eradicate those personal and social harms and briefly succeeded in outlawing alcohol during the Prohibition era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, as the failure of Prohibition attests, drinking is deeply embedded in our society. Some popular historians like to say that &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/alcohol-caffeine-created-civilization"&gt;alcohol (along with caffeine) helped define human civilization&lt;/a&gt;. There may even be &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(24)00240-4"&gt;an evolutionary angle&lt;/a&gt;: Many animals consume alcohol (called ethanol when it is encountered naturally). Perhaps it’s because finding fruit with some fermented ethanol means you’re good at finding fruit, period — a natural advantage for survival. That is how deeply rooted our ancestral relationship to alcohol might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even today, one of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4211338/"&gt;scheduled around drinking&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;let’s go to happy hour&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;grab some drinks for the big game&lt;/em&gt;, for example. Given the seemingly implacability of social drinking, the focus for a long time has been trying to reduce the kind of habitual, excessive drinking that we have historically called alcoholism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And there was some progress made: Americans collectively report &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/03/10-facts-about-americans-and-alcohol-as-dry-january-begins/sr_2024-01-03_dry-january_05-png/"&gt;consuming less alcohol than they did&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s and ’80s. Today, an estimated 10 percent of Americans 12 and older are &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; as having alcohol use disorder, a number that has stayed fairly stable over the past decade. There is even evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/03/10-facts-about-americans-and-alcohol-as-dry-january-begins/sr_2024-01-03_dry-january_03-png/"&gt;younger people are drinking &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than millennials or Gen X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, however, alcohol-related deaths have been increasing, rising by &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-the-latest-alcohol-death-data-and-change-over-the-last-decade/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; from 2012 to 2022, even with a definition of alcohol-related deaths that is limited to liver disease, poisoning and accidents. The actual count, when considering deaths to which alcohol was at least a contributor, such as cancer in heavy drinkers, is more difficult to quantify but likely much higher. A 2024 estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the number at &lt;a href="/the-highlight/2023/11/6/23931877/alcohol-use-disorder-leading-cause-deaths-medication-therapy"&gt;178,000 deaths attributable to alcohol overuse&lt;/a&gt; annually in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These seemingly contradictory trends — stable rates of alcoholism, but increasing deaths — could be explained by a few things. For one, alcohol use disorder is likely underdiagnosed. Second, “heavy” drinkers may not be alcoholics, but they can still feel the negative health effects of their alcohol use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And then there is an issue that has been worrying doctors for years: &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/binge-drinking"&gt;binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;, usually defined as consuming four (for women) or five (for men) drinks in two hours or less. You may not necessarily be considered an alcoholic if you binge-drink; you may not even be a heavy drinker much of the time. But even more limited episodes of such intense drinking can do serious damages; the immediate risk is death from an accident or alcohol poisoning, but repeated binge drinking raises the risk of longer-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Put it all together and what’s become clear is that more people’s health is being put at risk by their alcohol use than was previously realized. And that means even people whose drinking is considered socially acceptable need to be aware of the threats it poses to their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="is-any-level-of-drinking-safe-or-even-beneficial" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Is any level of drinking safe or even beneficial?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Once you are having more than two drinks a day if you’re a man or one drink a day if you’re a woman, pretty much every researcher agrees that the health risks warrant trying to cut back. But the consensus fractures below that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If we imagine the conversation about alcohol’s health effects as a football field, the consensus covers 95 yards of the 100-yard field — almost all the way to the goal of general unanimity. We all agree heavy drinking is bad, but the fight remains on the issue — the remaining five yards — of whether &lt;em&gt;light &lt;/em&gt;drinking is truly bad and that is still being debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a quarter century after that conventional wisdom about red wine benefitting the human heart really took hold, a growing number of public health organizations and researchers started to aggressively dispute the idea that moderate alcohol consumption could be “safe” or beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“All of the arguing in the past 20 years has been around the health effects of very, very small amounts of alcohol,” Naimi said. “But I don’t think that other than small amounts of alcohol, there’s any question that alcohol consumption is a leading and preventable cause of health and social problems in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;One of the biggest challenges in trying to convince people to drink less is the fact that so much of our collective social calendar is scheduled around drinking.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One watershed moment was a 2017 publication from the American Society of Clinical Oncology that established that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112463/"&gt;even modest drinking could increase a person’s risk of developing cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The ASCO was alarmed by surveys that found only one in three Americans knew about the finding decades after medical literature had documented a link between, for example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3574368/"&gt;alcohol use and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And with its report, the group aimed to increase awareness among the public that alcohol is a carcinogen and advocate for specific policy strategies to try to reduce excessive alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5440363/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, also published in 2017, examined prior research alleging positive cardiovascular effects from moderate alcohol consumption. This analysis, which Naimi co-authored, found possible statistical errors and other countervailing factors in the earlier studies that appeared to support the French paradox’s framework. For example, moderate wine drinkers tend to be more moderate in general, more active, and in better overall health — all of which could help explain their better health outcomes, without alcohol factoring into it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, some of the apparent abstainers studied in the various observational studies of alcohol use and health outcomes &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.15433#:~:text=The%20present%20research%20reaffirms%20previous,an%20alcohol%2Drelated%20health%20condition."&gt;may be former drinkers&lt;/a&gt; who could still feel the health effects years later, which would explain the finding that some moderate drinkers live longer than both non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. More recent studies with more rigorous statistical randomization reported that “alcohol consumption of all amounts was associated with increased cardiovascular risk,” with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35333364/"&gt;risk increasing with every drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 2022, the World Health Organization took an even stronger position, stating that “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health#:~:text=The%20risks%20and%20harms%20associated,that%20does%20not%20affect%20health."&gt;no level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health&lt;/a&gt;” based on available evidence. As they put it, one’s risk appears to increase “from the first drop.” The board of scientists who advise the US government on diet guidelines, too, has advised that the guidance reduce the maximum recommended drinks for men from two to one daily, for example. Their input hasn’t yet been incorporated into the final federal dietary guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, you still have studies that came out in the past decade that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4981808/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;acknowledged the cancer risks but&lt;/a&gt; continued to report &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646330/"&gt;cardiovascular benefits&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26843157/"&gt;possible reduction in the risk of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; with modest drinking. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218856/"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that adhering to certain patterns — such as spacing your weekly allotment of drinks out over a few days and consuming them with a meal — may be beneficial. It’s understandable that people are confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here’s what you should know: This is really hard to study. We are mostly relying on observational data, not randomized controlled experiments, which could be compromised by all kinds of confounding factors. In an ideal world, you could compare two groups of people who are alike, except one drinks and the other doesn’t, for life. But in practice, that’s very difficult to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixj _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="industry-influence-has-shaped-our-ideas-about-alcohol-consumption" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry influence has shaped our ideas about alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our ability to make sense of all of the confusing science around drinking is further complicated by the influence of the alcohol industry, which airs advertising campaigns with messages like “drink responsibly” that reinforce the idea that a certain level of drinking can be responsible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;The industry also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/24/alcohol-tax-increases-stymied-by-industry-lobbyists-campaign-contributions/"&gt;lobbies lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to stymie any attempt to place new restrictions, requirements or taxes on them. One attempt to stand up a randomized alcohol study, which was to be overseen by Kenneth Mukamal of Harvard, was &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-end-funding-moderate-alcohol-cardiovascular-health-trial"&gt;shut down in 2018 because the alcohol industry&lt;/a&gt; had provided improper input on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of the researchers I spoke to acknowledged the challenge in substantiating alcohol’s effects, positive or negative, but again: Alcohol is a carcinogen; no one needs a randomized control trial to know that, it’s been the international consensus for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a reckoning with alcohol right now, which can leave people feeling unmoored. But all of this noise obscures the simple way to synthesize all of this: Less is better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I think for people that are light drinkers, they probably don’t need to put a ton of brain space here,” Noelle LoConte, who co-authored the ASCO’s 2017 statement on alcohol and cancer, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you want to drink less but not abstain completely, there are some obvious things you can do. Don’t pour too much wine in that glass. Maybe skip the 10 percent double IPA. In my own life, I have moderated my drinking by limiting myself to at most two nights per week and at most two drinks per night. I still get to enjoy my coveted Cabernet once in a while, but having some loose rules for myself has made it easier to reduce my intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The people who have one drink with dinner or two drinks with dinner, I think it’s exactly the right way to do it; that’s the right way to calibrate it,” Kenneth Mukamal, a Harvard doctor who authored several of the studies finding some cardiovascular benefits to moderate alcohol consumption, said. “You should have it with food. You should have it with friends and have it in a way that you’re naturally limited in how much you’re going to drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is also getting easier — and less awkward — to not drink at all if that’s your preference or you simply want to make a change.

&lt;p&gt;Although patients’ motor symptoms eased immediately after the three-month program, there didn’t appear to be a long-term effect on motor symptom severity, emphasizing a need for longer programs and/or further resources to help patients more effectively exercise on their own, the study’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2025.107777"&gt;Effect of an adapted physical activity program in Parkinson’s disease: A randomized controlled study (APA-Park)&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Parkinsonism and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/regular-exercise-eases-parkinsons-motor-symptoms-fatigue/"&gt;exercise can ease motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, yet Parkinson’s patients often struggle with exercising regularly. Physical limitations brought on by the disease can make some types of exercise difficult or impossible, and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like depression can interfere with motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapted physical activity, or APA, is a type of exercise program done under the supervision of a professional trainer who helps to tailor an exercise regimen to the person’s abilities, offering adjustments where needed. While APA might be more useful than unstructured exercise for Parkinson’s patients, there is limited data on its use in this population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Structured program vs free activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists in France conducted a study (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02816619?term=NCT02816619&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;NCT02816619&lt;/a&gt;) to explore the effects of APA in Parkinson’s, enrolling 44 participants with the condition. Half of them underwent a three-month APA program with one-hour sessions twice weekly, and the other half were instructed to freely practice physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of a three-month APA program combining moderate-intensity endurance training, muscle strengthening, and stretching on motor symptoms, body composition, heart and lung (cardiorespiratory) function and metabolic profiles in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardized assessments after three months showed that motor symptoms tended to ease slightly in patients who underwent APA, as shown by a statistically significant decrease in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 3 scores, which evaluate motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, patients who freely exercised experienced a worsening of motor symptoms. This distinction was consistent even after accounting for factors like treatments, disease duration, and the severity of motor symptoms before the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this randomized controlled study, we demonstrated that a 3-month APA program combining moderate-intensity endurance training, muscle reinforcement, and stretching led to a reduction of motor symptom severity immediately after the intervention … while in the same period of time [Parkinson’s] patients assigned to free practice of physical activity presented an increase of motor severity,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a follow-up six months after the APA program ended, however, motor symptom scores were similar for patients who’d done the program and for patients who’d exercised on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From our results, there is an immediate effect on [Parkinson’s] symptoms after the APA program, but no long-term benefit,” the researchers wrote. That suggests “the necessity to either pursue the program in the long run, which raises feasibility issues, or to offer after the initial program some means to help the patient pursue [physical activity] by himself over years, using remote support for example,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of body composition, metabolic profile, and cardiorespiratory function showed no differences between the APA group and the free-exercising group at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the study was limited by its small size, adding that additional research is needed to more fully assess the potential benefits and limitations of APA for Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Criteria may help guide treatment of dermatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have determined that dermatitis resulting from topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is distinct from eczema and is caused by an excess of an essential chemical compound in the body. Scientists from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identified treatments that could be studied in clinical trials for the condition based on their potential to lower levels of the chemical compound—called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), a form of vitamin B3. The findings were published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dermatitis is characterized by inflammation, itching, or burning sensations on the skin, and can result from various conditions including TSW and &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/eczema-atopic-dermatitis"&gt;eczema&lt;/a&gt;. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common cause of dermatitis and affects 10 to 30% of children and 2 to 10% of adults each year in the United States. Topical steroids—specifically glucocorticoids or topical corticosteroids—have long been used as a first-line treatment for dermatitis caused by eczema because the drugs are safe, effective, easy to apply, and considered well-tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people experience dermatitis after using topical steroids for prolonged periods of time and then stopping—a condition called TSW. Diagnosing and treating this condition is difficult because TSW is not well understood. Symptoms include skin redness, burning sensations, skin heat (thermal dysregulation), itching and peeling, which can even occur on parts of the body where topical steroids were not applied. As TSW and eczema have similar symptoms, it has been difficult to distinguish the two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand TSW, a team led by scientists in NIAID’s Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology evaluated a previous survey that included 1,889 adults with symptoms similar to eczema. By dividing the participants into those with self-reported TSW and those without, the researchers identified characteristics unique to TSW. The researchers then conducted a pilot study including 16 people with symptoms consistent with TSW, 10 people with eczema but no symptoms of TSW, and 11 people without skin disease. They found that people with TSW symptoms had elevated levels of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;in their blood serum and skin, while NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were within a typical range in people without TSW symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers subsequently used cultured skin cells and a mouse model to mimic TSW conditions. They found that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was produced in response to topical steroids and caused inflammation. The models suggested that administration of a drug that blocked the formation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;—called a mitochondrial complex I blockade—would improve TSW symptoms. In a pilot study to further assess this treatment strategy, the researchers evaluated subjective responses among study participants who used the mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs metformin, berberine, or both. After three to five months of use, most participants reported improvement in TSW symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists provisionally established criteria that can be used by health care providers to identify TSW in people. People who have stopped topical steroid treatment and meet the criteria may be diagnosed by practitioners as having TSW. The researchers suggest that patients identified as having TSW could be treated using the proposed mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this study may help practitioners identify TSW in patients and work towards developing safe and effective treatments. According to the researchers, more research is needed to determine whether all patients with TSW have an excess of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or if there are other features that define TSW. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria will help health care providers and researchers to better understand the prevalence of TSW and evaluate the effects of using topical steroids.&lt;/p&gt;

So far this year, there have been more than &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/21/measles-cases/"&gt;250 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, compared to 285 cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the measles outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html?utm_campaign=SPOTREPS&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Cun0COYpVOlWGsNYFof9rVNPI3BOB4uZe66ZTd8EI1NT2WH7XFwJlbbxQ80c6KpwGQg6kaI-XWKd6YL9oOiP3_i_eKg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351798716&amp;amp;utm_content=351798716&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt; to spread&lt;/a&gt; and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people vaccinated for the disease will have lifelong protection, there are some instances when another dose is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Do you need a booster?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to know if you need a measles booster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best defense against measles is two doses of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine during childhood. With those, you are considered fully vaccinated for life and do not need a booster shot, even if there is an outbreak in your area. The two-dose regimen began in 1989.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may need another shot if you received the MMR vaccine between 1963 and 1968 because you may have received a “killed” measles vaccine used at the time, which is not adequate protection. The current vaccine is live, meaning it has a small, weakened dose of measles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, you likely had only one shot, which the CDC recommended at the time.  A single dose is about 93% effective against measles. If you are traveling to places with high rates of measles or lower vaccination rates than the U.S., you may want to get a second shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not need a booster shot if you were born before 1957 because you likely were infected in childhood and have presumed protection against measles.  “If you got measles as a child, you don’t need to worry, because that’s the best immunity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/find-a-doctor/detail/leslie-diaz-1750342689"&gt;Dr. Leslie Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease specialist with Palm Beach Health Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public health experts recommend a booster if you work in healthcare or plan to travel to areas with outbreaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are immunocompromised or pregnant, you should not get a booster. There is a risk of the live virus crossing the placenta. However, pregnant women need to be extra cautious because contracting measles can cause congenital defects in an unborn baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Testing for measles immunity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone uncertain whether they have immunity to measles can take a blood test (also called a titer test) to measure antibodies against measles in your blood. You can get the test at most primary care offices, retail sites like &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/titers-and-immunity-testing"&gt;CVS Minute Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, or your local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test is positive, you have immunity to the disease from a previous vaccination or an infection. Negative test results mean you have no immunity. Diaz says not to rely on the results entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the titer test is positive, you have some immunity, but it doesn’t quantify how much. It doesn’t say you have great or poor immunity, so if it is positive you can take some time, but you probably should still get the booster,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Anne Algie, a Lee County nurse, took the titer test earlier this week. “I will get the results and then make a decision whether I need the booster,” she said. “I will be 70 soon, and while in great health, I do have a few autoimmune diseases and a few other health issues in my history.  I want to be safe for myself and for the others in my community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Bartle, a Miami/Fort Lauderdale medical social worker, is scheduled for a measles titer test on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I received two doses of the vaccine over 30 years ago,” she said. “I’m getting a titer test to be careful. If my antibodies are okay, I won’t get a booster, if they are low I will.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartle said she is nervous about the side effects of a live attenuated vaccine. “But I would rather tough it out through mild symptoms than contract what is one of the most contagious viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says getting another dose is safe, even if you already have some immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk is really close to nothing,” Diaz said. “You may feel achy for a few days or have irritation at the injection site, the same side effects as with any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do have some measles immunity, you are more likely to have a milder illness, and less likely to spread the disease to many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local county health departments can help if you have immunizations recorded in the &lt;a href="https://flshotsusers.com/"&gt;Florida SHOTS&lt;/a&gt; system, which tracks immunization records for vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The symptoms of measles&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can spread quickly. On average, one infected person may infect about &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/28/measles-outbreak/"&gt;15 other people&lt;/a&gt;, according to Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease infects the respiratory tract before spreading throughout the body. Diaz said the symptoms come on 10 to 14 days after exposure. “It starts with typical viral stuff — cough, sore throat, runny nose. Then the rash appears along with red, itchy eyes known as conjunctivitis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the vaccine, it takes about two weeks to get the full benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all need to pay attention to the outbreaks and keep close surveillance,” Diaz said. “It still can get out of hand because it’s very contagious. You will need to decide when you need a booster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,  Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Fox News this week: “I’m a freedom-of-choice person” regarding vaccines. He also said the government is providing vitamin A to the measles outbreak-impacted areas in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say children with measles are at an increased risk of vitamin A deficiency and supplementation might reduce death, adding that the better choice is to prevent measles from happening in the first place through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun Sentinel health reporter Cindy Goodman can be reached at cgoodman@sunsentinel.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second story in a two-part series that looks back on the impact of Covid-19 in Vermont after five years. The first story, &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/03/14/new-technology-and-mistrust-is-legacy-of-covid-19-for-vermont-public-health/"&gt;“New technology, and mistrust, is legacy of Covid-19 for Vermont public health,” can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patsy Kelso, Vermont’s state epidemiologist, remembers hearing about Covid-19 for the first time through the “routine channels.” The Centers for Disease Control and other public health entities regularly share information about emerging infectious diseases, from mpox virus circulating worldwide to Ebola outbreaks in Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was nothing, at first, that suggested Covid would be the one to shut down the world. “It did take me by surprise, personally, how quickly things ramped up,” Kelso said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of Covid within the United States was so misunderstood that the focus of many experts was on preventing transmission from international travelers. In reality, the virus had been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=January%2030%2C%202020,of%20cases%20up%20to%20seven."&gt;spreading nationwide for months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont officials recommended hand washing and staying home when sick, but masking and social distancing were not yet on the horizon for the general public. In fact, only three days after Vermont’s first Covid case on March 7, 2020, hundreds of people attended a University of Vermont basketball game. At least &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/06/18/uvm-basketball-game-was-a-major-spreading-event-vtdigger-survey-finds/"&gt;20 confirmed Covid cases&lt;/a&gt; were later linked to the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the situation was quick to change. On March 15, 2020, Gov. Phil Scott ordered &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/03/15/scott-orders-schools-to-close/"&gt;K-12 schools to shut down&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Covid’s spread. A flurry of other closures followed, until Scott issued a blanket order on March 24: &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/03/24/stay-home-scott-orders-in-response-to-covid-19-outbreak-in-vermont/"&gt;“Stay home” and “stay safe.” &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid tracing in the state began with a whiteboard in Kelso’s office listing individual Vermonters’ initials and their test results. Then she had to bring in a second whiteboard. Then the entire office was sent home, and the department was forced to rapidly come up with a system for tracking hundreds of people and tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the testing side, Helen Reid, then director of health surveillance at the Vermont Department of Health, was scrambling to scale up Covid laboratory testing. Early shortages of basic testing equipment — pipette tips, plastic — hampered their progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was hard to anticipate the scale that this would go to,” said Reid, who now heads the department's infectious disease division. “So with every new piece of information, we were sort of pivoting and adjusting our approach, and doing it pretty quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with supplies, the department was in desperate need of more staff. Officials put out a call early on for “basically anyone in state government who had a microbiology degree,” Reid said. Still, she recalled working extremely long hours in the early weeks of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went from, I think it was, testing about 56 specimens a day in the early days of Covid, to our team testing 1,500 per day by the end of May, because we didn't really have a choice at that point,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the health department scrambled, state officials tallied the numbers. &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/04/02/state-models-shows-covid-19-caseload-peaking-in-mid-april-under-likely-scenario/"&gt;Early Covid press conferences&lt;/a&gt; featured charts of hospital capacity and the amount of need under “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. In those early months of the pandemic, Vermont did not come close to hitting its hospital capacity. In fact, cases ebbed into the spring and summer months, and the state reported zero deaths for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Sosin, a health equity researcher and lecturer at Dartmouth College, recalled Vermonters in that time beginning to talk about the state as an &lt;a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/programs/2021-01-21/it-was-a-pandemic-escape-community-in-1918-and-now"&gt;“escape community,”&lt;/a&gt; protected from Covid by its relative isolation and rurality. But she said she had reason to be skeptical since her research in health equity suggested rural areas can be uniquely vulnerable to illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people think about disease risk as “distances between houses and physical infrastructure,” but rural communities often have tight-knit bonds and anchor institutions like schools and employers that bring them together, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural areas also have more essential workers and fewer hospital beds and other health infrastructure. Yet she was sympathetic to those who wanted to return to their pre-pandemic lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of us want to alter our daily lives for months or years on end,” Sosin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccine goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination campaign in 2021 marked a new stage in the pandemic. After rolling out the vaccine to older and high-risk Vermonters, Scott announced that May a benchmark-based plan to reopen Vermont: If &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/05/21/scott-ill-lift-all-covid-restrictions-when-80-are-vaccinated/"&gt;80% of Vermonters get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, he said, he would lift major Covid restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Admittedly, this would be an ambitious goal for most,” he said at a press conference announcing the initiative. “And to be honest, most states won’t come close to reaching it. But I believe Vermont can show the country how it’s done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 14, 2021, &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/06/14/vermont-reopens-scott-lifts-restrictions-as-state-reaches-80-vaccination-goal/"&gt;the state hit that goal&lt;/a&gt;, and Scott followed through on his promise. Once again, Vermonters enjoyed a summer light on Covid limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont remains close to the top of the nation in its initial Covid vaccination rate, tied with three other states, &lt;a href="http://usafacts.org"&gt;according to USAfacts.org&lt;/a&gt;. Kelso praised the policy, saying that it helped limit deaths later in the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that was a strong policy that resulted in both large uptake of the vaccine, and also quickly, because Vermonters wanted things to reopen,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once again, the Covid ease was not to last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That summer, the more severe and infectious &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/13/what-vermonters-need-to-know-about-the-delta-variant/"&gt;Delta variant&lt;/a&gt; began circulating through Vermont. Cases and deaths surged in the fall. Then Omicron hit. The less severe, but extremely contagious, variant spread quickly nationwide. In Vermont, reported hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/01/14/vermont-reports-100-people-hospitalized-for-covid-and-2300-new-cases/"&gt;topped the state’s hospital bed capacity&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to take &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/02/04/did-vermont-hospitals-get-overwhelmed-during-omicron-surge/"&gt;emergency staffing measures&lt;/a&gt; for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott pushed forward with reopening despite the rise. Just as Omicron began to wane, he announced the &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/02/18/experts-weigh-scotts-decision-to-end-school-mask-mandate-guidance/"&gt;end of school mask mandates&lt;/a&gt;, citing the need for children to return to normalcy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Sosin remains critical of this policy. She said the state leadership early in the pandemic was “fast and effective,” but “lost discipline in responding to the pandemic in later stages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-light-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-3 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c0213cbd22f6b8fbb5ef50a67f12df73"&gt;READ MORE&lt;/h5&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She argues that masking, tied with other Covid-concious policies, actually helped to keep schools open during the worst of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of us thought that we should shut the state down the way we did in March 2020,” she said. “We knew a lot more and had many more tools to respond to the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelso took a more positive view of the state’s response, but said the restrictions and regulations were a balance that had trade offs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statewide and public health policies in Vermont contributed to the state having the lowest death rate in the nation, she said, but there were downsides to some of them as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Limiting visitation in long-term care facilities, for example, really helped reduce introduction of the virus into a facility where it could then spread quickly and result in terrible outcomes, but that also had devastating impacts on individuals’ lives,” Kelso said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont might have had a comparatively low death rate, but that’s not how Sosin thinks when evaluating the state’s performance. “I never think about it in terms of Vermont versus Texas. I think about it in terms of lives that didn't need to be lost,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always think we measure this on our own terms, and we would not resort to lowest-common-denominator metrics in thinking about public health, or the preservation of human life,” Sosin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story was wrong about the current job title of a public health official with the Vermont Department of Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

Included in each study were participants who were free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butter intake was considered through cooking with butter or adding butter to food during meals, and plant-based oil alternatives were olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, and safflower oil. During up to 33 years of follow-up, participants were given food intake questionnaires at baseline and every four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers observed that substituting 10 grams of butter a day with an equal amount of plant-based oil was associated with an estimated 17% reduction in overall mortality and a 17% reduction in cancer mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Butter is high in saturated fat and calories, making it a less healthy option than other dairy products like milk, cheese, or yogurt,” Chen said. “It is this saturated fat that increases someone’s risk of developing heart disease, particularly through increasing ‘bad’ cholesterol levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David Cutler, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, who was also not involved in the study, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that not all fats are created equal — some are beneficial to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to remember that it is essential to have some fat or oil (liquid fat) in our diets. We ingest these substances as fatty acids and then transport them in our blood stream as triglycerides,” Cutler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fatty acids are necessary components of many cells in our bodies, circulating chemicals and important hormones. There are also certain fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) which require fats in our diets to be absorbed. While our bodies can manufacture many of the fatty acids necessary for survival, there are two ‘essential’ fatty acids which we cannot manufacture and must be included in our diets,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing fats in their most unprocessed form — and prioritizing those with benefits to metabolism and long-term health — is the most important aspect to consider when thinking about good sources, &lt;a href="https://www.melaniemurphyrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Melanie Murphy Richter&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, a nutritionist and founder of Wholistic Ritual, who also was not involved with the study, told &lt;em&gt;MNT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a functional nutrition standpoint, fats are not just a source of energy but essential for cellular repair, hormone production, brain function, and inflammation regulation. Whole-food sources of fat offer the greatest benefits because they come with additional nutrients that support the body’s ability to process and utilize fats efficiently,” Richter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter provided a list of sources for good fats, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/strong&gt; – Almonds, walnuts, flax, chia, and hemp seeds provide omega-3s, fiber, and plant-based protein, which help balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avocados&lt;/strong&gt; – A rich source of monounsaturated fats, potassium, and fiber that supports heart health, insulin sensitivity, and satiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil&lt;/strong&gt; – High in polyphenols and monounsaturated fats, olive oil is known for its ability to combat oxidative stress and support vascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt; – Wild salmon, sardines, and mackerel provide long-chain omega-3s (EPA and DHA), which are critical for brain function, reducing inflammation, and maintaining metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grass-fed butter and ghee&lt;/strong&gt; – These contain fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K2, along with butyrate, which supports gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut and MCT oil&lt;/strong&gt; – These oils contain medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are rapidly converted into energy rather than stored as fat, making them beneficial for brain function and metabolic support when used in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; should also be part of the calculus when picking butter substitutes or healthy sources of fat. Cutler explained that omega-3 fatty acids, which include the essential alpha linolenic acid, can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, therefore, cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vegetable oils which are high in omega-3 fatty acids are flaxseed and walnut oil. Fish oil is another source of omega-3 fatty acids which tend to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease,” Cutler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega-6 fatty acids, like the essential linoleic acid, are prevalent in corn and soybean oil, and these have limited conversion to EPA and DHA.” So, while research on the effects of these oils on heart health remains mixed, Cutler suggests they do not lower LDL cholesterol or reduce cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Grass-fed butter&lt;/a&gt;, which comes from cows that eat primarily grass, is seen as a much healthier version of butter. It contains more nutrients, such as the natural fatty acid conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been noted for its potential positive effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248423.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and immune function. But, as with most aspects of dietary health, balance is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A small amount of butter consumed in moderation can still be part of a well-balanced diet,” Dr. Chen said. “Grass-fed butter (butter from grass-fed cows) is thought to be a healthier option than regular butter, as it contains lower levels of saturated fat and higher levels of unsaturated fat and Vitamin A.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter agreed, pointing to how butter’s effects on health depend on someone’s overall diet and their metabolic response, but noting that grass-fed is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grass-fed vs. regular butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grass-fed butter has a significantly different nutrient profile than conventional butter, providing higher levels of omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and vitamin K2, which support heart health, immune function, and metabolic balance. It also contains butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that supports gut barrier integrity and inflammation regulation. Conventional butter, typically from grain-fed cows, is lower in these nourishing nutrients and is also higher in omega-6 fatty acids, which can contribute to inflammation.”&lt;br&gt;— Melanie Murphy Richter, MS, RDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:29:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQUmp4dDQzYWZHaklsaER3N0hpVmthX2I3amJSMHp5MFBSUnA0aVpxTUZ3NWhCaGU4QTg5V2pMY1VKSnlVYUR0eGJrTzJ1NXl3RlJNOG5yOUJQNTNpbTRyUDZqeU93elgxTVVlTXAydkk0dlVvQkhrU3hKbXZSYzAzcGxWSDZEa1dKbWpoaTV0NkE1VURQRU5sLUxn</guid></item><item><title>What Minnesotans need to know about bird flu risks - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1Ra1lNWUNIT0pfUlZreTBDTlo0UkdITzRmVEE2d0QzTVk5aTVfM3ZBaGE4Z2RDbElzSFBfY2J5cVZvTFItY2luMU5RdlVwRkR1cmxRMjI5VzJXd2NIMUgwU3hqTnZGb2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The CDC says the virus remains a low public health risk for the general population.

                                Tracy Robert, a personal trainer and nutrition coach, was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40.

                      &lt;p&gt;She said she wishes doctors took her "symptoms and concerns seriously." She believes if they had screened her for colon cancer sooner, they might have caught it before it reached stage 2B-3A. By the time Robert was diagnosed, she needed to have part of her large intestine removed and replaced by a colostomy bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert's story is not uncommon. More people under the age of 45 are being &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;diagnosed with colon cancer.&lt;/a&gt; Doctors in the US recommend people start getting colon cancer screenings at 45. In Canada, doctors recommend that screening begin at 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms that might warrant earlier testing can be easily overlooked. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Common signs of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, such as constipation or diarrhea, can also be caused by gastrointestinal-related issues like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/what-is-celiac-disease" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/gluten-intolerance-symptoms" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gluten intolerance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Shannin Desroches, a 27-year-old from Ontario, Canada, who buckled in pain after every meal. She planned to get bloodwork to check for celiac disease, but her symptoms became so severe she checked into urgent care. Tests revealed multiple tumors throughout her body. At 26, she had stage 4 colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;For doctors, it's a tricky tightrope to walk when they're diagnosing young patients. About &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://gastro.org/press-releases/new-survey-finds-forty-percent-of-americans-daily-lives-are-disrupted-by-digestive-troubles/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;45% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; have digestive issues, many of which have crossover symptoms with colon cancer. Because &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.health.com/money/colonoscopy-costs" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;colonoscopies cost around $2,000&lt;/a&gt; on average, doctors typically won't urge young patients to get one without &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-had-my-first-colonoscopy-in-my-twenties-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;serious symptoms&lt;/a&gt; or a family history of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-colon-cancer-on-the-rise-reasons-why-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer rates&lt;/a&gt; continue to rise worldwide, spotting the symptoms early can make a huge difference in how patients are treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="108877b9-7c88-4ba0-9e5c-d7959e771622" data-toc-id="108877b9-7c88-4ba0-9e5c-d7959e771622"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early colon cancer symptoms can be mild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;common colon cancer symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in people under 50 include abdominal pain, altered bowel movements, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea. In many cases, like Desroches', severe symptoms don't show up until later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where the tumor is, those symptoms might be very mild at first, Dr. David Richards, a gastroenterologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tumor grows in the center of the colon, it might go undetected or produce mild discomfort. "It hasn't yet gotten big enough or invaded into adjacent structures enough to start really causing symptoms," Richards told BI. On the surface, it might look like a gluten allergy or gastrointestinal issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="08b4f6d6-9f2e-4557-81de-435dc5405362" data-toc-id="08b4f6d6-9f2e-4557-81de-435dc5405362"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary changes can temporarily improve cancer symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with GI disorders are often advised to make dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches tried to offset her symptoms by eating smaller snacks, but her stools remained thin and she had constant pain in her abdomen. Robert, who was diagnosed with IBS at 20, remembers being told to "eat more fiber."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, diet tweaks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;can temporarily reduce symptoms of colon cancer, creating "a false-positive response to diet change," Dr. Mohammed Najeeb Al Hallak, an oncologist specializing in GI malignancies at the Karmanos Cancer Institute, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, following a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/gluten-free-diet" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gluten-free diet&lt;/a&gt; to treat celiac&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;disease can make stools firmer by reducing inflammation in the small intestine. Less inflammation can also lessen colon cancer symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person has colon cancer, he said these positive changes are temporary — and may&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;delay the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="69e0dc9c-601e-4b88-98c6-19ebaa937e5f" data-toc-id="69e0dc9c-601e-4b88-98c6-19ebaa937e5f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to spot the difference between colon cancer and digestive issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical community is still debating the best age to start annual screenings. Based on rising colon cancer rates, US screening guidelines were changed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/when-to-get-first-colonoscopy-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;from age 50 to 45&lt;/a&gt;. "Some people argued about lowering it even more because we've been seeing colon cancer popping up more often in younger populations," Richards said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're under 45, there are some "alarm symptoms" to look out for. Anemia, bright red or black stools, unexplained weight loss, trouble swallowing, and fever are all signs to take your symptoms more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Hallak said to always get a second opinion if you feel dismissed by your doctor. For example, celiac&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;disease requires a biopsy and blood tests to confirm the diagnosis — never accept "it's probably celiac" without those tests. See someone who takes your pain seriously, especially if the symptoms don't improve.&lt;/p&gt;

This can leave people extremely susceptible to other pathogens for weeks after an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The virus also attacks the immune system’s memory cells. These cells remember and recognize the pathogens you’ve encountered over the course of your life and protect against them, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has studied measles and immunity. Scientists call the phenomenon “immune amnesia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Everyone who gets sick from measles will experience some level of immune amnesia, Dr. Mina said. This happens on a spectrum. For some people, it might mean that coming down with the flu will keep them in bed for an extra day or two, he said. But others may lose far more immunity and wind up getting seriously sick from the viruses they encounter. This immune amnesia can last for around three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“A real concern is you’re not just going to get measles and get sick, but within the next couple of years, your kid’s going to be really vulnerable to a lot of other stuff,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can also cause severe, long-term complications. About one in 1,000 children who develop measles will experience brain swelling, which can cause hearing and vision loss, intellectual disabilities and permanent brain damage. And people of any age &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/10/well/immunocompromised-disease.html" title=""&gt;who are immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt; are at greater risk for developing a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/114/5/e657/67706/A-New-Complication-of-Stem-Cell-Transplantation?redirectedFrom=PDF" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;specific type of brain swelling&lt;/a&gt; that can occur for up to a year after they recover, said Dr. Milstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, the newly minted health and human services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The families that I touch base with in Gaines County — they are fearful and concerned,” said Dr. Montanez, who practices at Texas Tech University Health Science Center.

&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles has been spreading&lt;/a&gt; across America, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 220 cases nationwide as of March 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The uptick in cases began with an outbreak in Texas, where there have been 223 cases identified since late January (as of March 11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new case was confirmed in a Howard County, Maryland, resident last week after the individual traveled internationally through Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/us-measles-outbreak-see-states-where-cases-have-been-reported" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. MEASLES OUTBREAK: SEE THE STATES WHERE CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials claimed that this case is not related to the Texas outbreak, warning travelers to be on the lookout for measles symptoms if they &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traveled through the airport&lt;/a&gt; around that same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and is most threatening to unvaccinated individuals, Fox News' senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel previously told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WedMD CMO Dr. John Whyte (not pictured) recommended that travelers wear masks, wash their hands and stay aware of their surroundings amid measles outbreaks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a 90% chance you will get it if you are unvaccinated and step into a room where someone with measles was two hours before," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/maryland-confirms-first-measles-case-traveler-major-dc-airport" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARYLAND CONFIRMS FIRST MEASLES CASE IN TRAVELER AT MAJOR DC AIRPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When traveling in a confined space, such as an airplane, exposure becomes even more of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital in New York City, Dr. John Whyte, WebMD chief medical officer and practicing physician, emphasized how measles is "one of the most contagious &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;respiratory viruses&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of this article.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"The good news is, if you're immunized, you're unlikely to be affected."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is much more contagious than COVID," he said. "It’s a factor of several times more contagious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One infected person can impact about 10 to 15 other people, according to Whyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to protect yourself &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;from infection&lt;/a&gt; while traveling and flying, the doctor said, including being aware of your surroundings and wearing a mask in areas where cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When traveling in a confined space, such as an airplane, exposure becomes even more of a concern.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor also recommended "good handwashing" after touching surfaces, as well as keeping surfaces clean, since &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/viruses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;virus droplets&lt;/a&gt; can stick and spread when contact is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have been infected with measles often do not become symptomatic until four days after exposure, Whyte shared, so it may be difficult to track the origin of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/florida-alerts-first-measles-case-public-school-experts-stress-vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FLORIDA ALERTS FIRST MEASLES CASE OF YEAR IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AS EXPERTS STRESS VACCINATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte mentioned that the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is "very effective," although some people have chosen not to be vaccinated, which is "where we’re seeing those cases," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the MMR vaccine is most commonly administered to children, some adults might not remember if they received it and may be concerned about the strength of their immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A booster for the MMR vaccine is available for people who lack immunity, Whyte noted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte suggested receiving a measles titer, which is a blood test that measures antibody (immunity) levels against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for people who are &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/travel-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traveling to other countries&lt;/a&gt;, where exposure risk may be higher, the doctor added. For those lacking immunity, MMR vaccine boosters are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd say if you're starting to see measles in your area, and you're concerned about whether or not you have immunity, go to your doctor and get your titers checked," he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Otherwise, practice all those good hygiene methods that we talked about. Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Be aware of your surroundings. Clean surfaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles cases are mostly occurring in unvaccinated, school-aged children, the data shows.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are feeling sick, Whyte encouraged staying home and abstaining from traveling to help &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;keep others healthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically begin with coughing and sneezing, and then lead to a red rash on the face and body several days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of physicians [have] never seen measles," Whyte noted. "So, you have to sometimes prompt your doctor if you think you might have been exposed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious complications, the doctor warned, including brain swelling and pneumonia, particularly in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;older individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is, if you're immunized, you're unlikely to be affected, even if you come into contact with someone who does have measles," Whyte said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the whole beauty of immunization."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNdU81a2UybWpiSGI2Y28wVDNhNlllUDZYYmp2NGdRb1hnLVlVN3R0RFNLbDhMRkE0SFJnX2VwdEdTSi1TakVoQ3ZyaUNmNHpLcnVZN3ZGZ2xfeU81Tm5OQnZQQTRYeVVSWWxKS3hHS3NyYWVLeHVEa3RnMVJGV2dlS2FuTW5tQ03SAYwBQVVfeXFMTm1NNnRRazVfNkZ6NTh4MDA0TVJpei1ibGZfd0FqVnJrcUZ4V1FoTkIwTTd2QlBhaTF2aVFiRW9mN0NvemFtdGRUMTQtejZKYkQ5cU4xbGlCVDlxclh6UTNrT3hZRGM2Q3JSZjZGd1gzclo4SGxZZjd3Y1NFUUR6dGd5aFBkZmJOWkJ6cDM</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. says measles vaccine routinely causes deaths.

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-jr-confirmed-hhs-secretary-vote-vaccine-critic-to-top-trump-health-official/"&gt;was confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as America’s secretary of health and human services, neutral observers might have asked themselves: Would it be possible for a lawyer who had questioned the safety of childhood vaccinations for two decades to look at the available data and reconsider his views?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s recent interviews with Fox News, along with an op-ed he published on that outlet’s website, have been enough to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;make many experts conclude the answer is “no.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parsing every claim about the measles vaccine that Kennedy has made would take a long time, so let’s focus on one: that the vaccine causes deaths every year. Researchers say that simply isn’t true, except potentially in a small number of people who are not supposed to receive it — those with compromised immune systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There are adverse events from the vaccine,” Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;March 11 interview &lt;/a&gt;with Fox’s Sean Hannity. “It does cause deaths every year. It causes — it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Infectious Disease Society of America says&lt;/a&gt; there have been “no deaths related to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in healthy individuals.” (Since the 1970s, the measles vaccine has been given in a combination shot with mumps and rubella to minimize the number of injections kids get.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine has never been found to cause a death in an immunocompetent individual,” Daniel Griffin, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Island Infectious Disease Medical in New York said, echoing that conclusion. “If you’ve got someone who has a compromised immune system, and someone doesn’t know any better and gives them an active vaccine, which is what you are not supposed to do, then, you know, that could result in a death.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is itself a killer. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, it was a near-certainty that children would be infected before the age of 15 — about three or four million cases occurred every year. Most children had no complications, but a little more than 1 in 1,000 would die after developing pneumonia or encephalitis. That equates to 400 or 500 deaths a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00850-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; 2024 study in the The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;estimated that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;measles vaccines prevented 93.7 million deaths globally between 1974 and 2024 — a number equivalent to a quarter of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles isn’t a huge threat now. Public health experts worry that won’t remain the case because of low vaccination rates. Importantly, even though the measles vaccine is one of the most effective on the market, it will not protect every person vaccinated. Perhaps one person in 20, maybe less, will not have fully protective antibody levels. Having more unvaccinated people means more risk for everyone, including people with compromised immune systems and children too young to receive the shot. (Children are eligible for the shot at 1 year of age.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All medical products come with risks. The measles vaccine includes a weakened virus, which means that scientists developed it by passing a measles virus through cell cultures and chicken embryos until it became less able to cause serious symptoms in people, but still able to spur immunity. It is, essentially, measles with dramatically less risk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shot still commonly causes a fever. Seizures caused by fever occur in 3 in 10,000 people who receive the shot. Clotting issues occur in roughly 3 in 100,000. Allergic reactions occur in perhaps 3 in a million. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; are even rarer than that. As Kennedy noted, the vaccine can cause encephalitis, although case counts appear vanishingly rare. There are also scattered case reports of patients developing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3589229/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20optic%20neuritis%20is,to%20non%2Dviral%20vaccine%20components." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that can cause blindness, but in most of these patients sight returned with time or treatment. Those cases are so rare it is difficult to even estimate the risk of them occurring — except to say that it is very, very low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy’s assertion that the vaccine causes deaths every year likely comes from reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a government-run database that allows individuals or their doctors to submit reports of bad outcomes they think were caused by a vaccine. It is an important early warning system for vaccine side effects, but a flawed one, because there is no way of controlling for the fact that people sometimes think a bad outcome may have been caused by a vaccine when it was not. When there is press coverage of vaccines, reports of side effects tend to go up even though the number of children receiving the vaccines do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236284/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20favors%20acceptance%20of,in%20temporal%20relation%20to%20vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In the mid-1990s,&lt;/a&gt; the Institute of Medicine — now known as the National Academy of Medicine — did a careful review of reports from VAERS. They concluded that except for allergic reactions and blood clot disorders, which were incredibly rare, there was no link between the MMR and deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy’s claim about vaccine deaths came amid a series of other claims about vaccine safety. In one interview, he claimed vaccines are rarely compared with placebos; they usually are. He also made it sound as if measles immunity from the vaccine wanes faster than it does; in fact it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20&amp;amp;%20MMRV%20vaccines%20usually%20protect,common%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;typically lifelong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If, as Kennedy acknowledged, everyone will either get the vaccine or measles, it would seem advisable to get the vaccine, which clearly results in few if any deaths, instead of measles itself, which we know is capable of causing hundreds of deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People should be able to make their own decisions about their children’s vaccinations. But, as Kennedy says, they should have accurate scientific information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

In the August poll, 28% said they thought COVID vaccines had caused thousands of deaths. In June 2021, that number was 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yahoo News spoke to Christopher Whaley, a health economist at Brown University, to help clarify how we should view the effectiveness of the shots and the estimated number of lives they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s really hard to think that President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is anything but that largest public health success in history,” Whaley said. “I think we sometimes lose appreciation for how important and how impactful getting access to vaccines was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whaley has published two studies on the number of lives saved by the COVID vaccines; one of them looked at the impact that the vaccine rollout in December 2020 had on the rate of deaths being recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the United States, we found that COVID vaccines averted nearly 140,000 deaths than would have otherwise happened [over the six months studied] if vaccines were not rolled out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Calculating &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00220-5/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excess mortality figures;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;excess mortality figures&lt;/a&gt;, or the increase in the number of deaths over a given time period versus a comparable period, Whaley then included factors such as the age of a state’s population and how individual states went about distributing the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Alaska, for example, was the first state to reach 20 COVID vaccine doses per 100 adults,’ he said. “Alabama was almost a month later to reach that same threshold in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While studies like Whaley’s are estimates, and figures can vary depending on the data set used by researchers, he stressed that the basic approach is scientifically sound and used to calculate outcomes for a variety of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s not just COVID vaccines or vaccines in general that we use these types of approaches. As researchers we use them across the board in many aspects of health care,” he said. “The same approach is used to look at what are the health effects of Medicaid expansion and getting access to Medicaid coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By Whaley’s calculation, COVID vaccines saved 2.4 million lives in 141 countries, when the threat of death from the virus was at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We know that prior to vaccines, COVID was rampant and was leading to many, many deaths,” he said. “Without vaccines, it’s hard to think about a world in which there would have been such an immediate improvement in health and reductions in mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 08:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQdGxRd2RtLVBoU1R6elBrZExiZHlzQ2VHN19xUHAyZnVzMGhySGhNdUItczZNV2pTd3lZUzN5OFNJM0hVbTVHS1ZoLTZNV1hfZ0g3a3dpR1dlcnZwNUxOZjRta1VPY2ZMemNjeHFRcXN1dFNTTVFuMnprbFYzaWdRaFRlSGxMRkE0c0IwTnBSRmRhWjJLc01iN3hoSXlUQkhRc2J2eHlGVEQ4TzRZdU5acVZYSQ</guid></item><item><title>Pancreatic cancer skin symptoms of disease that 'usually gets spotted too late' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxObmh2bEw4YzBNNHNxMk9ISW12NWd5Y2kxMlNQUkpROERuZl9VcWQ5bnB6MXlwc3U1aWFfUlllbUUweFV0M2lTTmNfc0hPbU1FeGFuSTJiNmVpOEJ4MmljOVpRYkZpeTRGODBuTGF5ZGIyMXFncDVJNW1UOFpmeERUdjZPYmFoaFlReDlxU3d1aUZNZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxOX1ZxY1FSS2FESk00dkp3M3EzRlRUYkhCcVBweFpwY2ZHUlJHSk1EMl9COWszaWpQdGpMdzY1RXFsLUY1cWs1eHJfT3JVUVpoT2J1dEJyYVg3eFQ3UlNXVjdmNFZNcjZ6OUpXZ1liN3EzUk51bzZ5QjZqNW5oOERhSmw5dURQdi1rVTY3dUZwSzNTNmlmRGRJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts have highlighted seven key symptoms of a disease with an alarmingly low survival rate, dubbed as "scary bad" by a top medical university. Despite progress in treatments for various cancers, pancreatic cancer continues to pose a significant challenge, with the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; admitting that it "can be difficult to treat". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early detection is crucial, but the issue with pancreatic cancer is its elusive nature, leading to a survival rate of merely 25% of patients living beyond a year, and a scant 5% surviving 10 or more years post-diagnosis. Cancer Research UK attributes the grim prognosis for pancreatic cancer largely to late diagnosis, with the cancer often being quite advanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only about 10% of patients qualify for surgery to remove the cancer, which provides the best hope for a cure. The pancreas, a small organ nestled behind the stomach and before the spine, plays a critical role in digesting food in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though relatively uncommon, pancreatic cancer ranks among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, trailing lung, colon, and breast cancer. The Medical University of South Carolina has stressed the importance of recognising the seven primary symptoms of pancreatic cancer, which include:.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; People are being warned that jaundice - the yellowing of the skin and eyes - along with light-coloured stools and dark urine, could be symptoms of pancreatic cancer. Other signs to look out for include abdominal or back pain, fatigue, weight loss, and a lack of appetite, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/seven-symptoms-pancreatic-cancer-rarely-30257306" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, apart from the first three symptoms, the others "are not specific indicators that something is wrong and even these are often late signs of disease," according to MUSC Health. "The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is difficult and often late. The symptoms are not terribly specific and this is why the diagnosis is often at an advanced stage."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is hope surrounding a new blood marker (GPC1) that could assist in early detection, but a definitive diagnosis usually requires radiologic studies or a tissue biopsy. People can also take steps to lower their risk of developing pancreatic cancer by leading a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes limiting alcohol consumption to no more than 14 units per week, giving up smoking, reducing intake of processed or red meats, and maintaining a healthy weight, as recommended by NHS guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxObmh2bEw4YzBNNHNxMk9ISW12NWd5Y2kxMlNQUkpROERuZl9VcWQ5bnB6MXlwc3U1aWFfUlllbUUweFV0M2lTTmNfc0hPbU1FeGFuSTJiNmVpOEJ4MmljOVpRYkZpeTRGODBuTGF5ZGIyMXFncDVJNW1UOFpmeERUdjZPYmFoaFlReDlxU3d1aUZNZ9IBlwFBVV95cUxOX1ZxY1FSS2FESk00dkp3M3EzRlRUYkhCcVBweFpwY2ZHUlJHSk1EMl9COWszaWpQdGpMdzY1RXFsLUY1cWs1eHJfT3JVUVpoT2J1dEJyYVg3eFQ3UlNXVjdmNFZNcjZ6OUpXZ1liN3EzUk51bzZ5QjZqNW5oOERhSmw5dURQdi1rVTY3dUZwSzNTNmlmRGRJ</guid></item><item><title>Measles Is Back Across the U.S. What to Know About the Deadly Virus. - Barron's</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE4wUW45M2JSMDIxbUlWYlY3cjFXeDFOYzNUX21UYkRnS0dIRV9fRFFFM0s3QU8yZUVMZWNYM0l6eWZqME0tYk50c0JKalhhWk5CNEhOWDIyckhPdTh0a21IMHhTQlEySHBuMnJnQ0hza1pmcEo4MmRDNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Barron's</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE4wUW45M2JSMDIxbUlWYlY3cjFXeDFOYzNUX21UYkRnS0dIRV9fRFFFM0s3QU8yZUVMZWNYM0l6eWZqME0tYk50c0JKalhhWk5CNEhOWDIyckhPdTh0a21IMHhTQlEySHBuMnJnQ0hza1pmcEo4MmRDNQ</guid></item><item><title>Lamar County in Texas reports 4 confirmed measles cases - The Dallas Morning News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOa0xRUXNkMjVTNldFZmViUVR0dVhTTzJUSWpCeHJuU3dQY1RJRTB6SC1oazNMZWhNWFpLOVd5YWIwa1ZxeWtEM3MyVEFFR2RiY1pPQzIwTmFadWZlOTF0NDJpLTNaSGNYUDJqM0JxMjNuazFQSHNFeE1BYU83UUJ6R2VqLUI4eUJ0T1lEQnMxbkRIbmxBbHFCYmtzUFFHTTdkSXhKREh3b0d4UmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In what could become a spiraling health crisis for &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/03/13/live-track-measles-cases-during-west-texas-outbreak-with-these-graphics/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/03/13/live-track-measles-cases-during-west-texas-outbreak-with-these-graphics/"&gt;the state&lt;/a&gt;, public health officials in Lamar County on Thursday announced four confirmed cases of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Paris-Lamar County Health District officials said the extremely &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/texas-has-an-ongoing-measles-outbreak-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/21/texas-has-an-ongoing-measles-outbreak-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus/"&gt;contagious virus&lt;/a&gt; had been diagnosed in four patients who range in age from 5 months to adulthood.

Even though this is only a short 10-minute workout, I found it easier to concentrate when I went back to my desk and things that I’d been putting off on my to-do list felt more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k3Xn7yruKFS6bCHX32LPT4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-k3Xn7yruKFS6bCHX32LPT4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (or BDNF) is released when walking and this stimulates the growth of new brain cells, which &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041121/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-boosted-my-immune-system-3"&gt;It boosted my immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632669/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632669/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that walking at a brisk pace can boost the number of white blood cells (the body’s natural defense against infection). So if you are looking for a way to improve your immunity, this indoor workout is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I credit regular exercise for keeping me healthy, and it’s rare that I succumb to a cold, or if I do it’s not for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-was-the-active-recovery-session-i-needed-3"&gt;It was the active recovery session I needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After moving from using 8kg to 10kg weights in my strength sessions, this workout served as a great bit of active recovery to help ease my achy muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can ease joint pain by producing synovial fluid to lubricate the joints, and I felt like a lot of the post-workout stiffness and soreness had dissipated by the end of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;

(WSAZ) - The West Virginia Bureau of Public Health believes some West Virginians may have been exposed to measles after a Maryland resident, infected with the illness, landed at the Washington Dulles International Airport on Mar. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say the site of the possible exposure site is in terminal A of the airport, happening on transportation to the main terminal and the baggage claim area between 4-9 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Department of Health officials also say if you were in that area or think you may have been exposed, it’s best to watch for symptoms until Mar. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Department of Health said the first stage of symptoms often result in a fever greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, cough and watery red eyes. Officials said these symptoms can show up seven to 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;After symptoms start, officials said three to five days after that, a rash could appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body. “People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared,” according to a release from the Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Kanawha County Health Officer, Dr. Steven Eshenaur, said measles spreading to several states bordering West Virginia shows just how infectious the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“A room with 10 people, nine out of 10 would likely contract the disease because it is spread so easily through the air. Even after a person leaves a room, measles can be spread for hours potentially later, just from it lingering in the air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Eshenaur said West Virginia has some of the highest immunization rates in the country, and it’s the only way to prevent an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“So, it’s really important not to buy into unscientific data that says that you could treat this disease with vitamin A, when in fact, it does not work for the treatment or prevention of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;He said a change to the current requirement for vaccines would make cases here more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“If we do relax our immunization laws, our population will likely become susceptible to measles outbreaks as we have seen in the other states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Eshenaur said children and pregnant women are at risk of the worst effects when catching measles without protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Measles can cause irreparable damage to an unborn child, so it’s really important that women be protected from contracting measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Eshenaur says the disease is a little too close for comfort and using remedies including cod liver oil, vitamin A and diet changes will not cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WSAZ.
