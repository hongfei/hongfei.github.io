The underarm region no doubt gets the full lather, rinse, repeat treatment. Your feet, by virtue of being located at the end of your body, can be easy to overlook. However, according to some experts, your feet are just as, if not more, deserving of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Both the UK's National Health Service (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/smelly-feet/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;) and US &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/foot-hygiene.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Centre for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, for example, advise washing feet daily with soap and water. One reason for this meticulous care is to prevent odour. The soles of the foot contain &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150730-the-disgusting-secrets-of-smelly-feet." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;600 sweat glands&lt;/a&gt; per square centimetre of skin, more than any other region of the body.  Although sweat itself doesn't smell, it contains a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2019.1632145#d1e150" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;nutritious broth&lt;/a&gt; of salts, glucose, vitamins and amino acids, which serves as an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/spectrum.04180-22" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;all-you-can-eat buffet&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria that live there. And there a lot of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The foot – especially between the toes – is quite a moist, humid, and warm environment, so it can be a breeding ground for microbes," says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull in the UK. This is exacerbated by the fact that most people encase their feet in socks and shoes, trapping the moisture inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you zoom in on any square centimetre of human skin you will find between 10,000 to one million bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2493393/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;living there.&lt;/a&gt; Warm and moist areas of the skin, such as the feet, are considered prime real estate and are home to the greatest numbers of species. Feet are idyllic havens for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19478181/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="corynebacterium" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Corynebacterium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for example.

In fact, the human foot contains &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12171" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a greater biodiversity of fungal species&lt;/a&gt; than any other body region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is probably a good reason to clean your feet. In one study, researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3503" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;swabbed the soles&lt;/a&gt; of 40 volunteers. They found that foot washing had a significant impact on bacteria numbers. People who washed their feet twice a day had around 8,800 bacteria living in each square centimetre of skin. Those who reported washing every other day had over one million bacteria per square centimetre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However just because the soles of your feet are brimming with microbial life, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily smelly or that there is anything to worry about. As always, it's not just the number, but the type of bacteria that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;The human foot contains a greater biodiversity of fungal species than any other body region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; are the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Harker/publication/271213529_Spatial_variations_in_the_microbial_community_structure_and_diversity_of_the_human_foot_is_associated_with_the_production_of_odorous_volatiles/links/5657182e08aeafc2aac0bad5/Spatial-variations-in-the-microbial-community-structure-and-diversity-of-the-human-foot-is-associated-with-the-production-of-odorous-volatiles.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;key players&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to producing the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) responsible for foot odour. Sweat glands on the skin of the feet release a heady mix of electrolytes, amino acids, urea and lactic acid. The &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus &lt;/i&gt;bacteria consider this a veritable feast and, in the process of feeding, convert amino acids into VFAs. The main chemical culprit is isovaleric acid, which has an unpleasant odour which has been described as having a "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ffj.3136" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;distinct cheesy/acidic note"&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison is apt, as many cheeses contain a similar &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218302984" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;mix of volatile chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In one &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Harker/publication/271213529_Spatial_variations_in_the_microbial_community_structure_and_diversity_of_the_human_foot_is_associated_with_the_production_of_odorous_volatiles/links/5657182e08aeafc2aac0bad5/Spatial-variations-in-the-microbial-community-structure-and-diversity-of-the-human-foot-is-associated-with-the-production-of-odorous-volatiles.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;2014 study,&lt;/a&gt; researchers swabbed the feet of 16 subjects and found that 98.6% of the bacteria present on the soles of the feet were &lt;i id="staphylococci" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococci&lt;/i&gt;. The levels of VFAs, including the key foot odour compound isovaleric acid, were also significantly increased on the sole of the foot compared to the bridge (top) of the foot. Overall, the study concluded that the intensity of foot malodour was correlated to the total number of &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; present – another reason to reach for the soap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, washing your feet isn't just about preventing cheesy foot odour. Many diseases and foot problems can be prevented through good foot hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Because of the small space between the toes, these areas are particularly at risk for microbial infections," says Joshua Zeichner, associate professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. "This can lead to itching, swelling, and a foul smell. As the skin barrier becomes disrupted, this can also increase the risk of microorganisms invading the skin and causing more significant soft tissue infections known as cellulitis," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to Zeichner, the most common problem is the development of athlete's foot, which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin on the feet. The fungi that cause athlete's foot&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/athletes-foot" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt; thrive in warm, dark, and moist environments&lt;/a&gt; – hence why this condition most commonly affects the spaces in-between the toes. Keep this area clean and dry and you deprive the fungi of their perfect home. This is a good thing, as athlete's foot can cause a series of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/athletes-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353841" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;unpleasant symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as itchiness, a scaly rash, flaky skin and cracking on the soles of your feet and between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo/BBC Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Keeping your feet clean could also prevent skin infections, such as those caused by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14787210.2015.1023291" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i id="pseudomonas" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. While these bacteria exist naturally on your skin, if they get into your bloodstream via a cut then it can lead to a serious infection. Even a minor staph infection can lead to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/staph-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20356221" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;boils&lt;/a&gt; – bumps of pus that form under the skin around hair follicles or oil glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The feet are more prone to infections because there's quite a lot of biomass of bacteria there, and also if you do have cracks or injuries to your feet, it tends to heal much more slowly than other areas of the body," says Wilkinson. "In a situation like that, there's a greater chance that if you have an injury, pathogens could get into that wound, populate and overgrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While skin infections can still occur if you have good foot hygiene, regularly washing your feet reduces the number of bacteria present. So, if you happen to get a cut, there will be less microbes around to get into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They are there waiting for an opportunity to cause an infection. So, it's really important that people with diabetes are keeping on top of their foot hygiene, because they're at more risk of developing infection because of that," says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To make matters worse, people with diabetes also have an impaired immune response, so if they do get an infection, their body can't fight it off. Diabetes patients are also prone to cuts, wounds, and sores in the feet that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67700-8/abstract" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;don't heal&lt;/a&gt;. If these aren't caught early, then toes, feet, or even limbs may need to be amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If you have uncontrolled diabetes, you may have damage to the nerves in your feet, so you can't feel your feet properly," says Wilkinson. "Just the act of washing allows you to properly check your feet for any minor abrasions or dryness that might contribute to having an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – Holly Wilkinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But what about everyone else? Some experts argue that for most people, washing the feet every day has little health benefit, and can even raise the risk of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/2631732/pdf/11294712.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;skin problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Overwashing the skin can disrupt the skin barrier, stripping the skin of natural oils, contributing to dryness and inflammation," says Zeichner. This leads to itchy, dry skin and can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eczema-from-overwashing-hands#overwashing-hands-and-eczema" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;exacerbate conditions like eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It is also important not to overly scrub or exfoliate the skin on the feet," says Zeichner. "Calluses develop because of daily trauma. But they actually protect the feet from the environment. Removing calluses takes away that protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There is also a concern that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-antibacterial-products-with-triclosan-fueling-bacterial-resistance-2019080617473" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;antibacterial soaps&lt;/a&gt; could upset the delicate balance of microorganisms on the skin, killing the beneficial species and allowing the emergence of hardier, pathogenic strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Finally, our immune system needs to be challenged to a certain extent by microbes in order to do its job.

The answer depends to some extent on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For people with diabetes, it is 100% advised that you wash your feet every day," says Wilkinson. "But if you don't have any underlying conditions, then dermatologists tend to advise that every couple of days is more than enough to maintain good hygiene, without stripping too much of the natural oils on your skin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, Wilkinson points out that if you're somebody likes to run or work out at the gym, then you will obviously need to wash your feet more regularly than somebody who is less active. It's also not just the frequency of washing that's important either. How you wash and dry your feet also has health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – you need to actually physically wash your feet with soapy water," says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, according to Dan Baumgardt, a GP and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol in the UK, the most important thing he stresses to patients is to make sure you dry your feet properly. "When you've got wetness or dampness in between the toes that's allowed to just remain there in a warm environment, that's when you're prone to developing things like athlete's foot and other fungal infections," says Baumgardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQazFQajFYcmxJaWhwUV9aaUh3YXc4VjRSYmhRMllXXzU3cTJUWFozUk9QaUNzV0NRcW5Nd1drczR4RElUMzBvbzYweE51bGt5WWIzNW9lVkRETV9UOFF0aXh6TEItV2pmVm9FbkFnME5qVFZOQ1J6WVRfMEkzMW8zcmx3NkZCdw</guid></item><item><title>TikTok is full of ADHD advice — just don't trust it for a diagnosis - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBvcFBmS2ltZkdweHV4SGMxUFU0RjhtTVdWVkZUa3dYVmlxb0ZjU2hfX2VSdm5FQm40VzJjb0haQXpKczFwRXFibHFIQzNXRGxNVU5Hd3BEdF9TR3BWZHo0RFVNV3l2RVJLQkZjWm14NDYzaU5yTk5fdGxzYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                TikTok videos on ADHD — attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — are often not backed up by credible sources.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As more Americans suspect they have ADHD — &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; — social media platforms have become go-to spots for sharing symptoms and getting advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's especially true on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the app, popular content on #ADHD and related hashtags have amassed hundreds of millions of views, tapping into humor or themes that feel relatable to many who live with the mental health condition. And therapists say it's undoubtedly helped &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5272801/adhd-research-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" target="_blank"&gt;lead many adults to a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; after years of being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; also carries a warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fewer than half of the claims in the top videos accurately match the scientific criteria that form an ADHD diagnosis. Many oversimplified or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/29/527654633/adult-adhd-cant-be-diagnosed-with-a-simple-screening-test-doctors-warn" target="_blank"&gt;overstated the symptoms of ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, and weren't backed up by reliable sources.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many content creators were also selling something related to ADHD via links in their profiles or posts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And even more concerning: The study suggests a heavy diet of this TikTok content shapes how people perceive ADHD, and not necessarily for the better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People who consumed more also felt worse about their own symptoms," says &lt;a href="https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/vasileia-karasavva/" target="_blank"&gt;Vasileia Karasavva&lt;/a&gt;, the study's author and a postdoctoral student at the University of British Columbia. "They thought they were worse and harder to cope with."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The work expands on &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that has identified the spread of misleading content related to ADHD on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you spend enough time on TikTok, you're going to find hundreds of videos that you could walk away from saying, 'That's me, I think I have ADHD," says &lt;a href="https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/faculty/antshel-phd-kevin-/" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Antshel, a clinical psychologist at Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there's also a growing recognition of ADHD in adults, including many who weren't diagnosed as children. The U.S. has no guidelines specifically for adults with ADHD, and efforts are underway to roll those out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Therapists acknowledge social media is meeting a very real need, especially for people who've been traditionally overlooked. "It's a mixed bag," says &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/maggie-sibley/" target="_blank"&gt;Maggie Sibley&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. "It's a great thing when people who have experiences with ADHD that have been unrecognized for decades finally get the care they need,&lt;em&gt;" she says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What TikTok gets wrong&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, two experienced psychologists ranked the top 100 TikTok videos, which at the time had nearly half a billion views. They gave each a score based on how closely the claims aligned with the&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank"&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, known as the DSM 5.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of them lacked nuance," says Karasavva. "Some of the things they were describing wouldn't apply to all people with ADHD or also could apply to people without ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Next, close to 850 college students were asked to watch and score the five most and least accurate videos as ranked by the clinicians. Then they answered questions about their TikTok habits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who watched more of this content were more likely to recommend these videos, regardless of their accuracy. They also tended to overestimate the prevalence of ADHD as nearly 30%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In reality,&lt;a href="https://caddac.ca/about-adhd/#:~:text=Attention%20Deficit%20Hyperactivity%20Disorder%20(ADHD,the%20country%20has%20the%20disorder." target="_blank"&gt; it's roughly 5% &lt;/a&gt;in Canada, and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/php/adults/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; 6% in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karasavva says their findings raise questions about how TikTok is shaping views of ADHD more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A constant stream of this content could lead people "to become hyper aware of lapses in concentration or small mistakes that we all make," she says. That might explain why people view symptoms as more severe and widespread when they watch more videos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;TikTok meets a need&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's not exactly a mystery why these videos resonate. They can be funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Going through a list of diagnostic symptoms, I imagine that's kind of boring for people to watch," Karasavva says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Sibley, at the University of Washington, recalls how early on some "well-meaning clinicians" tried to get on TikTok with a more conventional approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But who wants to watch them? Nobody," she says, "Social media algorithms like TikTok reward novelty. The tried-and-true science is probably not going to be as popular."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Clinicians who focus on treating ADHD say they regularly encounter the downstream effects of this social media ecosystem that has sprung up around ADHD, when patients show up at their clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They already have a self-diagnosis that's been made based on this content, and arrive at our office telling us they have ADHD," Antshel says. "In fact, quite often now they're telling us the type and the dose of medication they want to treat this."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As he sees it, the major concern is that people end up pursuing unnecessary treatment. For adults under 65 who use stimulants, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;more than a quarter report misuse&lt;/a&gt; — a well-known problem on college campuses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says some of this TikTok content also tends to blur the line between ADHD and symptoms that may actually point to other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Antshel stresses social media is clearly "filling a void" and for some people it can provide answers after struggling for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://health.osu.edu/health/mental-health/survey-adults-and-undiagnosed-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, one in four adults in the U.S suspect they have ADHD. Social media is likely one of many factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;ADHD exists on a spectrum, Sibley says. The average American may have two or three symptoms, but this doesn't mean they have the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"ADHD isn't a temporary response to your environment," she says, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5272801/adhd-research-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" target="_blank"&gt;"It's a largely genetic condition&lt;/a&gt; that you'll see the thread of throughout someone's life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly some concerns, Sibley — who's involved in developing the new ADHD adult guidelines — welcomes the novel ideas coming from places like TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That is just fodder for us," she says,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sibley believes researchers should listen with an open-mind — and then rigorously study what holds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A Florida man in his 70s contracted an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326340/"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt;, life-threatening infection in his &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/defibrillators"&gt;implanted defibrillator&lt;/a&gt; after eating a feral pig in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before cooking and consuming the gift from a local hunter, the man remembers handling the raw meat with bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts suspect it was at this moment that he was unknowingly exposed to a sneaky bacterium, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella_suis"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brucella suis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, the man began experiencing feverish symptoms, intermittent pain, excess fluid, and a hardening of the skin on the left side of his chest, according to a case study, led by infectious disease specialist Jose Rodriguez from the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doctors finally figured out what was going on, the insidious bacterial infection had already slipped into the man's defibrillator, passing through the chest wall, the left subclavian vein, and into the muscular tissue of his left ventricle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safest option was to replace the medical device completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155664" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-642x565.jpg" alt="Defibrillator Infection" class="size-medium wp-image-155664" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-642x565.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-472x415.jpg 472w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-768x676.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-600x528.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155664" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;PET scans showing markers of infection surrounding the cardiac defibrillator generator device. (Rodriguez et al., &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, brucellosis is the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4498663/"&gt;most common bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt; that spreads from animals to humans, and it is usually carried by cows, goats, sheep, and pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections of &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt; and its close relatives are tricky to treat because they can hide inside immune cells for years on end, causing only mild, feverish symptoms that come and go at random. Since the bacteria are hard to isolate and grow in the lab and easily misidentified, as occurred in this case, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1109966616301506"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; don't always pick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defibrillators are a perfect place for &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria to hide. Antibiotics are difficult to deliver to these implants because of their limited blood supply, which means that if infected, taking out the whole device is often the only way to ensure proper treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While severe and life-threatening, a &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; infection of a defibrillator is extremely rare. In a &lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-cardiology.com/article/S0914-5087(12)00241-9/fulltext"&gt;30-year review&lt;/a&gt; of 5,287 patients with a defibrillator, only one patient had a &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; infection requiring complete device and lead removal with antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of unfortunate events led to the Florida man's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2019, long after the man had handled raw pig meat, he began experiencing uncomfortable symptoms on the left side of his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate fellow, who also suffers from type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155615" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart failure, was admitted to the hospital several times that year, where he was treated with a whole host of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His blood cultures revealed an infection with a different bacterium from &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, and an ultrasound of his heart showed his defibrillator had migrated to the left chest wall, just below the nipple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, his symptoms persisted, so the man sought treatment once again at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doctors could find no outward sign of bacteria on his defibrillator's valves or leads, they were concerned by the possibility of an overlooked infection, and so they decided to take the automated implant out of his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab analysis later confirmed the device was contaminated by &lt;i&gt;B. suis&lt;/i&gt;. The previous bacterium was a misidentification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155668" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-642x179.jpg" alt="Bacteria Heart Defibrillator" class="size-medium wp-image-155668" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-642x179.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-768x214.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-600x167.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155668" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood samples showing &lt;em&gt;Brucella suis&lt;/em&gt; infection (pink clumps) in the Florida man.

&lt;p&gt;"In this case, the intermittent use of antibiotics with device retainment likely led to a prolonged clinical course."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six weeks of taking two antibiotics, the man's infection was cleared.The patient was outfitted with a new defibrillator four months after his old one was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, more than three years later, his blood shows no clinical evidence of brucellosis. His story is a cautionary tale to all who partake in eating unpasteurized dairy products or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/zombie-deer-disease-zoonotic-transfer-suspected-after-two-human-deaths"&gt;wild animals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;23rd March 2025 – (Springfield)  A 48-year-old man from Springfield, Missouri, has recounted his unexpected battle with stage four colorectal cancer, initially prompted by a single symptom he chose to ignore. Shawn Michael has shared his experiences in a video that has garnered significant attention on social media, attracting nearly 100,000 views after being featured on The Patient Story’s YouTube channel last month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael’s diagnosis came as a shock to both him and his family, particularly as he had previously been dealing with what he thought was a milder issue. In October of last year, he experienced bowel complications and attributed them to constipation. Despite trying various over-the-counter remedies without success, he sought assistance from an urgent care centre, where he received a powerful treatment that momentarily eased his discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, Michael felt that something was still amiss. He described the immense pain that lingered and returned to urgent care for further examination. A subsequent CT scan revealed a significant mass in his colon, necessitating immediate surgery. Alongside the blockage, doctors discovered additional concerning masses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the operation, surgeons removed a large segment of Michael’s colon and identified several sizeable tumours on his omentum, a layer of fat encasing the colon. Remarkably, the obstruction had not ruptured, a fortunate circumstance that had slowed the spread of cancer to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the surgery was deemed successful and all visible cancer was excised, some remnants remain in his body. Michael is now preparing to undergo three months of chemotherapy, hopeful that the treatment will eradicate the remaining cancerous cells and enable his recovery. Despite the challenges ahead, both he and his medical team remain optimistic given his age and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest analysis to examine the best way to lower levels of "bad" cholesterol in patients with blocked arteries shows that they should immediately be given a combination of a statin and another drug called ezetimibe, rather than statins alone. This could prevent thousands of deaths a year from heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 108,353 patients in 14 studies who were at very high risk of suffering heart attack or stroke, or who had already suffered one of these cardiovascular events is published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows that when ezetimibe was combined with a high dose statin to reduce levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), there was a significant 19% reduction in the risk of death from any cause, a 16% reduction in deaths from cardiovascular causes, and a significant reduction in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events or stroke by 18% and 17% respectively, compared to high doses of statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination therapy also significantly reduced LDL-C levels by an extra 13mg per deciliter (dL) of blood compared to statins alone, measured from the baseline—the time at which the patient first started the treatment. This increased the chances of reaching the ideal goal of less than 70mg/dL of LDL-C by 85%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results were even more pronounced in the network meta-analysis, which enables a direct comparison of different therapy regimens used in the study. This showed a 49% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 39% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, when compared to high-dose statin therapy alone," said first author, Maciej Banach, Professor of Cardiology at the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Poland, and Adjunct Professor at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Banach also leads the International Lipid Expert Panel and the Blood Pressure Meta-analysis Collaboration group that carried out the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The combination therapy is safe and efficacious; the risk of adverse events and the therapy discontinuation rate was comparable between groups. In the network meta-analysis, we showed a significant 44% reduction in the risk of discontinuation in those treated with moderately high-dose statin therapy plus ezetimibe versus a high-dose statin alone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, there have been inconsistent findings about whether or not combined cholesterol-lowering therapy should be given to high-risk patients immediately, even before they suffer a heart attack or stroke, or whether doctors should start these patients on a high-dose statin first and monitor the effects on cholesterol levels after at least two months before deciding if the patients need ezetimibe as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author of the study, Peter Toth, Professor of Clinical Family and Community Medicine, University of Illinois, and Adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, U.S., said, "This study confirms that combined cholesterol-lowering therapy should be considered immediately and should be the gold standard for treatment of very high-risk patients after an acute cardiovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simply adding ezetimibe to statin therapy, without waiting for at least two months to see the effects of statin monotherapy, which is suboptimal in many patients, is associated with more effective LDL-C goal achievement and is responsible for significant incremental reductions in cardiovascular health problems and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"This approach does not require additional funding or reimbursement of new expensive drugs. In fact, it may translate into lower rates of first and subsequent heart attacks and stroke, and their complications like heart failure, which are extremely costly for all health care systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Global Burden of Disease and the American Heart Association, deaths occurring as a result of high LDL-C alone are highest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092509/" target="_blank"&gt;4.5 million deaths worldwide&lt;/a&gt; were attributed to it in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Banach said, "Cardiovascular disease kills around 20 million people a year worldwide. Based on our previous analysis, we estimate that if combination therapy to reduce LDL-C was included in all treatment guidelines and implemented by doctors everywhere for patients with high cholesterol levels, it would prevent over 330,000 deaths a year among patients who have already suffered a heart attack, and almost 50,000 deaths alone in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We recommend &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/combination+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;combination therapy&lt;/a&gt; should be considered the gold standard of treatment for these patients and included in all future treatment guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statins have been used safely for years. They help to lower LDL-C by reducing the production of it by the liver. Ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol that the body takes from food by inhibiting the absorption of it in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Some patients do not respond adequately to statins and are prescribed ezetimibe in combination with a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/statin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;statin&lt;/a&gt;. High doses of statins are known as "high intensity" statins and moderately high doses are known as "moderate intensity" or "medium intensity" statins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Toth said, "Our findings underline the importance of the adages 'the lower for better for longer' but also the equally important 'the earlier the better' for treating patients at high risk of cardiovascular conditions and to avoid further medical complications and deaths."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the study is its large size, as it includes the greatest number of patients studied so far. The patients were included in 14 studies, 11 of which were randomized controlled trials and three were cohort studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations relate mainly to the type of studies that were included in the meta-analysis, including their size and the observational nature of some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(WKBN) — If you’re not getting enough sleep, you may feel tired and groggy, but it can also make you hungrier. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors say sleep deprivation impacts our hormones and may make us eat more the next day. We also tend to crave more unhealthy foods when we’re tired. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctor Nancy Foldvary with the Cleveland Clinic says if you’re having trouble sleeping, it’s important to create a regular nighttime routine and aim to wake up at the same time each day. She also says avoiding an afternoon cup of coffee can help as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="nojq1euy" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine can have a widely variable half-life. It can linger in the central nervous system far beyond what you might expect, and so some of us are really sensitive to that and really can’t have caffeine beyond early morning,” Foldvary said. “Certainly, drinking caffeine or eating foods with caffeine — including chocolate — after noon or 2 p.m. is likely to lead to some sleep fragmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you continue to toss and turn at night, Foldvary recommends seeing a sleep specialist for help and to rule out any underlying sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

We also tend to crave more unhealthy foods when we’re tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctor Nancy Foldvary with the Cleveland Clinic says if you’re having trouble sleeping, it’s important to create a regular nighttime routine and aim to wake up at the same time each day. She also says avoiding an afternoon cup of coffee can help as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Caffeine can have a widely variable half-life. It can linger in the central nervous system far beyond what you might expect, and so some of us are really sensitive to that and really can’t have caffeine beyond early morning,” Foldvary said. “Certainly, drinking caffeine or eating foods with caffeine — including chocolate — after noon or 2 p.m. is likely to lead to some sleep fragmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you continue to toss and turn at night, Foldvary recommends seeing a sleep specialist for help and to rule out any underlying sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

And now, I'm sounding the alarm bell about glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You might not have heard much about this colorless, odorless, sweet-tasting food-additive, but you're about to, because this stuff is putting kids in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycerol is a chemical that's used by Big Food to keep products moist, improve their texture and, perhaps above all else, replace added sugar in so-called healthy offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you were doing your best to avoid the usual suspects — high-fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, refined sugar — this little nightmare snuck in under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You'll find glycerol in some brands of protein bars, baked goods, dairy products, and, most notoriously in the United Kingdom, brightly colored slushie drinks that children love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sounds harmless, right? It's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in the UK recently studied the cases of 21 children, ranging in age from two to seven-year-old, who were hospitalized shortly after drinking a single 'zero-sugar' slushie that was artificially sweetened with glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yes, you read that right. A single slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the U.S. Glycerol is just one of 10,000 chemicals that the food industry can legally sneak into your food under an FDA loophole created by Congress in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the children lost consciousness. Four needed brain scans. One had a seizure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newly identified condition is being called 'glycerol intoxication syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In adults, too much glycerol can cause headaches, nausea, dizziness, and bloating. But children's bodies are smaller, their metabolism works differently, and when they consume too much glycerol at once, their blood sugar can drop so fast that they can black out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, glycerol isn't new. It's been added to food for decades – only now, the food industry is using more of it. A lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some jurisdictions in the US have implemented 'sugar taxes' or surcharges on sweetened beverages to discourage their consumption by making them more expensive. And the public has also become far more health conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So Big Food has responded by cutting down on sugar content. But the food industry is also desperate to keep things sweet, so they've loaded up their products with sugar substitutes, like glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as glycerin, this additive is a sugar alcohol. It's not sugar, but it tastes like it. And kids are consuming more of it in than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slushies in the UK are some of the biggest offenders, because either sugar or glycerol is needed to keep the drinks from freezing into solid blocks of goo. And the result is children are getting dosed with more sugar alcohol than their little bodies can handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the truly shocking part: glycerol is technically considered 'safe' by the Food and Drug Administration and some European Union food agencies. Though let's be real: 'safe' according to these food regulators may only mean 'not immediately lethal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, glycerol is one of 10,000 chemicals that the food industry can legally sneak into your food under an FDA loophole created by Congress in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back then 'Generally Recognized As Safe' or GRAS standards were established to exempt certain food additives – like salt, yeast, flour and eggs – from the FDA's rigorous pre-market review and approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That meant no independent testing and no long-term studies. Food manufacturers got to decide for themselves if something was 'safe' before adding it to your favorite snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Also known as glycerin, this additive is a sugar alcohol. It's not sugar, but it tastes like it. And kids are consuming more of it in than ever before (stock image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the good news. On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to eliminate GRAS standards for many foods sold in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've launched a review of the GRAS standards, and we're going to get rid of the GRAS standards for most products,' Kennedy told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have 10,000 [GRAS] ingredients [in the US]… and in Europe they only have 400, and [Americans] have the worst chronic disease burden of any country in the world.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is undoubtably a great step towards addressing America's health crisis but there's no reason to wait for Kennedy to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You aren't powerless. You have agency, and it's time to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Read every damn label. If it says glycerol, glycerin, or E422 (a European Union designation) — put it back on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoid buying ultra processed food for yourself and your kids as often as possible. I know — it's easy, it's convenient, and they love it. But what's more important? Their long-term health or a momentary tantrum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demand better. Food companies aren't really going to change unless we force them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speak up. Complain. Stop buying from brands that put profit over people. Educate your kids. Teach them to recognize garbage ingredients and make better choices. They're never too young to learn how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, you are the gatekeeper of what goes into your body and your child. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and don't trust that, just because something is sold in a store, it's safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Jillian is a TV star, author and health expert.

                                        &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;. To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/march-24-1882-robert-koch-announces-his-discovery-of-the-cause-of-tuberculosis"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; The day we discovered the cause of the ‘white death’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years. Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive “wasting away,” due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-treatments-yield-hope-for-stopping-tuberculosis-worlds-leading-infectious-killer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; New treatments yield hope for stopping tuberculosis, world’s leading infectious killer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king’s evil&lt;/a&gt;.” This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the “robber of youth” due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/can-new-medications-shift-the-battle-against-drug-resistant-tb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Can new medications shift the battle against drug-resistant TB?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone grafts&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="attachment_513958" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-513958" class=" wp-image-513958" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/GettyImages-1042128494-1024x683.jpg" alt="Secondary tuberculosis infection, illustration" srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/GettyImages-1042128494-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/GettyImages-1042128494-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/GettyImages-1042128494-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/GettyImages-1042128494-425x283.jpg 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/GettyImages-1042128494-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-513958" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Close-up view of an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/boston-tb-outbreak-bartenders"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How Boston stamped out a TB outbreak thanks to bartenders and barbers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6 percent from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15 percent from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/nonprofit-drug-maker-produces-tb-antibiotic-after-private-companies-wouldnt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nonprofit drug maker produces TB antibiotic after private companies wouldn’t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-dr-arthur-conan-doyle-cracked-the-case-of-the-tuberculosis-remedy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle cracked the case of the tuberculosis ‘remedy’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years. In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My book&lt;em&gt; Get Changed &lt;/em&gt;was inspired by meeting so many women who were in life crisis mode, looking in the mirror and not liking (or not recognising) the person reflected. The one thing you do have control over is how you look, and that affects how you feel, and therefore how you present yourself in the world and how you are perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best advice is to put time&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;into your wardrobe. If you were throwing a dinner party, you’d think about the guests, the vibe, the foods and drinks that go together and you’d probably practice the dish first. Why wouldn’t you pay the same attention to the image of yourself you present to the world? Anything less is doing a disservice to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about the volume of clothes you own, the secret is finding&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;your style, the things that make you feel more confident. Try and buy less but better quality. But it’s a bugbear when privileged people slag off fast fashion; 99 per cent of the population can’t afford cashmere and have to wear polyester. You don’t need to be wealthy to find your image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just spending five minutes putting on your face – which for me is painting on eyebrows (mine seem to have vanished), applying mascara, eyeliner and blusher – makes me look less of a corpse. And yes I do that even to walk on the beach or collect my post, thank you. It changes how I hold myself, and then how people treat me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to have good hair, I know, and every other week I get it blow dried (and probably don’t wash it in between…) That’s my biggest extravagance but it makes me feel good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;If you’re struggling with the menopause, consider HRT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first noticed changes in my late 40s. My hip ached a bit, but otherwise my symptoms were mental rather than physical. I had anxiety, sleepless nights, and had stopped feeling joy. It felt like wading through treacle to get out of bed. Even a lovely day with family and friends would leave me feeling a bit ‘meh’. I was numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also had terrible &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/menopause/menopause-brain/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;, forgetting names which I was usually good with. The funny thing is, my friends were the same, we’d say to each other “did you watch that thing last night with thingy in it” and somehow know what was meant. There must be middle-aged women across the land communicating in a sort of menopause “franglaise”. We laugh but feeling less sharp erodes confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/menopause/hrt-health-risks/"&gt;using HRT&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 and I’ve never looked back – it improved &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/menopause/menopause-brain/"&gt;my brain fog&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and energy levels. It was like someone switching the lights back on again. You need to feel in the right frame of mind to make any life changes, so if you’re feeling out of kilter because of hormones get them sorted before you make any decision that needs clarity and clear focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Don’t allow motherhood to turn you into a martyr&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After divorce, I faced a lot of criticism, mostly from other women calling me selfish for having “walked away from the kids”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never walked away from the children, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/walked-out-on-marriage/"&gt;only my marriage&lt;/a&gt;. (Though I appreciate that’s not easy to hear when you’re the one who’s been left, but there’s always one person who does have to leave the house, and it’s rarely about leaving the kids.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mums we will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; feel guilty about our children, but you have to put on your own oxygen mask first, as they say in planes. Children benefit from happier mums yet for around two decades of our life we put ourselves last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was out the other night having some drinks to celebrate a 30 year old friend’s birthday. There were four of us women in our 50s and divorced, and as one of us wryly joked, “the next 20 years might be a bit s--t at times”. Because mums always come last! The kids do make it worthwhile of course, but buckle up as it’s a total roller-coaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daughter is now at university and we speak every single day. I have one son at boarding school and the other has the security of living in the same home he’s always had, with his father. But my role as mother is to raise them to be independent humans, not to control them. Practical circumstances unfortunately dictate that I can’t see my children every day, but do they know I’m always there for them? Of course. I see them all the time, they know I am always there for them and for security and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A useful question I’ve found is “would I want my daughter to be in this situation?” If my daughter was in an unhappy relationship I’d tell her to leave, so would most mums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mother might be seen as “evil” if she’s pictured having fun when she’s not with her children, but I know full well my children don’t want me spending my time apart from them crying alone. That would be a horrible pressure for them. And by the time they’re teenagers they have lives of their own, or prefer to be grunting in their own rooms, they don’t want a mum to be constantly hovering over them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why women need to carve out their own lives, or face being devastated and lost when they’re left with an empty nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Sad days are normal, but try and reframe the negatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because I seem confident doesn’t mean I always wake up positive. Back in my 30s when the children were very young I had a nervous breakdown. A year’s worth of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/"&gt;CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy)&lt;/a&gt; sorted me out and one tip I’ve carried on with is thinking about three things to look forward to that day as soon as I wake up. Nice things give your brain a serotonin boost. They can be tiny thoughts: the lovely coffee I’ll have soon, what I’ll eat for lunch or knowing I’ll walk on a beach (my happy place) that weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also try to counteract every negative with a positive. So when my flat rental recently fell through (which was probably more stressful than it should have been), I reminded myself how lucky I am to have a Suffolk home I can move to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Don’t take criticism personall&lt;strong&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing someone walk away from their marriage naturally made people I know hold up a mirror to their own – and they might not like what they see. It’s frustrating that when you put your head above the parapet, as I did, many women will put you down in a bid to make themselves better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to judge a woman who’s going against the grain of society’s norm, but before you criticise please try and walk in someone else’s shoes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One phrase I wish I’d known all my life is this: “That sounds like a ‘you’ problem”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean comments often come from a place of envy and insecurity, too, people might say “it’s alright for you, you have money to have your freedom”. What I want to point out is that’s because I’ve slogged away to earn this freedom, going to work for the hours the kids were at school instead of honing my bottom for hours doing yoga or playing tennis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that financial freedom is empowering and, yes, financially independent women are in a much better position to make life choices. As will our daughters, hopefully, now we’ve carved the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rise above criticism. Once you start caring less what other people think, that’s where true confidence comes from, then there’s nothing to hold you back from making the most of whatever amazing second spring awaits you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Susanna Galton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But what happens to those who witness others going through traumatic experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military veterans, first responders, and even bystanders make up 10 percent of PTSD cases. New research from Virginia Tech sheds light on this often-overlooked group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found that observing trauma causes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/work-stress-linked-to-higher-stroke-risk-in-young-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;unique changes&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. These differ from changes seen in people who directly experience trauma. This discovery may lead to improved and more specific treatments for PTSD in those who are indirectly affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, patients with directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD are treated the same way – with a combination of therapy and medication,” said Timothy Jarome, the project’s principal investigator and associate professor of neurobiology in the &lt;a href="https://cals.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;College of Agriculture and Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that indirect trauma and direct trauma create different biological responses, which could mean they require different treatment strategies that target distinct brain pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-observation-can-also-harm-the-brain"&gt;Observation can also harm the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Jarome has long studied memory-related disorders such as PTSD and dementia. His interest in bystander PTSD began after the 2021 Miami condominium collapse. He noticed that even people who saw the tragedy from afar showed symptoms like insomnia and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who saw it from across the street reported that they were suffering from nightmares, insomnia, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-health-may-be-the-key-to-anxiety-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” noted Professor Jarome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were showing symptoms of PTSD, but didn’t go through it or have any connection to the people in the building. We sought out to understand the brain mechanisms behind how that occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, Jarome’s team focused on three main brain regions that are linked to fear memory: the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. They examined how trauma changed proteins in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings confirmed that indirect trauma triggers different patterns in protein degradation in these three brain areas than direct trauma does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ptsd-from-trauma-differs-by-gender"&gt;PTSD from trauma differs by gender&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered gender-based differences in how brains process indirect trauma. Past work by Jarome’s lab had linked the K-63 ubiquitin protein to PTSD in women. This new research builds on that and confirms that female and male brains don’t respond to observed trauma in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight significant biological differences in how male and female brains respond to witnessing trauma,” said study lead author Shaghayegh Navabpour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These differences may help explain why women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, leading to more targeted treatments that consider these sex-specific factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens a door to designing treatment plans based on the type of trauma experienced and the gender of the patient. Jarome’s next step involves studying the role of empathy in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-significantly-lowers-heart-disease-risk-by-reducing-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is rooted in a brain area called the anterior insular cortex and could explain why witnessing trauma affects people so deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-contributions-to-ptsd-trauma-research"&gt;Contributions to PTSD trauma research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was made possible by a $420,000 grant from the &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;. It funded materials and supported student researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At academic institutions, students – undergraduate, graduate, and postdocs – are the driving force for research,” Jarome said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While faculty members might secure the funding to do the projects, the reality is that the work is done by these students as they’re going through their training. Without graduate students, especially, but also undergraduates and postdocs, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-eats-away-our-brains-cognitive-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navabpour is a former &lt;a href="https://www.vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt; Ph.D. student in translational biology, medicine, and health. She now works as a postdoctoral researcher at &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; on drug development for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My time in Dr. Jarome’s lab was hugely valuable in shaping my career and preparing me for my current role as a postdoc and my goal of becoming a faculty member,” said Navabpour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned how to think scientifically –  how to ask the right questions and approach problems critically – and gained hands-on experience with key methods and techniques that continue to inform my research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study changes how we view PTSD and its link to trauma.

While both the LSD and placebo groups showed improvements over six weeks, there was no meaningful difference between the two. These results challenge popular claims about the benefits of microdosing psychedelics and emphasize the importance of placebo-controlled studies when evaluating treatments that are often promoted through anecdotal evidence. The research was published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2831639" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, more commonly known as ADHD, affects nearly three percent of adults worldwide. The condition involves persistent difficulties with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, often leading to significant struggles in work, relationships, and daily functioning. Standard treatments typically include stimulant medications like amphetamines or methylphenidate, which can be effective but don’t work for everyone. About one in three patients don’t get enough relief, and many stop taking the medications due to side effects or concerns about long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the idea of microdosing psychedelics—taking very small amounts of substances like LSD or psilocybin—has gained popularity. Some users claim that microdosing improves focus, emotional balance, and creativity, and many report using it to self-treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Microdoses are usually about one-tenth of a recreational dose, small enough that they don’t cause noticeable changes in perception. But despite the enthusiasm online and in the media, there has been little clinical research testing whether microdosing actually works as a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test these claims, researchers from University Hospital Basel in Switzerland and Maastricht University in the Netherlands conducted a six-week, placebo-controlled trial. They recruited 53 adults diagnosed with moderate to severe ADHD and randomly assigned them to receive either a low dose of LSD or a placebo. The study was double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving which treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were contracted by the company Mindmed to perform this work which was within our line of work on psychedelics,” explained study author Matthias Liechti, the head of the Clinical Pharmacology Division of the University Hospital Basel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were given their assigned substance twice a week under supervision. The dose of LSD—20 micrograms—is considered to be at the higher end of the microdosing range and was chosen to increase the chance of detecting any therapeutic benefit. Throughout the study, participants completed various assessments measuring ADHD symptoms, including both self-reported and observer-rated scales. Researchers also collected information about side effects, vital signs, and subjective drug experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the six weeks, both the LSD and placebo groups had shown significant reductions in ADHD symptoms. On the primary measure, symptoms improved by an average of 7.1 points in the LSD group and 8.9 points in the placebo group. This difference was not statistically meaningful. Across all other symptom ratings and time points, the two groups continued to show nearly identical improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in both groups also experienced similar benefits when they believed they were receiving the active drug. Interestingly, after the final dose, 80% of participants—whether they had taken LSD or placebo—guessed they had received LSD. Those who believed they had taken LSD tended to report greater symptom improvement, regardless of what they had actually received. This suggests that expectations may have played a large role in how participants experienced the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a well-designed study, low dose LSD (microdosing) is not more effective than placebo in patients with ADHD,” Liechti told PsyPost. “We observed marked therapeutic improvements in many patients and were surprised to see at the end of the study that they were equally frequent in the placebo group. Both LSD and placebo are effective over time but placebo and expectancy effects are the reason for this, not the LSD effect. This highlights the need for a well-blinded placebo control group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, participants who took LSD did experience more noticeable short-term drug effects, such as changes in perception and feelings of altered consciousness. These effects were mild but significantly stronger than those reported by the placebo group. Still, the LSD dose used in the study was well tolerated overall. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, fatigue, insomnia, and mild visual changes. Two participants dropped out of the LSD group due to uncomfortable effects. There were no serious medical events or psychiatric complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not find LSD to be effective for treating ADHD, it does offer some important insights. First, it shows that low doses of LSD can produce measurable but tolerable psychological effects in a clinical setting. It also demonstrates that strong placebo responses are possible in psychedelic studies, even when the dose is too low to cause intense hallucinations. This supports concerns that anecdotal reports of success with microdosing may be driven more by belief than biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that the study was one of the few in psychedelic research to achieve successful blinding. In most psychedelic trials, the noticeable effects of high doses make it easy for participants to guess whether they’re receiving the active substance. In this case, the use of a low dose meant that even placebo recipients often believed they had received LSD, reducing the influence of expectation bias to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some past studies have suggested that higher doses of LSD may help with anxiety or depression, this trial does not provide evidence that low doses help with ADHD. Further research is needed to explore other psychedelics and different dosing schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study used a relatively high dose of 20 micrograms, but a lower dose of 10 micrograms—or a dosing schedule of every day or every other day—might produce different results,” Liechti said. “It is not likely though. High-doses of LSD have consistently been shown to be effective in anxiety and depressive disorders. Thus, such high doses may also be effective in the treatment of mood in ADHD patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0044" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Safety and Efficacy of Repeated Low-Dose LSD for ADHD Treatment in Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Lorenz Mueller, Joyce Santos de Jesus, Yasmin Schmid, Felix Müller, Anna Becker, Aaron Klaiber, Isabelle Straumann, Dino Luethi, Eline C.

led the analysis which involved 72,460 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Around one in six were deemed non-attenders, having missed every single appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This put them at a 45 percent higher risk of dying from prostate cancer compared to those who showed up to their appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The groundbreaking research spans 20 years (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Meanwhile, those who attended had a 23 percent lower risk of dying from prostate cancer and non-attenders had a 39 percent higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Explaining the discrepancy, lead study author, Renée Leenen, M.D., Ph.D., of the cancer institute in the Netherlands, said: "It may be that men who opted not to attend a screening appointment are care avoiders - meaning they’re less likely to engage in healthy behaviors and preventative care in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She added: "This is the opposite behavior of people who are perhaps more health-conscious and are more likely to attend a screening appointment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Leenen also said healthcare professionals need to 'better understand' who the men are and why they choose not to attend appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"This will help us to design population-based prostate cancer screening programmes that encourage higher rates of informed participation. Tackling attendance rates in this way could be a big factor in the long-term success of a national prostate screening programme," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The findings from the study are now scheduled to be presented at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress in Madrid, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’ve been affected by any of these issues and want to speak to someone in confidence, contact the American Cancer Society on 1-800-227-2345 or via their &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/online-help/contact-us.html#:~:text=Call%20us%20at%201%2D800%2D227%2D2345&amp;amp;text=Ask%20us%20how%20you%20can,patient%2Drelated%20programs%20or%20resources"&gt;&lt;em&gt;live chat feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;available 24/7 every day of the year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 15:50:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdzZzUkFqSHMtYi1RSWpFY3RuZHdhci1HNFVKaWFrbVhfUlNVNlRIQTBJZ3F3c19ia0lxSnRESXBPb21taHJpMUV1MGRqS2dMSi1PVW1qYS1HMC1DOXNnUmRUQUtzUkppNHNqMnFjYVpqV2stLUxXSmpLRDdNMV9oYzFSVjN1LTlhVmFHN2xlRWJral9nRENZ</guid></item><item><title>Woman hospitalized with mystery illness caused by red meat... and millions more are at risk - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two women who mysteriously developed vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing and a life-threatening allergic reaction were found to be suffering from a rare tick-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neither woman, one from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-924846e0-059d-11f0-97cf-e7043735ec11"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and one from Washington, had any history of food allergies but began experiencing reactions after eating red meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking a patient history revealed both women had been bitten by a tick within the last month and blood testing confirmed they had developed alpha-gal syndrome (AGS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AGS is triggered &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12288473/Disease-carried-mites-kills-70-PERCENT-sufferers-US.html"&gt;when a person is bitten by a tick&lt;/a&gt; - most commonly the lone star tick - that carries the alpha-gal sugar. When the tick bites someone it injects the sugar into the person's body and causes the immune system to develop antibodies that attack it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alpha-gal molecules are also found in the meat of most mammals, including pork, beef, venison and other red meats, as well as milk, gelatin or other animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a person eats these foods, the body detects the alpha-gal and attacks it. This immune response can lead to a life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have said they are not aware of any confirmed deaths from AGS, but have rising concerns over the spread of the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2017 and 2022, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-03680f70-0596-11f0-97cf-e7043735ec11" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; reported about 90,000 suspected cases of AGS - and the number of new suspected cases increased by approximately 15,000 each year. The agency estimates as many as half a million Americans have AGS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is triggered when a person is bitten by a tick - most commonly the lone star tick (pictured above) - that carries the alpha-gal sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases were predominantly in southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the US, but recent testing on human and tick samples suggests millions more Americans could be at risk because the tick that causes AGS is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11078351/Tick-borne-illnesses-increased-350-rural-America-2007.html"&gt;spreading to new geographical areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, it's been found the condition is increasingly being passed on to humans by new species of ticks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-0577_article"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC detailed a 61-year-old woman from Washington state who experienced two allergic reactions - one requiring hospitalization - after bitten by an unknown tick about one to two months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her first allergic reaction occurred 29 days after the bite and she developed hives and lip swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After taking an allergy medication her symptoms improved, but a month later, the woman experienced itching in her groin and hives on her back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her tongue began to swell and she had difficulty speaking. She called 911 and was rushed to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Enroute her symptoms worsened and she experienced difficulty breathing, spreading hives and worsening tongue swelling. Her blood pressure dropped dangerously low and her heartrate sped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was given epinephrine - the typical treatment for allergic reactions - but her symptoms worsened and her throat began to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman was then given steroids and by the time she arrived at the hospital her condition began to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she originally reported no significant event preceding either allergic reaction, in later interviews she said about a month before the first episode she had been bitten by a tick and was treated with an antibiotic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows where alpha-gal syndrome cases have been reported in the US between 2017 and 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, she revealed she had eaten six beef tacos before the first episode and consumed a pork sausage and ham sandwich before the second episode took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alpha-gal levels are measured in the blood in kilounits per liter (kU/L) to detect AGS. The woman's blood tests revealed her alpha-gal levels were 27.4 kU/L. Any result over 0.1 kU/L is considered positive for AGS, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was advised to stop eating red meat and avoid milk and gelatin. While avoiding the foods she experienced no other allergic reactions and her alpha-gal levels fell to about 7 kU/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About three years later in April 2020, however, she was bitten by a western black-legged tick. Three days after the bite her alpha-gal levels were 0.72 kU/L. A month later they rose to 20 kU/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another two years later she was bitten by another western-black-legged tick. Shortly after discovering the bite her alpha-gal levels were 0.89 kU/L. Those rose to 18.8 kU/L four weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case report authors credit her vegetarian diet for preventing any dangerous allergic reactions she would have suffered from eating red meat because of her elevated alpha-gal levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The second new &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; released by the CDC Thursday detailed a 45-year-old woman from Maine who found a deer tick on her arm in May 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tick was removed and while she was left with slight swelling and redness, the woman experienced no other immediate side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, about 10 days later, the woman consumed roasted rabbit and about two hours later developed abdominal pain and fatigue that lasted three hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the next two weeks she had recurrent similar symptoms every time she ate red meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About three weeks after the tick bite, she experienced a 'severe' episode of diarrhea and vomiting after eating beef, prompting her to go to her doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood test results revealed her alpha-gal levels were more than 100 kU/L - greater than the maximum limit of detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors advised the woman to avoid pork, beef and lamb. She was able to tolerate small amounts of dairy but foods like ice cream caused nausea and cramping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the avoidance diet, her symptoms resolved but she found two more ticks within two months of the initial episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she tried to eat bacon three months later and steak seven months after that she experienced heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, 10 months after her first tick bite, she was able to eat steak and roast beef with no symptoms and she returned to eating red meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after her first testing, her alpha-gal levels declined to 16 kU/L and at two years they were 4.6 kU/L. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authors of both case reports stressed the importance of increased surveillance of AGS and the types of ticks people acquire the condition from as ticks and states that historically have not posed the risk of AGS are increasingly being traced as the source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 15:39:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Snack Your Way to Lower Cholesterol With This One Simple Change - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNdXNab2pxSVhHc2taUXYwRVhoUkowbThNX1d3ckZHeHRaWGVFQXlBMUttcHktRkRuWVVNRnpidEl6RXBpdjVicTFTQjNUUWlfd2tyTjQ4bml2UmlNUkRkMW9qZEs2QUttdkpIVmdYUWUwRHkwVnpvbDRDalhpV3dzOFliXy1mQ2xCbDRTUWlXWVUtVlU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 15:22:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNdXNab2pxSVhHc2taUXYwRVhoUkowbThNX1d3ckZHeHRaWGVFQXlBMUttcHktRkRuWVVNRnpidEl6RXBpdjVicTFTQjNUUWlfd2tyTjQ4bml2UmlNUkRkMW9qZEs2QUttdkpIVmdYUWUwRHkwVnpvbDRDalhpV3dzOFliXy1mQ2xCbDRTUWlXWVUtVlU</guid></item><item><title>‘They have no one to follow’: how migrating birds use quantum mechanics to navigate - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPUldNR3VrSHBVSG9WYUNzdFptREFYNjhobzZENzNKU2RfWF9yV21OMlVoOU5ST01obTdNVVRHbVVpV1BORmJROVlDX1hTdU16NDhQX2tIUXFrMU5pbUZNcEV4SHNkM004RWF2QklyLVJvVUJVSGdsc3JvcGJaRnFhdDY4MzhUZklDeDgxV0ZYZEY3enpRaWI4ZnFGUnpZZ1lhWjJaSVNlcVUyOG5YcTV3Skw2dEc1UDRYenVrd2JyMXBNMGU3dUpF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o the seasoned ear, the trilling of chiffchaffs and wheatears is as sure a sign of spring as the first defiant crocuses. By March, these birds have started to return from their winter breaks, navigating their way home to breeding grounds thousands of kilometres away – some species returning to home territory &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0176-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;with centimetre precision&lt;/a&gt;. Although the idea of migration often conjures up striking visions of vast flocks of geese and murmurations of starlings, “the majority,” says &lt;a href="https://ifv-vogelwarte.de/en/institute/staff/prof-dr-miriam-liedvogel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Miriam Liedvogel&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Institute of Avian Research (IAR) in Germany, “migrate at night and by themselves, so they have no one to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Liedvogel has had a fascination with birds since childhood, and often wondered how they navigate these lengthy migrations. She is not alone, with even Aristotle pondering the mystery and mistakenly concluding that redstarts change into robins over the winter. As Liedvogel points out, migration behaviour is varied and much remains unknown, but we now have enough data on bird behaviour to rule out species transmogrification, among other theories. Studies have revealed that 95% of migrating birds travel at night, alone, and without parental guidance, so the behaviour must be partly inherited. These birds use the Earth’s magnetic field to find their way, and it is likely that at least part of the biological mechanism that allows them to do this can be explained through quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"science","tags":[{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"science/physics","type":"Keyword","title":"Physics"},{"id":"environment/birds","type":"Keyword","title":"Birds"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","type":"Keyword","title":"Wildlife"},{"id":"world/animals","type":"Keyword","title":"Animals"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theobserver","type":"Publication","title":"The Observer"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"The New Review"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/discover","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Discover"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"Tracking","title":"Observer New Review"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"science/2025/mar/23/they-have-no-one-to-follow-how-migrating-birds-use-quantum-mechanics-to-navigate","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"prebidCriteo":true,"okta":true,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"abDeferPermutiveLoad":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"abTheTradeDesk":true,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"abPrebidBidCache":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":true},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Biophysicist Klaus Schulten came up with &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1524/zpch.1978.111.1.001/html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the idea currently favoured&lt;/a&gt; for explaining magnetic field-sensing in birds in 1978, alongside his colleagues Charles Swenberg and Albert Weller at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Germany. The idea hinges on what happens when electrons gain energy. A more familiar response might be the generation of a current, as in a photovoltaic device (or solar cell) when the sun is out, but other effects can take place too. Electrons favour hanging out in pairs, but absorbing energy can lead to an electron moving from one molecule to another. At this point, both the molecule gaining and the molecule donating an electron have unpaired electrons, earning those molecules the hippy-sounding term “free radical”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2be92852-2e4a-4c1a-a4e7-125222a5efc6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A flock of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) perch on power lines in France during their southerly migration. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Nature Picture Library/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Electrons have a quantum property described as “spin”, and when two free radicals are formed in this way, the spins take on a particular arrangement that is sensitive to magnetic fields. This means that any change in biochemistry the molecule undergoes during the bird’s natural bodily processes – and the rates of these reactions – will be affected by the presence of a magnetic field. So this “radical pair effect” could allow birds to sense a magnetic field. However, researchers have also suggested that a little bit of magnetic iron oxide incorporated into a bird’s beak could do much the same thing, acting as a tiny compass needle. Particles of magnetite get everywhere: they’re inside the food we eat and are carried on the air that we breathe, so it’s inevitable that they end up in our bodily tissues. People have reported finding them inside the heads of birds, although not where they can enter the brain for it to sense magnetic fields. What is more, a bit of magnetite alone could not explain the navigating behaviour people observe in birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/peter-hore" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Peter Hore&lt;/a&gt; is a professor of chemistry at Oxford University, who has been studying the possible mechanisms allowing birds to sense magnetic fields for more than 20 years, and he lists some of the evidence in favour of the radical pair effect. One finding is that birds do not seem to be able to sense the difference between north and south poles in a magnetic field, so much as the direction towards a pole or an equator. “That suggested it [the magnetic sensing] was not based on magnetic minerals, which behave like compass needles,” says Hore. Put a bird in the opposite hemisphere and it will &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0295" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;still aim its flight towards the equator&lt;/a&gt; for warmer weather in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Another compelling finding is that it seems light is needed for birds such as robins to sense the magnetic field, and it is needed to kickstart the radical pair effect too. At the quantum level, all measurements are accompanied by an exchange of energy. Looking in detail at the wavelengths of light absorbed in the radical pair effect has also pointed towards a particular protein: cryptochrome 4. Schulten suggested in 2000 that a cryptochrome protein might be a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(00)76629-X" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;plausible candidate&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the radical pair mechanism in birds, although at the time cryptochromes had only just been discovered and only one was known. Liedvogel began her PhD just a few years later and began looking into the cryptochromes known in birds at that time, a study she describes as being “crazy hard”, before then adding: “Now, with much more failure and much more knowledge also, we understand why that was so.” It turns out that while cryptochromes 1, 2 and 4 are found in the eyes of these migrating birds, the binding between cryptochromes 1 and 2 and the crucial light-absorbing pigment in the radical pair effect is not nearly as strong as it is for the later discovered cryptochrome 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It seems that nature has devised quantum technology before us, and that doesn’t sound that crazy, right?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ianis Kominis, University of Crete&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Careful study of the wavelengths of light absorbed by cryptochrome 4 revealed exactly which radicals were forming. In 2021, Hore and his colleagues were able to test the magnetic field sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a robin, which migrates, and compare it with that of a chicken, which doesn’t. They showed that the robin’s protein had a greater sensitivity to magnetic fields than the chicken’s. Furthermore, when they mutated the candidate parts of the protein flagged as forming the radicals, no magnetic field sensitivity effects were detected. All this strongly favoured the radical pair mechanism in cryptochrome 4 proteins as the basis for magnetic field-sensing in birds, despite the tiny values of the energies involved. The Earth’s magnetic field strength at the surface is a mere 50 microtesla – a standard medical MRI uses fields at least 20,000 times higher – so the energies these interactions amount to are tiny: a million times smaller than the thermal energy of the molecules just jigging around at body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c7a1a382-77be-42da-a5c7-fe377413257a" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Prof Dr Miriam Liedvogel of the Institute of Avian Research, Germany, with a female blackcap.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Melina Moersdorf/MPG&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;With the discovery of cryptochrome 4 and evidence in its favour for the radical pair effect, Liedvogel took another tack and set out to look for signs of adaptive selection optimising the protein in the evolution of birds that migrate seasonally. She and Corinna Langebrake, who was then completing a PhD with Liedvogel at IAR, looked at all the known bird genome sequences and compared regions relevant for the production of cryptochromes in birds that migrate versus those that do not. They found that in cryptochromes 1 and 2 there was very little variation across species, which can be indicative that those proteins are universally essential, as changes would then be hazardous to survival. As Liedvogel points out, these proteins are responsible for maintaining circadian rhythms – the “body clock” – so that much all adds up. What is more, they found higher levels of variation not just in the cryptochrome 4 of migrating birds versus non-migrating birds, but in the region of cryptochrome 4 that produces radicals in the radical pair effect. There are also other regions of apparently high selectivity in cryptochrome 4, possibly pointing towards an additional but as yet unknown function of the protein. Perhaps harder to explain, however, is the absence of cryptochrome 4 in a group of birds that includes solitary long-distance nocturnal migrants, the tyranni. Behavioural experiments are under way to test whether these birds can sense the Earth’s magnetic field in the way that the cryptochrome 4 radical pair mechanism model seeks to explain, but the jury is still out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Meanwhile, a paper published earlier this year suggests that there may be a limit to how far evolution can go in terms of improving a bird’s sensitivity to magnetic fields thanks to a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. “There are trade-offs in all aspects of physical reality,” explains Iannis Kominis, an associate professor at the University of Crete in Greece, whose research has focused on quantum sensing and quantum biology in parallel for 15 years. A key trade-off in quantum mechanics is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/10/what-is-heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt;, which limits how precisely you can pin down two variables, such as energy and time – the better the handle you have on one, the less you have on the other. If you follow this line of maths and logic to its natural conclusions, and given the time it takes for a physical process to happen, then you eventually land on a tiny but finite quantum of energy below which you cannot go. Since a measurement must be accompanied by an exchange of energy, this places a fundamental limit on the achievable sensitivity – whether that comes from a quantum device operating in a lab at cryogenic temperatures or a protein in a bird’s eye. Earlier this year, Kominis, together with an undergraduate student at the university, Efthymios&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Gkoudinakis, showed that the limit is &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prxlife/abstract/10.1103/PRXLife.3.013004" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;respected in the animal kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, although the sensitivity achieved with the radical pair mechanism could get very close to this limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It seems that nature has devised quantum technology before us, and that doesn’t sound that crazy, right?” says Kominis. “The opposite would mean that we are smarter than nature.” He also suggests that where the sensitivity achieved is not so close to the limit, there is room to advance quantum sensing technology using “the IP from mother nature to try to make a better product”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Quantum calculations have also highlighted potential evidence in favour of the radical pair effect through the response of birds to magnetic “noise”. Calculations show that the radical pair electrons are actually swapping between “spin” states at specific frequencies, which means that the birds could become disoriented if exposed to a magnetic field fluctuating at those frequencies. “It’s not often that you can sit at your computer and do some quantum mechanical calculations and predict how an animal is going to behave,” adds Hore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1ed70712-bac2-4bf6-ae7d-9b82311f99cb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A northern wheatear, Oenanthe oenanthe, in flight at the Parc Naturel Régional d’Armorique, Brittany, France.

Mouritsen and his colleagues are now testing the frequencies at which a bird becomes disoriented. So far, these tally rather well with what has been calculated for the radical pair mechanism, but Hore explains such behavioural tests are time consuming, partly since they can only be conducted during migration season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although Hore and Liedvogel are cautious of suggesting the case is closed, the accruing data on bird behaviour, their proteins and the radical pair effect do seem to be converging on an explanation for birds’ sensitivity to magnetic fields. If correct, it amounts to an incredible feat of quantum sensing achieved not in some hi-tech cryogenic lab but in the messy organic environment of a bird’s eye. “I certainly do look at birds in a different light,” says Hore. “The term ‘bird brain’ is normally an insult – I now think of it as a compliment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 15:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPUldNR3VrSHBVSG9WYUNzdFptREFYNjhobzZENzNKU2RfWF9yV21OMlVoOU5ST01obTdNVVRHbVVpV1BORmJROVlDX1hTdU16NDhQX2tIUXFrMU5pbUZNcEV4SHNkM004RWF2QklyLVJvVUJVSGdsc3JvcGJaRnFhdDY4MzhUZklDeDgxV0ZYZEY3enpRaWI4ZnFGUnpZZ1lhWjJaSVNlcVUyOG5YcTV3Skw2dEc1UDRYenVrd2JyMXBNMGU3dUpF</guid></item><item><title>Popular NDC journalist Oheneba Boamah 'weeps' after being denied Forestry Commission PRO position - GhanaWeb</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6gFBVV95cUxQbW50UlJvTi1rYThUZjg2bUlPX1ZpLU5lalpWbFF3cmczcnM0TExCeU9WcExMNmJBaWdhdVEwYkJNVHItanpZQzZHMjZJc2NZVFdfdmFIMlhKanFJdlhTRDF0WVNUV0NHeGQ4ZE1qb2FLMHJMOXdZeU1ZMzNkdFI2bnJTLVNvRkhZMDRDTjBQTlZhc1liNUlEbkFSU2o5bXVNVmlaUGFZVmxGNVI1X2trSlBvOUg5djNkYjlxU3VHZmZZU2lUa21iYUVnM3RNb3NtOTlTbG8wUDY0b1hrNFplNXBINElxOENVMnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-left"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Oheneba Boamah, a popular broadcast journalist aligned with the ruling NDC has called on the party's leadership to pay close attention to the Forestry Commission after he was denied the position of Public Relations Officer (PRO) at the Commission.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Narrating the events that led to his missed opportunity, he cited Dr Hugh Brown, CEO of the commission, as the person who allegedly blocked him from getting the position.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In a snippet from the ‘Gumbe’ show circulating on Tiktok, Oheneba Boamah is seen venting his frustration over this development.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“We wanted to be placed at the administration of the Forestry Commission. So, we called Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah. He was out of the country. So, he said, he will meet us on his return and indeed he met us in his office. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"He called the Forestry Commission’s office and spoke to the head of HR and asked us to go see him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“He first called the HR and followed up with a call to the CEO Dr Hugh Brown and told him that he has sent two party faithful to him. They’ve worked tirelessly for the party so they’re coming for placement as PROs at the commission.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Boamah, when he went to the office with his colleague, the HR received them well, but Dr Brown allegedly ignored them after they had waited hours for him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“So, we went to the head of Human Resources. The man is so good. In fact, other party members came to see him while we were there. Then we went to see the CEO. We sat there for hours but we were told he was in a meeting. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“On his return to the office he was swarmed by officers who had come to present reports and documents so we patiently waited outside. When he was done engaging all the people, he briefly stepped out to look around, headed straight to his car and sped off,” Oheneba Boamah recounted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Oheneba, he and his colleagues who made that trip have not heard from the commission to date.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Later I heard that one female party bigwig has warned that if the position of Dr Brown is threatened because of me, I would regret what she would do to me, ” he said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Oheneba Boamah has subsequently made a call to leaders of the party to closely monitor the happenings at the Forestry Commission.&lt;br&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Health officials have confirmed three measles cases in Maryland this month, but say it’s not time to panic about an outbreak given the state’s more than 96% vaccination rate against the highly transmissible virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with outbreaks occurring in other states, experts are urging Marylanders to make sure that they are up to date with their vaccinations, to protect vulnerable populations and ensure that measles stays manageable in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing now with three imported cases, that doesn’t concern me. It’s a reflection of what’s happening globally and people traveling,” said Dr. William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What would concern me is if we started seeing more locally acquired cases where people who did not travel acquired measles in Maryland,” Moss said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/One-Case-of-Measles-Confirmed-in-Maryland.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on March 9 that a Howard County resident who had traveled internationally had contracted measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other international travelers, this time from Prince George’s County, also caught measles while abroad, the health department &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported Thursday.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all three cases were connected to Washington Dulles International Airport, the Prince George’s cases are not related to the Howard County case, according to the health department. And the department said none of the Maryland cases are related to ongoing outbreaks identified in New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have led to fatalities.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But out of “an abundance of caution,” the agency issued a list of potentially exposed flights, Metro lines and hospitals where the public might have been exposed to one of the Maryland cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles cases occur sporadically in Maryland, with one case of measles identified in Maryland earlier this year [the March 9 case], one in 2024, one in 2023, and no cases from 2020-2022,” the department said in a statement Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three cases identified in March alone, should Marylanders expect an outbreak? Public health experts say no — so long as you’re vaccinated, which more than 96% of the state’s residents are, according to Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director for the American Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people who’ve contracted measles virus “happen to go into a community that is unvaccinated or undervaccinated, or around a child under the age of 1 that has not yet had their vaccine, you can see spread,” he said. “But the likelihood of a big outbreak occurring in Maryland is relatively low. Very low.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles starts as a standard respiratory disease, with a fever, runny nose, cough and red, watery eyes. A couple days after the initial symptoms, people sick with measles may develop the illness’s calling card – a red, bumpy rash that starts on the head area and spreads to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moss said that while the measles virus travels more quickly among unvaccinated populations, breakthrough cases among vaccinated people are still possible, though rare. He advised that those who suspect they may have been exposed to measles shouldn’t just walk into an emergency room if they can avoid it, due to how transmissible it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because measles virus is so contagious, you don’t want someone with measles just walking into a crowded emergency room with a lot of other sick people,” Moss said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideally what would happen is that a parent or an individual would contact their health care provider to give them a heads up that … they think they could have measles,” he said. “That way … they can be prepared to handle that patient and make sure that patient doesn’t pass the infection to others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can get vaccinated for measles as early as 6 months old, and Maryland schools require kindergartners to be vaccinated for measles and other diseases before entering class, although the state has a liberal religious exemption policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moss is concerned about a rising national trend of parents asking for religious exemptions from required vaccinations to attend state schools – a trend that Maryland is not immune to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more parents have invoked a religious exemption to opt their children out of vaccination requirements in recent years, which Moss and other public health experts say is an indication of increased vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2023-24 school year, for example, 1.54% of Maryland kindergartners received a religious exemption from required vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine which helps protect against measles, mumps and rubella. Religious exemptions have been growing steadily since 2002-2003, when only 0.2% of students were exempted, state data shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health department data, of those 98.46% of kindergartners who were vaccinated last school year, 99% received the MMR vaccine. Vaccine rates for the current academic year are not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Successful vaccination programs undermine themselves because the disease goes away and people don’t worry about these vaccine-preventable diseases that can actually come back,” Moss said. He added that vaccine hesitancy has grown since the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would hope for many people the current measles outbreak here in the United States is a reminder that measles is still around, that measures can still put people in the hospital, that measles can still kill,” he said. “And that will highlight the value of measles vaccination and that we’ll be able to maintain high measles vaccination coverage here in Maryland and nationally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that if Maryland can maintain high vaccination levels, it can keep a potential future outbreak at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My prediction would be that we’re not going to see many secondary cases as a consequence of these importations in Maryland,” Moss said. “I think we’re pretty good here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, a clinical trial has demonstrated that taking high doses of vitamin D may slow the progression of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, taking too much vitamin D &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/50765-vitamin-d-supplements-toxicity.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/50765-vitamin-d-supplements-toxicity.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can be dangerous&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; however, the high doses in the new trial were taken in controlled conditions, under the supervision of medical staff, and by patients for whom it was deemed safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34785-multiple-sclerosis-inhibits-central-nervous-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34785-multiple-sclerosis-inhibits-central-nervous-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;affects the brain and spinal cord&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Thus, the theory is that having too little vitamin D may allow runaway inflammation to ensue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between low vitamin D and multiple sclerosis was first identified &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8447827869373358867&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1039%2Fc6pp00308g&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fviruses-infections-disease%2Fin-a-1st-trial-finds-vitamin-d-supplements-may-slow-multiple-sclerosis-but-questions-remain" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1039/c6pp00308g" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1039%2Fc6pp00308g&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fviruses-infections-disease%2Fin-a-1st-trial-finds-vitamin-d-supplements-may-slow-multiple-sclerosis-but-questions-remain" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the 1960s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Past trials also tested vitamin D supplementation in patients who were already taking drugs to manage their MS, he told Live Science. This made it harder to determine how effective vitamin D was, in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these hurdles, Thouvenot and colleagues took a different approach in their new trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They looked at the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in 303 patients with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17248-multiple-sclerosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17248-multiple-sclerosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. CIS describes when patients have early signs that are suggestive of multiple sclerosis but they have not yet developed the full-fledged disease and don't meet the diagnostic criteria. Signs of CIS include inflammation and damage to the protective layer around nerve fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not a given that CIS will progress into multiple sclerosis, this is the case for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173580823000561" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173580823000561" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;approximately 85% of MS patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients in the trial had yet to start taking other drugs for multiple sclerosis, so the researchers had a window in which they could directly investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on their disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Multiple sclerosis destroys the insulating outer layer that covers the wires extending from many neurons. That layer, called myelin, is shown in blue in the illustration above. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: koto_feja via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the team randomly assigned 156 of the patients to take a high-dose of a form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol. They took the supplement once every two weeks for two years, or until they showed signs of MS symptoms or new or growing lesions during medical visits. These visits occurred three months after starting supplementation, one year out and then two years out, and they involved brain and spinal cord scans and MS symptom assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If disease activity was detected, patients would be removed from the trial and immediately prescribed disease-modifying drugs, meaning drugs that alleviate symptoms by targeting the root causes of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comparison group of 147 patients underwent the same protocol but took a dummy drug instead of vitamin D, according to a report of the trial published March 10 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831270" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831270" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose the vitamin D group received was 100,000 international units, which is around 20 times more than what &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9088230-11101111?sid=livescience-us-1125311880547502143&amp;amp;url=https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vitamin-d/ID=361633-tier3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vitamin-d/ID=361633-tier3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9088230-11101111?sid=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;url=https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vitamin-d/ID=361633-tier3" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Walgreens" data-merchant-id="11694" data-merchant-network="CJ" data-merchant-url="walgreens.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;common drug store supplements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contain per dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that disease activity occurred in 60% of the vitamin D group within the two-year study window, compared with 74% in the placebo group. The time it took for symptoms to emerge was also significantly longer in the former group than the latter — about 432 days, compared with 224 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings suggest that early supplementation with high-dose vitamin D may help slow the progression of CIS to multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is "important research" and supports the use of high-dose vitamin D by patients with multiple sclerosis, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/blizard/all-staff/profiles/klaus-schmierer.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/blizard/all-staff/profiles/klaus-schmierer.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Klaus Schmierer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology at Queen Mary University of London who was not involved in the new trial. Many doctors already recommend such supplementation, Schmierer told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many clinicians recommend that MS patients take &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/latest-research/research-blog/what-we-know-about-vitamin-d-and-ms" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/research/latest-research/research-blog/what-we-know-about-vitamin-d-and-ms" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between 4,000 and 5,000 international units&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin D each day. Any more than this can cause a condition called hypercalcemia, in which &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;too much calcium builds up in the body&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because vitamin D normally regulates the levels of this mineral in tissues. Hypercalcemia can weaken bones and potentially lead to kidney and heart damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being over the recommended limit for vitamin D supplementation, no one in the new trial who received vitamin D developed hypercalcemia. That hinted that this high dose may be safe in this context, and notably, the participants took the supplement twice a month, rather than daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, ultimately, more trials are needed to corroborate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the aim of this research would not be to replace current disease-modifying drugs for MS but rather to provide another therapeutic option for patients who otherwise don't have access to the drugs, for example because of financial reasons, Thouvenot emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

While, build up of bad cholesterol in the arteries can lead to cardiac ailments and may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. There’s no denying that high levels of cholesterol may need medical intervention, but you will be amazed to know that there are certain spices that can work like a supporting remedy for effectively reducing bad cholesterol. Here’s all you need to know about this aromatic spice and 6 ways it can be used to lower LDL levels naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why cinnamon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon has the ability to help lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels due to its active compounds, such as cinnamaldehyde, which may enhance the body's ability to regulate cholesterol. Several studies suggest that cinnamon can improve lipid profiles by increasing antioxidant activity, reducing oxidative stress, and possibly influencing enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Moreover, cinnamon's anti-inflammatory properties may help reduce the inflammation associated with high LDL levels, contributing to a healthier cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting your day with a warm bowl of oatmeal is a heart-healthy choice, and adding a sprinkle of cinnamon can make it even more beneficial. Oats are known for their ability to lower LDL cholesterol, and cinnamon further enhances this effect. The combination of soluble fiber from oats and the anti-inflammatory properties of cinnamon helps reduce cholesterol buildup and improve heart health. Simply stir in half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to your oatmeal for a delicious, cholesterol-lowering breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon Tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon tea is an easy and soothing way to incorporate cinnamon into your daily routine. To make cinnamon tea, simply steep a cinnamon stick in hot water for about 10 minutes, or use ground cinnamon to brew a cup of tea. Regular consumption of cinnamon tea can help improve your lipid profile by lowering LDL cholesterol levels and increasing HDL (good cholesterol) levels. Drinking cinnamon tea daily as part of your morning or afternoon routine can provide consistent benefits over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoothies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoothies are a popular way to pack in nutrients, and adding cinnamon to your blend can make it even healthier. Combining cinnamon with ingredients like spinach, berries, and flaxseeds not only boosts the antioxidant content but also helps reduce LDL cholesterol. The polyphenols in cinnamon, along with the heart-healthy fats from ingredients like avocado or almond butter, work together to improve cholesterol balance. A teaspoon of cinnamon in your smoothie is a simple and tasty way to support heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon in whole-grain baked goods like muffins, bread, and pancakes. Whole grains, like oats and whole wheat flour, are known for their ability to lower LDL cholesterol, and cinnamon enhances this effect with its antioxidant properties. Whether in banana bread or healthy cookies, adding a teaspoon of cinnamon can turn your baked goods into a cholesterol-lowering treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt or Cereal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a quick and easy way to consume cinnamon, simply sprinkle it over your morning yogurt or cereal. Greek yogurt, rich in probiotics, paired with cinnamon can improve your gut health and help lower cholesterol levels. If you’re having cereal, opt for whole-grain varieties, and add a pinch of cinnamon to the top. This not only boosts the flavor but also helps regulate LDL cholesterol levels over time. It’s a simple, hassle-free way to incorporate cinnamon into your daily meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy Fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon can be especially effective at reducing LDL cholesterol when combined with healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, seeds, and olive oil. For example, adding cinnamon to a handful of almonds or sprinkling it over avocado toast can help enhance the cholesterol-lowering effects. Almonds, walnuts, and chia seeds contain heart-healthy fats that work synergistically with cinnamon to improve your cholesterol profile. This combination not only helps reduce LDL but also promotes overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>These Supplements Promise To Lower Blood Sugar And Help You Lose Weight—But Do They Work? - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFB6RjZRNU9iRHJpM2xnRVF0MFVETU5HSnNfUGcwV0t6RzdBTmZKTXE5NFBuUDMyTHBJR29BRkx1c3pNbUZfY3JZOHQtdFhpdU05VklTX19LVGJELTI5QVBXeEdqXy13RW9YTGo0TmlscEl0cXA1SVgzdmdMcWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Are Insulin Resistance Supplements Legit?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Kseniya Ovchinnikova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a46052847/taylor-swift-eras-tour-training-workouts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Taylor Swift during her Eras Tour;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Taylor Swift during her Eras Tour&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62230472/natural-glp-supplement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss supplements&lt;/a&gt; are everywhere right now—and that includes insulin resistance supps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplement companies market insulin resistance supplements to help &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64245012/walking-blood-sugar-management-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower your blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, curb glucose spikes, support consistent energy levels, combat sugar cravings, and help you maintain a healthy weight.

And what’s even in them? Ahead, experts break down how these supps work, and whether you should take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do insulin resistance supplements work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, an insulin resistance supplement would help support insulin sensitivity. “Insulin sensitivity can be looked at as the amount of insulin required to push sugar/carbs into cells to make energy,” explains endocrinologist Rekha Kumar, MD. “More sensitivity means it requires less insulin, and insulin resistance means it takes more insulin to turn carbs to energy.” This balance is vital for keeping healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, these supplements are designed to help combat a range of health issues. “Poor insulin sensitivity—insulin resistance—can lead to high blood sugar and lipids, which increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease,” says Christoph Buettner, MD, PhD, chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance supplements are a pretty broad category, so they all work in different ways. Most of them have a range of ingredients that don’t tend to overlap, although there are a few that show up repeatedly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitter Melon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few small studies suggest that the fruit extract bitter melon may help with lowering blood sugar levels. One randomized controlled trial of 90 people with type 2 diabetes found that levels of HbA1c (which measures average blood sugar levels over two to three months) didn’t change between the bitter melon and placebo groups after 12 weeks, per 2020 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920302491" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Complementary Therapies in Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

One 2023 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01057-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diabetology &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diabetology &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of existing research concluded that cinnamon could be an “add-on treatment” to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62224378/the-impossibility-of-getting-a-pcos-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another four-week randomized controlled trial of 18 people with prediabetes and obesity found that blood sugar levels were “significantly lower” when people had cinnamon beforehand, according to 2024 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000291652400008X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded that cinnamon may improve blood glucose control for those with obesity-related prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But none of the research on these ingredients is robust, making it tough to say for sure that the supplements do what they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, can insulin resistance supps actually improve your blood sugar and help you lose weight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are some pretty hefty promises, and experts are wary of them, especially because they haven’t been evaluated by the FDA. “There are no good studies or scientific evidence to show they make any dramatic difference,” in your blood sugar and weight, says Mir Ali, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, insulin sensitivity is a complicated process, and taking a supplement alone is unlikely to make a huge difference in your blood sugar and weight, adds integrative and functional medicine dietitian Lindsay Malone, RD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sure-fire way to improve your blood sugar and maintain your weight? Lifestyle changes: “No supplement will work unless you do,” Malone says. “Switching to a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a39628652/80-20-diet-low-glycemic-intermittent-fasting-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-glycemic diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-glycemic diet&lt;/a&gt;, eating whole, minimally processed foods, moving your body throughout the day, and getting &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63941290/blue-light-sleep-health-benefits-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adequate sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; will address and fix the root cause of insulin resistance.” Reducing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a27378711/weight-loss-success-story-simple-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:simple carbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;simple carbs&lt;/a&gt; like baked goods, soda, and cereal, for instance, can also help to keep your blood sugar levels stable, since your body breaks them down into glucose which could cause blood sugar spikes, Kumar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which supplements are best for insulin resistance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aren’t really on board with taking these new, buzzy, multi-ingredient supplements that claim to help with insulin resistance. However, a few vitamin and mineral supplements &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have some inherent benefits for insulin resistance and even weight loss, especially in people with endocrine or hormonal disorders like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11668966/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PCOS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PCOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts stress that these supplements are not magic pills. “Supplements alone are not a cure and often they do not do much,” Buettner says. But, again, with lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and regular movement, they may help support your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how they work, according to Malone:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carnitine. &lt;/strong&gt;Commonly sold as l-carnitine, this &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60956813/amino-acid-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amino acid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt; helps your body use fat for energy, which can support weight loss efforts and may improve insulin sensitivity, according to Malone. In a 2020 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Nutrition ESPEN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Nutrition ESPEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 37 randomized controlled clinical trials, l-carnitine supplementation significantly decreased body weight, but there were no major effects on waist circumference or body fat percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Omega-3;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Omega-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These healthy fats can reduce inflammation and “may also improve insulin sensitivity and assist with fat loss, especially belly fat,” Malone says. One small 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815739/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrición Hospitalaria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutrición Hospitalaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that omega-3 supplements “augmented” belly fat loss in overweight or obese people who were also on a weight loss diet, but more research is needed to determine whether omega-3 supplementation is effective for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40120300/vitamin-d-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “Low vitamin D levels are linked to insulin resistance, so supplementing with vitamin D can help improve sensitivity and potentially support weight loss,” Malone says. There’s a link between taking vitamin D and weight loss, as part of a larger treatment plan like a changed diet, per a 2018 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246883/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Endocrinology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Endocrinology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2021 study in the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07315724.2021.1902879" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Nutrition Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the American Nutrition Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acetyl-L-Carnitine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005P0UYGA?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64254355%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$27.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$27.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Omega-3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GCU6KA?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64254355%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$12.29 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$12.29 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U3Y8OM?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64254355%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$10.22 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$10.22 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned about insulin resistance, it’s best to talk to a healthcare provider. (And if you have severe insulin resistance, like you’re prediabetic or you have type 2 diabetes, Kumar says you may benefit from prescription medication like metformin or a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63788221/glp1-alcohol-use-disorder-clinical-trial-results/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GLP-1 receptor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GLP-1 receptor&lt;/a&gt; agonist like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62777117/running-while-on-ozempic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doc can do an evaluation to see where things stand with your blood sugar levels, including testing to see if you have prediabetes or diabetes. From there, you can come up with a care plan together. So, while the idea of taking an insulin resistance supplement and hoping things will turn around is easy and appealing, it’s always best to rope in a medical professional for extra help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:32:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFB6RjZRNU9iRHJpM2xnRVF0MFVETU5HSnNfUGcwV0t6RzdBTmZKTXE5NFBuUDMyTHBJR29BRkx1c3pNbUZfY3JZOHQtdFhpdU05VklTX19LVGJELTI5QVBXeEdqXy13RW9YTGo0TmlscEl0cXA1SVgzdmdMcWw</guid></item><item><title>What WWII data tells us about children, added sugar and chronic disease - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxONjF6V2wwU3JHeHZmcmllekxlVU16allraVZ1V255U1l1UHpOWklaSmpzWngzVUh1Wld0Z2NXSDNyY1NWQURQb1RUdkQ5VXNxbWNsZmVidlVNMTFsTWZLWDBNY3g5bXdvakV5dUVoTUJoZGxLUThlSk9xOUxtdlZUS0xkR2dpQTlyZm52U204Q3Q4Ykx2S3RB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="72SW5QUKZJFULGXKNEQWIJQGXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s hard to escape the fruit snacks-juice box culture many parents and children live in.

			&lt;p&gt;For roughly one in every hundred people, food containing even the smallest amounts of gluten can deliver a gutful of hurt and pose severe risks to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a domino effect of immunological reactions can be traced back to their &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/celiac-disease/genetic-testing-for-celiac-disease"&gt;genetic roots&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/evidence-emerges-that-a-viral-infection-could-be-behind-celiac-disease"&gt;number of contributing factors&lt;/a&gt; are also involved, making it difficult to map the precise chain of events that causes celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using transgenic mice, an international team led by scientists from McMaster University in Canada has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnuKJhhfBT8"&gt;identified a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; played by the very cells making up the gut's lining, describing a major stepping stone that could lead to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnuKJhhfBT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder triggered by the presence of a group of structural proteins known as gluten in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gluten-food-list"&gt;Eating virtually anything&lt;/a&gt; made with wheat, barley, or rye – meaning most baked goods, breads, and pastas – puts &lt;a href="https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/symptoms-of-celiac-disease/"&gt;people with the condition&lt;/a&gt; at risk of transient symptoms like bloating, pain, diarrhea, constipation, and sometimes reflux and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the only way to avoid the symptoms is to avoid the foods that trigger them. Over the longer term, immune attacks triggered by gluten can &lt;a target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00006/full" delay="150" data-sk="tooltip_parent" navigationtraceid="T02Q5MRL9-to-Thread:thread" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00006/full" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;damage the small intestine's villi&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;"This is difficult to do, and experts agree that a gluten-free diet is insufficient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 90 percent of people diagnosed with the condition carry a pair of genes that encode for a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQ2"&gt;HLA-DQ2.5&lt;/a&gt;. Of the remaining 10 percent, most have a similar protein called HLA-DQ8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other kinds of 'HLA' (or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"&gt;human leukocyte antigen&lt;/a&gt;) proteins, the proteins hold pieces of fallen invaders aloft like macabre trophies on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell"&gt;class of immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, warning other defensive tissues to be on the lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the specific case of HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8, the proteins are shaped to hold chunks of gluten peptide that are resistant to digestion, instructing murderous T cells to go on the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these instructions aren't the clearest at distinguishing between a threat and similar-looking materials in our body, meaning those with the genes are at risk of a variety of autoimmune conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145310" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PastaInBowlAndOnAFork642.jpg" alt="Eating pasta" class="size-full wp-image-145310" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PastaInBowlAndOnAFork642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PastaInBowlAndOnAFork642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PastaInBowlAndOnAFork642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 proteins are shaped to hold chunks of gluten peptide that are resistant to digestion. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD-UOJuJkI/"&gt;pixelshot/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coeliac.org.uk/information-and-support/coeliac-disease/about-coeliac-disease/causes/genetics/"&gt;Not everybody&lt;/a&gt; who expresses either HLA-DQ2.5 or HLA-DQ8 will develop an immune disorder like celiac disease, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that to happen, those torn-up pieces of gluten first need to be carried across the gut wall by a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_transglutaminase"&gt;transporting enzyme&lt;/a&gt; that binds with the peptide and alters it in ways to make it even more recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells in the intestinal wall are responsible for releasing this transporting enzyme into the gut, so they clearly have a critical role in the early stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also known to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"&gt;express the family of proteins&lt;/a&gt; to which HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 belong, which are typically regulated by inflammatory responses in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What hasn't been clear is how this staging ground for people with celiac disease actually functions within the pathology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145312" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PersonHoldingWheatAndStomach642.jpg" alt="Hands on a stomach, with one holding wheat" class="size-full wp-image-145312" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PersonHoldingWheatAndStomach642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PersonHoldingWheatAndStomach642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PersonHoldingWheatAndStomach642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145312" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Currently the only way to avoid the symptoms is to avoid the foods that trigger them. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEpNqvTdV0/"&gt;AndreyPopov/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To focus on this important link in the chain, the research team double-checked the expression of the major immune complex in the cells lining the intestines of people with treated and untreated celiac disease, and in mice with the human genes for HLA-DQ2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then created functional living models of the gut, called an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid"&gt;organoid&lt;/a&gt;, using the mouse intestinal cells, to study the expression of their immune proteins up close, subjecting them to inflammatory triggers as well as predigested and intact gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This allowed us to narrow down the specific cause and effect and prove exactly whether and how the reaction takes place," &lt;a href="https://brighterworld.mcmaster.ca/articles/celiac-origin-of-gluten-immune-reaction/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McMasters biomedical engineer Tohid Didar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this it became evident the cells lining the gut weren't just passive bystanders suffering collateral damage in a misguided effort to rid the body of gluten – they were key agents, presenting a mash-up of gluten fragments broken down by gut bacteria and transporting enzymes to gluten-specific immune cells firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the types of tissue involved and their enhancement by the presence of inflammatory microbes gives researchers a new list of targets for future treatments, potentially allowing millions of people worldwide to enjoy a gluten-filled pastry or two without the risk of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal formation is a group of brain regions, including the hippocampus and some other structures closely connected to it. This set of brain regions is known to support various important brain functions, including the consolidation of memories, experience-based reasoning, decision-making and spatial navigation (i.e., the ability to map and navigate specific environments).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Most past neuroscience studies have focused on how the hippocampus supports &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/episodic+memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;episodic memory&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., the memory of personal experiences or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/life+events/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life events&lt;/a&gt;) and spatial navigation. Yet recent findings suggest that this brain region also contributes to what is known as compositional memory, which entails 'breaking down' memories into fundamental building blocks and reassembling these blocks to form new memories or predict future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at University of Oxford, University College London and other institutes recently carried out a study aimed at shedding further light on how the hippocampus supports this breaking down and re-purposing of memories, using a combination of computer simulations and brain activity recordings. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01908-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the hippocampus helps to shape future behavior via two connected processes, known as memory composition and hippocampal replay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The hippocampus is critical for memory, imagination and constructive reasoning," wrote Jacob J. W. Bakermans, Joseph Warren and their colleagues in their paper. "Recent models have suggested that its neuronal responses can be well explained by state spaces that model the transitions between experiences. We use simulations and hippocampal recordings to reconcile these views."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Previous studies found that the consolidation of memories could be supported by a process known as hippocampal replay. In other words, they suggested that neurons in the hippocampus 'replay' memories of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/past+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;past experiences&lt;/a&gt;, especially during sleep or while resting, to facilitate learning and help us remember things for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their recent work, Bakermans, Warren and their colleagues explored the possibility that hippocampal state spaces (i.e., mathematical models of how experiences are represented in the hippocampus) are compositional in nature. The brain could thus selectively use and re-arrange specific parts of our memories of experiences, known as primitives, to imagine or predict possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We show that if state spaces are constructed compositionally from existing building blocks, or primitives, hippocampal responses can be interpreted as compositional memories, binding these primitives together," wrote the researchers. "Critically, this enables agents to behave optimally in new environments with no new learning, inferring behavior directly from the composition."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, the researchers also suggest that the replay of memories by neurons in the hippocampus contributes to the consolidation of compositional memories. Instead of being a passive memory process, as suggested by some previous works, hippocampal replay could actively support the formation of flexible memories that can be later broken apart and used to inform future behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We predict a role for hippocampal replay in building and consolidating these compositional memories," wrote the researchers. "We test these predictions in two datasets by showing that replay events from newly discovered landmarks induce and strengthen new remote firing fields. When the landmark is moved, replay builds a new firing field at the same vector to the new location. Together, these findings provide a framework for reasoning about compositional memories and demonstrate that such memories are formed in hippocampal replay."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent study by Bakermans, Warren and their colleagues offers a new perspective on how the hippocampus allows humans to use their past experiences to make predictions or imagine new scenarios. In the future, it could inspire more research aimed at testing the idea proposed by the researchers, potentially helping to paint a clearer picture of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hippocampus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; that coherently unifies its different functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Kwesi Pratt Jr, the Managing Editor of the Insight Newspaper, has urged government to employ a balanced policy to protect the Achimota forest which happens to be the only carbon sink in the Greater Accra Region.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Speaking to the dangers it poses to the lives of inhabitants of Accra on Pan African TV on March 22, 2025, he lamented the ongoing devastation of the Achimota forest under the guise that owners of the land occasionally approach government for certain arrangements in the interest of their family.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Every now and then they’ll come and tell us that some family owns it and that the family is demanding it and so they are going into some agreement with the family. Let that family go to hell! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Because it’s our lives we are talking about. The lives of 4 million people are at stake. The lives of 4 million people cannot be sacrificed for the so-called interest of the family of that land which has become the Achimota forest,” he said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He emphasized that successive governments since the 1970s have not shown any commitment in protecting the forest reserve. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The whole of Accra has only one carbon sink, which is the Achimota Forest. From the 1970s when I became conscious of the Achimota forest, there hasn’t been any government and I mean any government that has seen the Achimota Forest for what it is. I mean as a carbon sink; something which keeps us alive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Now, if you’re conscious of the consequences of environmental degradation and so on, you will not be doing what government after government have been doing to the Achimota Forest”, he lamented.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He indicated that the Achimota forest, similar to other natural resources can only be protected if the state does not see it as a resource to be exploited for private profit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“We must get this clear. It is only possible to protect the Achimota forest if we see it as a property that is necessary for the survival of over 4 million people. If you continue to see it as something that can be exploited for private profit you get it wrong. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“So, our minerals, our rivers and our forests and so on should not be exploited simply for private profits. It should be exploited reasonably in a balanced policy which recognizes that these are essential for our live for the quality of lives for over 32 million people,” he added.&lt;br&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I never thought in 2025, we would be looking at this resurgence of measles,” said Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;. “And I didn’t know it’d be in my backyard, either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;On Thursday, several other states reported updates on measles. Ohio reported its first case of 2025 and Maryland announced two new cases. Both states have linked the cases to international travel. Alabama also &lt;a href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/blog/2025/03/nr-20.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that an unvaccinated child with measles traveled through the state, while Kansas has &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; eight cases of measles among children this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="062fb919-d779-45f0-80e7-a7df27622a80" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Measles outbreak: how contagious is it and what are the symptoms?","elementId":"062fb919-d779-45f0-80e7-a7df27622a80","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/28/measles-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine-explainer"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles cases have also been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world,” Lucia Donatelli, chief of Maryland’s Center for Immunization, told reporters on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It can linger in the air for up to two hours after the person leaves the room, so it is highly transmissible. And the best way that we have to prevent measles is by vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in international cases comes soon after the US government laid off and put on leave thousands of USAID employees and contractors, many of whom worked in countries with high rates of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But the highly contagious virus is also on the rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There were 285 cases of measles reported in the US last year. So far, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;378&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases in the first few months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;309 of those cases&lt;/a&gt; are in Texas, which has had 40 hospitalizations and one death of an unvaccinated six-year-old girl from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The outbreak has spread to New Mexico, where 42 cases, two hospitalizations, and one death of an unvaccinated adult have been &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also spread to Oklahoma, which has &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; four probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Officials suspect the true number of cases is higher; typically, there are one to two deaths per 1,000 cases. The under-reporting means “we’re not at a point where we know where all of our cases are”, Wells says, which makes it challenging to stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Families with multiple cases may not get everyone tested. And “there’s some hesitancy in interacting with the medical community”, Wells says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The vast majority of cases are among people who have not been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s a lot of vaccine hesitancy in Gaines county, which is where the majority of the cases are,” Wells says. There’s social pressure against getting vaccinated and misinformation has taken root over the past two decades, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The parents of the child who died appeared in a &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-parents-of-child-in-texas-measles-outbreak-death/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on Monday with Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We would absolutely not take the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt;,” said the girl’s mother, referring to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. “The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it,” she said of her four other children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s not as bad as the media is making it out to be,” the father said through a translator. Both parents fought back tears throughout the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy has shied away from directly recommending vaccinations during this outbreak while also promoting alternative treatments. He has also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the Texas child was unhealthy or malnourished, despite medical reports that she was healthy and had no underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="81795a62-557d-4baa-ae8a-6ac3e2e55b01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Wake-up call’: Measles cases doubled in Europe last year, say WHO and Unicef","elementId":"81795a62-557d-4baa-ae8a-6ac3e2e55b01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/13/wake-up-call-measles-cases-doubled-europe-last-year-who-unicef"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Health departments in cities like Lubbock, where the hospitalized children with measles are being treated, have created mass vaccination clinics where anyone can get the MMR vaccine free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re trying to remove every single barrier to get vaccinated,” Wells says. “And then we’re working more with messaging from trusted leaders about the importance of vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But so far, the Lubbock clinic has only given out about 300 more vaccines than they usually would over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Without widespread vaccination, the outbreak could continue for another year, she says. Other recent outbreaks have been in densely populated areas, but these cases are spread over 11 counties in Texas, plus New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We have a large, spread-out population where we’re going to keep seeing measles pop up,” Wells says. “It’s going to take a lot of time to change the perception of vaccines, get people vaccinated, and then get to a point where there won’t be any vulnerable people left for measles to find.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;From the first two cases, Wells knew “this is going to be big”. Two children hospitalized in Lubbock tested positive, which meant there was more community spread happening under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Now, she worries about someone stopping at one of the major rest stops along Texas highways and spreading measles far beyond the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That’s how easily transmissible measles is,” Wells says – and outbreaks can ignite anywhere that the vaccination rate is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In Ohio, an unvaccinated resident tested positive for measles after international travel, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/health-director-announces-measles-case-in-ohio" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the state department of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Maryland officials also announced two more cases of measles in unvaccinated international travelers. They flew into Dulles international airport on 5 March – the same day as the previous case in Maryland, though at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These cases are not associated with that previous case or with the measles outbreak in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, Maryland health officials &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These patients, who traveled internationally together, also visited several locations throughout the Washington DC area, including four visits to a healthcare center as well as trips to the metro, a shuttle bus at National airport, and a car dealership, over the course of 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If patients suspect they were exposed to measles, they should seek care immediately – but it’s very important to notify healthcare providers of potential measles cases, so that others in the facility don’t get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Call ahead to tell the place where you are going to, to tell the provider where you are going to, that you’re coming in because you may have possibly been exposed to measles,” Donatelli says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That way, the provider can go ahead and make the proper arrangements so that you could be seen safely and quickly – and at the same time, they can protect other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOa2tyMEVPbmVzNDdZdUVZdVpSMzRIM0p1NF84QkhYdFRBZkJmN1VBbEhkTi1Fck1pQk5ndGVoWUlGdTRiSnk1OGFrN3dxWVozQjBOdkJzRGw3eHdIRGxtXzI0Wm44b2I4Q0dOT0d6OTRxcGFqYjlwV3BGVUEyWjVoTFZRelAyYmNvMEREVUl3</guid></item><item><title>The dangers of too much protein and which type is healthiest - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQOEpyTk82NHdsX2dhWGNuRkhPVVRVa1BqMDREdWd6T0c4b1hSZGI2bFFUcUtHUlVfeFVkeEVXeFFsVWljQmFFR2lWSzNVQWUtWGdEdVdSODFvTmlYX3J5LUU5M0NyRVJyQXVCelZvb1BjdWVjc3dTYnRoQ2dtcVJrLUVTbW8wbzZOaktyVEg0VHh5SkpHeUMzdnNnM2xXNUhDVVd4RHhnX0kxenhPTVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, many people taking supplemented forms of protein, such as shakes &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/leisure/fitness/best-protein-bars/"&gt;and bars&lt;/a&gt;, may be wasting their time and money, as the body cannot store protein. Instead, the protein is broken down into amino acids which are excreted if not used, or in the case of high protein diets the body converts excess protein to glucose which is stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re going all out on having everything enriched with or fortified with protein and are not very active or doing a lot of strength and muscle building then you may be getting too much for your body to utilise, and it will pass out down the toilet,” says Thornton-Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the risks of eating too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is an essential nutrient found throughout the body, not just in muscle but in bone, skin, hair, and every other tissue. It makes up the enzymes that create biochemical reactions and the haemoglobin that carries oxygen in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are few risks of having too much protein per se. Indeed, an analysis by Harvard University which followed 130,000 people for up to 32 years, found that the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, research indicates that the form the protein comes in (the protein package) rather than the amount is more likely to make a difference to health. For example, a high protein diet which relies on &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/why-healthy-brain-requires-meaty-diet/"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; may also contain high levels of saturated fat, while a diet reliant on powders and bars will likely include a lot of processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Navarra in Spain reported that certain animal-based sources of protein could cause higher levels of inflammation than foods like legumes, nuts, and beans. They found that obese people on diets who got more of their protein from meat had higher levels of inflammation compared to participants who consumed mostly fish or plant-based sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, another &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483052/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 2,061 participants found that overall inflammation and oxidative stress increased less in those with the highest protein intake than in those with the lowest. The study concluded that dietary protein, particularly from plant sources, may be associated with beneficial changes in the inflammatory burden in ageing populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Heart problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research conducted at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, part of Harvard University, found that eating regular small amounts of red meat, especially processed red meat, is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. Another 2010 &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2946797/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analysed data on the dietary habits and health outcomes of 84,136 women and concluded that high red meat intake increases risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and that the risk may be reduced by changing to other sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, the culprit is not volume, but the type of protein being consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Thornton-Wood explains: “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; is linked to overconsumption of red meat and to consumption of too much processed meat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that consumption of processed meat is carcinogenic and that consumption of red meat is “probably carcinogenic to humans”. Thornton-Woods adds that eating protein at the expense of other nutritious foods like the fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, may also carry risks.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike traditional treatments, this compound addresses blood sugar levels while simultaneously targeting obesity-related issues, marking a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed through rigorous university research, HPH-15 uniquely activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

Additionally, it produced equal or reduced lactic acid levels compared to metformin, lowering the risk of lactic acidosis, a troublesome side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies further supported these findings.

Levels decreased from 11.1 mmol/L to as low as 7.9 mmol/L, even at minimal doses, rivaling results from high-dose metformin treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, HPH-15 provided notable protection against obesity complications, significantly reducing fat accumulation and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/new-fatty-liver-disease-treatment-could-save-millions-of-people-worldwide/"&gt;liver fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;. Treated mice showed an impressive 44% reduction in subcutaneous fat, emphasizing the compound’s potential to combat obesity-linked health problems effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This compound holds transformative potential for diabetes treatment, offering benefits beyond blood sugar regulation,” noted Professor Mikako Fujita from the Faculty of Life Sciences at Kumamoto University. The research, published in the prestigious journal &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-024-06260-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Diabetologia&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizes the multifaceted impact of HPH-15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most critical findings involves the compound’s antifibrotic properties. Liver fibrosis is a common complication in patients with type 2 diabetes, often exacerbated by fat accumulation and chronic inflammation. HPH-15’s ability to reduce fibrosis adds another layer of therapeutic value, setting it apart from existing medications like metformin. These effects could address unmet needs for individuals at risk of severe liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety remains a top priority in diabetes treatment. While metformin has long been a standard therapy, its use is sometimes limited due to side effects, including &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-new-era-of-genome-editing-has-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lactic acidosis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, HPH-15’s lower production of lactic acid suggests a safer profile, particularly for patients with underlying health conditions. The compound’s ability to activate AMPK and reduce glucose levels without excessive lactic acid production could represent a safer alternative for a broader range of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract showing HPH-15's performance versus Metformin across various metrics.

This positions it as a versatile tool in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-can-improve-brain-function-and-protect-against-diabetes-and-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;combating diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and its complications,” they explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend beyond individual patients. Type 2 diabetes is a growing global epidemic, contributing to substantial healthcare costs and reduced quality of life for millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatment options often focus narrowly on blood glucose levels, leaving other issues like obesity and liver damage inadequately addressed. HPH-15’s multifunctional benefits could redefine diabetes care by offering a holistic approach to managing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="what_is_metformin_"&gt;What is Metformin?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin, a medication with roots tracing back hundreds of years, was initially derived from the herb Galega officinalis, traditionally used in Europe for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/why-did-human-brains-grow-so-big-the-surprising-link-to-our-gut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;digestive&lt;/a&gt; and urinary health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Lipid level assessment by Oil Red O staining of HepG2 cells treated with HPH-15 or metformin for 16 h followed by exposure to 100 mmol/l d-(+)-glucose for 1 day; the cells were observed using a microscope.

However, concerns over phenformin’s severe side effects and the discovery of insulin overshadowed these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fda-approved-diabetes-drug-significantly-slows-down-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; was rediscovered and approved in Europe in the 1950s as a diabetes treatment, gaining FDA approval in the United States in 1995. Today, it is a cornerstone treatment for people with diabetes who cannot manage their blood sugar through lifestyle changes alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond managing blood sugar, metformin offers additional benefits for individuals with diabetes, including improved cardiovascular health, reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease, and modest weight loss. These advantages have positioned metformin as one of the most prescribed diabetes medications worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also explored its off-label uses, noting its effectiveness in conditions like prediabetes, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, it has shown promise in mitigating &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/popular-weight-loss-drug-could-reduce-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; caused by antipsychotic medications, further expanding its clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;HPH-15's performance versus Metformin in muscle, epididymal fat and liver.

Studies suggest it may reduce the risk of cancers such as breast, colon, and prostate cancer in those with type 2 diabetes. Metformin has also been linked to a slower rate of cognitive decline, a lower risk of dementia, and fewer strokes in diabetic populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascinatingly, early studies indicate that metformin might slow aging, prevent age-related diseases, and even increase lifespan by enhancing insulin sensitivity, providing antioxidant effects, and improving vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most studies on metformin have focused on individuals with diabetes or &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-reveal-strong-connection-between-zinc-levels-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prediabetes&lt;/a&gt;, leaving uncertainty about whether these potential benefits extend to the broader population. Ongoing research aims to clarify its impact on non-diabetic individuals and determine whether its unique effects could revolutionize preventative health care and anti-aging therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, further research is necessary before HPH-15 can be introduced as a standard treatment. Clinical trials involving human participants will be critical to confirm its efficacy and safety. Nevertheless, these early results mark an important step forward in the fight against diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to explore the compound’s potential, HPH-15 offers hope for improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life for those living with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 11:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNZ3VyZjYzcWVJeUFVSk5NTHdFT1UtdGxTVHMtRzcyR2FxWlh2Qy1EWEZTdGV4elZoZFdjWHRyZnpMQ2xZWllTS0lmaXhYMDI2N0tQcGN3ZF9vbWF2eGJxQk9hTGxwQTk5YWxnTmJMOHJQOXY1UHU0ZHpoY3A2Yzc1RGlwZVQwcC05WnpnbVV4MUNhRmZhMzlFWnNLTmlfV0l6UXZjYg</guid></item><item><title>Man, 48, diagnosed with stage four cancer reveals the one common symptom he initially ignored - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPTnNkOUZJLWZwZVRRaTJnM2dya3UzQklKX3RjRFN6dFQzRjFyTk9Gck1rT0Q2b0E2bWozZXExRGxTUW4tb0QtSTFzZVdvdGdTdWZYUV8yT09FdEtZeXdDVllVQmZ1V3NxcDdYbHExV0h3US00VWFwZm5tM3lsZjRqQWYzd1BfVS1EekowVzU2SVNHVnhadktWcmFiRFY1SXExODVuampoUjdSYTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This article contains discussion of cancer which some readers may find distressing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A man was stunned to be told he had cancer and that it was spreading to other organs after only experiencing one symptom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Shawn Michael, 48, from Springfield &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, has opened up about his &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; story in a video that has gone viral on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He shared his diagnosis on The Patient Story's &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel last month and the video has so far amassed almost 100,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Medics eventually diagnosed Michael with stage four colorectal cancer and told him it had begun spreading to some of his other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Despite this, he and his doctors remain optimistic he can beat his cancer diagnosis due to his age as well as his general good &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the diagnosis was quite a surprise to Michael and his family as he was only dealing with one relatively common symptom beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Shawn Michael shared his story in a now viral video (YouTube/The Patient Story)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;After experiencing some bowel issues in October last year, the 48-year-old believed he was suffering from constipation but hadn’t yet found anything to effectively relieve himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Finding no help from over-the-counter remedies he sought help from an urgent care center that gave him what he described as ‘napalm for your intestines’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This did relieve his symptoms, however, Michael explained that he still felt something was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Opening up about his story, he said: “Two days later I could still physically feel something inside of me. It hurt so bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Michael was told he needed immediate surgery when a cancerous mass was discovered (YouTube/The Patient Story)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Returning to urgent care he had a CT scan, and it revealed a mass in his colon and he was informed that he needed immediate surgery to remove the blockage. Doctors also found other concerning masses but there had been some positive news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;During the operation, they removed a large part of his colon and found several very large cancer-like tumors on his omentum, a large layer of fatty tissue that wraps around the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Michael added: “[The surgeon] explained that the obstruction that was in my colon at the time was so large he was absolutely shocked that it hadn't ruptured yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“That was actually kind of a lucky break that it had attached to that fatty tissue there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“That had been able to help slow down the progression to the other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While the initial operation was considered a success and doctors removed all the cancer they could find, some remains in his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Michael is now set to undergo chemotherapy for three months in hopes of killing off the remainder of the cancer and remains hopeful for his eventual recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt; If you’ve been affected by any of these issues and want to speak to someone in confidence, contact the American Cancer Society on 1-800-227-2345 or via their &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/online-help/contact-us.html#:~:text=Call%20us%20at%201%2D800%2D227%2D2345&amp;amp;text=Ask%20us%20how%20you%20can,patient%2Drelated%20programs%20or%20resources"&gt;&lt;em&gt;live chat feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;available 24/7 every day of the year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 11:46:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPTnNkOUZJLWZwZVRRaTJnM2dya3UzQklKX3RjRFN6dFQzRjFyTk9Gck1rT0Q2b0E2bWozZXExRGxTUW4tb0QtSTFzZVdvdGdTdWZYUV8yT09FdEtZeXdDVllVQmZ1V3NxcDdYbHExV0h3US00VWFwZm5tM3lsZjRqQWYzd1BfVS1EekowVzU2SVNHVnhadktWcmFiRFY1SXExODVuampoUjdSYTQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
