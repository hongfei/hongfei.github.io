            Making &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/exercise-recommendations-workout-quiz-wellness/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; fun is the holy grail for many people who can’t quite find the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/sport/london-marathon-running-spt-intl"&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt; to work out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct68fcv0000356mqqowwdbc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But rather than forcing yourself to enjoy running or that gym class you once attended, the solution may lie in something more straightforward — simply matching a workout to your personality type, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1587472/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6bbjs0006356mwfvvl1gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s because people with different personality traits enjoy different types of exercise, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6dmd90009356mau78elt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More extroverted people, for example, prefer high-intensity training sessions with others, such as team sports, while people who scored highly on “neuroticism,” a metric that measures someone’s emotional instability, preferred private workouts without people watching them and punctuated by short breaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6dtzl000c356m6spz1fdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for those who scored highly on conscientiousness, they “were more likely to have a well-rounded fitness … and we think that’s because conscientious individuals are more likely to be driven by the fact that exercise is good for them,” said the study’s co-lead author, Flaminia Ronca, an associate professor in exercise science at University College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6e0e0000f356mhyrknkc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Personality determines which intensities and forms of exercises we’re attracted to. … If we can understand that, then we can make that first step in engagement and exercise in sedentary individuals,” she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6f4mc000i356mh58fc80x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings have important implications for encouraging more people to exercise, especially since just 22.5% of adults and 19% of adolescents worldwide manage the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization-recommended&lt;/a&gt; 150 minutes of physical activity per week, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6ffx3000n356m3fbozy1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By focusing on personality types, health care providers may be able to offer a “more personalized approach to exercise,” said Angelina Sutin, a professor at Florida State University who specializes in investigating links between personality and health, and who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6fqzh000q356mwsth2b0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Typically … we tell people to exercise and just say: ‘We know high-intensity interval training is good for you, so you should do it,’” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6g7k8000t356m08kzz03z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But for people high in neuroticism, they’re not going to do it, and we also know that low-intensity exercise can be beneficial too. Knowing that somebody is high in neuroticism, recommending that kind of exercise, maybe people will be more likely to engage in it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6gcfx000w356mmea0y3vf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also important to note that personality traits interact with each other, Ronca added. Some people score highly on both neuroticism and conscientiousness, meaning that although they may find exercise anxiety-inducing, they are much more likely to do it since they know it is good for them, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6hakc000z356m9zdq8vpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To reach their findings, Ronca and her colleagues in London first directed the 132 study participants, aged between 25 and 51 years old, to complete a questionnaire revealing their personality traits.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6henz0012356m3zrwjy1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study employed a commonly used model that conceptualizes someone’s personality through five traits — extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6j1lm0017356mtat7iplm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Personality traits … they’re just descriptions of the way people behave in certain situations,” Paul Burgess, a professor of neuroscience at UCL who co-led the study, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6jqqm001a356mf5s98lgi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And the way that people behave in certain situations is determined to a large degree by their brain capabilities, what they notice, what they pay attention to, what they can remember, how fast they can react.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6jvca001d356me5yr0fm1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then ran fitness tests on the participants and randomly sorted them into two groups. One group was given an eight-week cycling and strength plan, while the control group&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;did 10 minutes a week of stretching exercises. Of the original 132 participants, 86 completed both pre- and post-testing either side of these eight weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6lcmn001g356murskf0jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study team found that, although fitness improved across all personality types for those who completed the cycling and strength program, there was a marked difference in enjoyment of the exercises. More extroverted people enjoyed the higher-intensity lab fitness tests, while more “neurotic” people enjoyed the home-based light-intensity sessions.

            Personality traits also informed how exercise influenced someone’s stress levels. People who scored highly in neuroticism had a significant reduction in self-reported stress, much more than in any other group, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Those who would benefit the most from a stress reduction are the ones who actually showed a decrease in stress following those eight weeks of exercise,” Ronca said. “And I think that’s quite a powerful message to give.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Given the many benefits of exercise, including stress reduction, both Ronca and Burgess hope their findings encourage people to find alternative ways of exercise outside the more traditional workouts they might dislike.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s a danger, perhaps, that the focus becomes … competitive sports and serious engagement at a time when young people are starting to have lots more demands on them,” Burgess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There are a lot of personalities that don’t respond well to that kind of situation, that find it quite stressful.”

But according to cardiologists, the real danger to your heart could be hiding in the patterns of your everyday life. From late-night snacking to endless screen time, skipped meals to excess salt, it’s our daily routines that may be damaging our cardiovascular health, regardless of age, gender, or body size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-1" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is commonly believed that heart disease occurs only in older or obviously unfit individuals. Actually, cardiovascular disease can accumulate over years, maybe in young, thin, or 'healthy-looking' people. Heritability, stress, and lifestyle are factors, and prevention is the way to go," Dr Vikrant Khese, Cardiologist, Apollo Clinic, Kharadi, tells Health Shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-2" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the incidence of heart-related conditions in individuals below 50 years of age, has seen a rise. This busts the myth that heart disease is only for older people or men, says Dr Nitin Bote, Interventional Cardiologist, K.J. Somaiya Hospital and Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are actually seeing an increasing number of young patients, including women, presenting with early symptoms of heart disease, caused by stress, lifestyle, and hormonal changes. Another myth is that if you take medication, lifestyle modifications are not required. This is very much not the case. Medication controls risk but long-term cardiac health relies on habit changes," adds Dr Bote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daily habits that affect heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the daily lifestyle habits that may silently raise cardiovascular risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadequate rest increases stress hormone levels and blood pressure, straining the heart. According to a 2010 study about sleep duration as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, there was an increased risk of Congenital Heart Disease in subjects with sustained 5 or fewer, 6, 7, and 9 hours or more, compared with those with 8 hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Excess screen time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spend hours on phones or in front of the TV, be mindful. Studies have found a correlation between excessive use of mobile phones and TV screens, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and ischaemic heart disease. This is because these activities promote a sedentary lifestyle, affecting circulation and movement, and thereby raising the risk of obesity, which is not good for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-7" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Constant late-night snacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a habit of late-night snacking can disrupt metabolism, impact insulin levels, and even add to weight and cholesterol issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-8" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Skipping meals or eating irregularly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bote, missing meals or consuming huge, irregular portions, can raise insulin levels and disrupt metabolic balance, indirectly impact &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/5-simple-ways-to-boost-your-cardiovascular-health-visual-story-11733739591540.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiovascular health"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Excess salt intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked threats for your heart? Salt. Both Dr Khese and Dr Bote, agree that excessive salt is one of the biggest risks for heart damage. "Through processed snack foods, restaurant meals, or what may be perceived as benign condiments, most individuals take in twice the daily recommended amount of sodium," says Dr Bote. Explaining the risks, Dr Khese adds, "Consuming salt in excess on a regular basis increases blood sodium concentrations that attract fluid into the blood vessels, causing them to swell. This is what increases blood pressure and causes the heart to work more forcefully, which can lead to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle), and eventually heart failure. Too much salt consumption also hardens arteries in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-11" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. High sugar and trans-fat consumption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take care of your heart? Give up or reduce sugary drinks, packaged snacks, and fried foods, which tend to increase inflammation and unhealthy cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-12" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Low intake of fibre, fruits, and vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of nutrient-dense foods means the body misses out on key antioxidants and heart-protective fibre. Your diet plays a key role in protecting your heart, so if you consume a high-trans fat diet with added sugar and red meat, with low fibre, fruit, and vegetable consumption, you may be inviting a cardiovascular risk, says Dr Khese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-13" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Physical inactivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even normal-weight individuals are at risk for unfavourable lipid profiles, hypertension, and insulin resistance if they are sedentary. Sedentary life affects circulation, causes inflammation, and promotes the development of plaque in the arteries, independent of body size. "Everyday physical movement, even just walking, can dramatically lower cardiovascular risk," asserts Dr Bote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-14" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Unmanaged chronic stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term emotional stress can elevate blood pressure and contribute to hormonal imbalances that affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-15" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Skipping routine medical check-ups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing preventive screenings can delay diagnosis of high blood pressure, cholesterol, or early-stage heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-16" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to improve your heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention is the best cure! So, making simple, sustainable shifts like eating more fibre, avoiding sugary beverages, sleeping well, managing stress, and even simply &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/how-walking-daily-improves-your-health-visual-story-11740563987461.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="walking"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; for 30 minutes daily — can dramatically reduce long-term heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-17" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular health check-ups, especially after the age of 30, are crucial to catch warning signs before they turn critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-18" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart disease is preventable in most cases. By being mindful of what we eat, staying physically active, managing stress, and getting enough sleep, we can protect our hearts from damage that builds silently over time," says Dr Bote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="end-of-story-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Mint</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:30:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxNRng2RGJtWm9zMW4xeS1reGtJNmxhanB5UEJ6QXVRbkpZdEl2dnV2dng4T0hhNzQ0UzZWM3Rtb3VWVm91OHVkaEVUVDlVSU9MRksxMENQNHlYRURMek5kc0l3VmliMW5MODMxaVQ1NlIxdU04MmprWTFvbEFlWnZ0TDlsTVNhdGNUb1dTRlRoVTNKU1RyS3N1SU42NFBROEpycy1oOVFwLUtWYjNSeS0yclpPb3pyak5zZll4WmxZWVZyZndQV2FUMlhaTExCeUZTWkR6YWgtTndfamR0SDZaRg</guid></item><item><title>咳嗽药物可以预防一些帕金森最严重的症状- ScienceAlert | Cough Medicine May Protect Against Some of Parkinson's Worst Symptoms - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxObENJalNnXzlaZnRWaWcwdl9mVFEyNHdWSnRpVHlWMHBBVk5JM21kaVJvemJjTXRWNEZUUnY4MzcxUWZfcUdXeUF1WUx4WXR4ZE1yWEhybUk0WFBScllTMWRJSVdfcC01UGtBc3dyOXZEVU1hUXA2QlpON3UzSnVwTVJKWVV3dEt2MU5pUjduQ2pWM2YxSXM0TlUxYnFKQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An active ingredient in cough medicines since 1979 has shown promise as a treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="166748" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease-related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroxol"&gt;ambroxol&lt;/a&gt;, isn't approved for use in the US, Canada, or Australia, but it is commonly found in cough syrups and tablets from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a gold-standard phase 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="166748" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, 22 participants with Parkinson's dementia who received a high daily dose of ambroxol for a year showed no worsening of key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.44.12.2308"&gt;neuropsychiatric symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 25 patients who received the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="166748" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; displayed worsening symptoms, gaining an average of 3.73 points on an &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/assessment/tools/neuropsychiatric-inventory"&gt;established neuropsychiatric score&lt;/a&gt;. Patients on ambroxol dropped an average of 2.45 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Parkinson's Disease Might Not Start in The Brain, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups shared similar cognitive scores related to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-170991"&gt;memory and language&lt;/a&gt;. But those taking ambroxol showed stabilization in symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, irritability, apathy, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12020130"&gt;aberrant motor activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants on ambroxol also experienced fewer falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though ambroxol was found to be safe, no clinically meaningful improvements in cognition were recorded. Yet there are reasons to remain optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal was to change the course of Parkinson's dementia," &lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/2025/06/cough-syrup-parkinsons-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Stephen Pasternak from Western University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166759" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-642x641.png" alt="Parkinson's Neuropsychiatric Symptoms" class="size-medium wp-image-166759" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-642x641.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-416x415.png 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-600x599.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30.png 727w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166759" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Sci. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the team's analysis, some participants carrying a high-risk &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; gene for Parkinson's showed improved cognitive performance on ambroxol. With a small sample size and no control group to compare outcomes to, the authors caution these results need to be followed up before drawing any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, high-risk &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GBA1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; gene&lt;/a&gt; variants tend to result in lower activity of the enzyme &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocerebrosidase"&gt;Glucocerebrosidase&lt;/a&gt; (GCase), and this, in turn, is linked to more protein clumps in the brain, like Lewy bodies, which are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;associated with Parkinson's dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2021.02.003"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that ambroxol can significantly increase GCase activity. In the current trial, those taking the drug showed 1.5 times the amount of GCase activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No serious adverse effects were reported by those taking ambroxol, although mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues were common and caused a few participants to drop out of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that some of the more serious symptoms of Parkinson's disease may be managed by ambroxol if taken regularly at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because ambroxol can easily &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hsr.2023.100096"&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists suspect the cough medicine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-used-in-cough-syrup-for-decades-offers-new-hope-as-parkinson-s-treatment"&gt;can treat neurodegenerative conditions&lt;/a&gt;, like Parkinson's, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Gaucher disease, neuroinflammation, or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that hypothesis proves to be true requires more clinical research. But the recent phase 2 trial on Parkinson's dementia gives scientists good reason to keep digging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk," &lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/2025/06/cough-syrup-parkinsons-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pasternak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you know you have high blood pressure, you’re already a step ahead. Although high blood pressure (hypertension) affects nearly half of American adults, it doesn’t cause symptoms at first—so many people don't even know they have it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to learn more about what high blood pressure means, the biggest thing to avoid doing if you have it and proven strategies you can take to improve it.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-high-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is High Blood Pressure? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your blood pressure is the force of blood pushing through your arteries. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The top number, systolic blood pressure, measures pressure when the heart beats. The bottom number, diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure can lead to several health complications, such as stroke, heart attack, kidney disease, vision loss and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, lifestyle modification is key. Assess your diet, weight and exercise habits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinaiconciergecare.org/maria-fraga-rd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maria Elena Fraga, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Diabetes Alliance at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-1-thing-to-avoid"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The #1 Thing to Avoid &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The No. 1 thing to avoid if you have high blood pressure is underestimating the impact your nutrition habits can have on your levels. Knowing that you can make a big difference in your blood pressure by changing some aspects of your diet is positive and empowering news.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Actionable habits for lowering blood pressure include limiting sodium, eating fruits and vegetables that are rich in potassium, cooking more at home and following blood-pressure-lowering eating plans. “Getting a handle on your blood pressure requires behavior and lifestyle changes, which can take time, effort, consistency and patience,” says &lt;a href="https://physeq.com/personal-trainers-trainer-nyc/sarah-currie-personal-trainer-new-york-ny/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Currie, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a personal trainer and co-owner of Physical Equilibrium in New York City. With that said, here are the impactful changes you can start making to your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cut Back on Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, eating a high-sodium diet can narrow blood vessels and increase blood pressure. “You’d be surprised how many food items contain hidden sources of sodium,” says Fraga. Packaged foods are often packed with sodium, and some of the top culprits are canned soups, frozen meals and deli meat, adds Currie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association suggests that cutting out 1,000 milligrams per day of sodium can have a beneficial impact on blood pressure. For people with high blood pressure, the AHA recommends consuming no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reduce your sodium intake, try replacing a portion of salt in your recipes with garlic, fresh herbs and spices. Read package labels and restaurant menus before buying or ordering to help make lower-sodium choices. When you’re reading labels, look at the Daily Value percentage for sodium and aim for lower-sodium foods when possible. Foods with a sodium DV of 5% or less per serving are considered a low-sodium foods, while those with 20% DV or more of sodium per serving are considered high-sodium and should be limited.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat Potassium-Rich Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium counteracts sodium by helping your body excrete it through your urine. (In short, you pee it out.) The mineral also helps relax blood vessel walls, which lowers blood pressure. The AHA recommends consuming 3,500 to 5,000 milligrams of potassium daily to prevent or treat&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/high-blood-pressure-overview-7505223" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Boost your potassium intake by eating more fruits and vegetables. Aim to eat 4½ cups of fruits and vegetables every day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods rich in potassium include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prunes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bananas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney beans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orange juice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cantaloupe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apricots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soybeans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raisins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spinach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-fat dairy products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cook More Meals at Home &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Restaurant meals are often high in sodium, which can make it difficult to stay within the recommended limits. One study found that the average sodium content in a fast-food meal was about 1,300 milligrams—nearly all of the recommended sodium limit for someone with high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cooking at home gives you control over all the ingredients. Whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, dried legumes, unsalted nuts and seeds and fresh sources of protein contain little to no sodium. When cooking you can flavor foods with fresh and dried herbs and spices, including basil, oregano, cumin, rosemary, turmeric and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This doesn’t mean you can’t eat out—it just takes a little planning. If the restaurant provides nutrition information, check it ahead of time to plan out a meal that’s lower in sodium. Avoid or limit fried foods, which tend to be higher in sodium, says Currie, and ask for sauces and dressings on the side. Opt for baked, broiled, grilled or steamed proteins paired with green and other colorful vegetables. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Consider the DASH or Mediterranean Style of Eating   &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was created to intentionally treat high blood pressure. This eating style focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy, lean protein and limited saturated fats, red meat, added sugar and sodium. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/11624/dash-diet-meal-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; is rich in important nutrients that help lower blood pressure, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber and protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8046714/a-new-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to the DASH eating plan, as it’s full of fresh fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich beans and whole grains, nuts and seeds. This eating plan also recommends limiting foods that contain higher amounts of saturated fat, such as red meat. One food that’s famously associated with the Mediterranean diet is extra-virgin olive oil, which is rich in polyphenols that can protect the heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Improving the quality of your diet is one effective way to manage hypertension. Other lifestyle factors that help bring down blood pressure include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If lifestyle factors are not enough to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range, you may need medication. Reach out to a health care provider for guidance.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure is a common condition affecting many Americans, yet, you can take steps to improve your numbers and prevent hypertension. One of the biggest mistakes people make is not realizing how important nutrition is for managing blood pressure and maintaining a healthy heart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small, consistent steps—like reading labels to cut down on sodium, cooking at home more often and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables—can make a big difference. For personalized support and guidance, ask a health care provider about working with a registered dietitian who can create an individualized eating plan and set goals that work for you.

A new randomized, placebo-controlled trial published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-024-01278-7" target="_blank"&gt;Research on Child and Adolescent Psychopathology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that a 12-week course of two probiotic strains was linked to lower hyperactivity-impulsivity ratings in children aged five to nine and to modest gains in comfort-related quality-of-life scores among children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder describes a set of lifelong developmental differences marked by persistent social-communication difficulties and a preference for repetitive or highly focused behaviours. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in contrast, is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention, motor restlessness, and impulsive actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both conditions emerge early in life, show high rates of overlap, and often involve delays in executive functions that help a child plan, inhibit urges, and regulate emotions. Over recent years, researchers have turned their attention to the community of microbes that lives inside the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some intestinal bacteria can manufacture or modulate neurotransmitters such as dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, chemicals that also shape reward, movement, and self-control within the brain. If the mix of microbes differs in children with neurodevelopmental conditions, supplying strains that boost those messenger molecules could conceivably ease everyday symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine this possibility, a team of researchers in Spain conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 80 children aged 5 to 16 years. The study included 38 children diagnosed with ADHD and 42 children diagnosed with autism, some of whom had both diagnoses. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a daily probiotic supplement or a placebo for 12 weeks. The probiotic mixture contained two strains of bacteria—&lt;em&gt;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Levilactobacillus brevis&lt;/em&gt;—which are known to promote the synthesis of dopamine and GABA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the first dose and again after twelve weeks, parents completed standard rating scales that capture inattentive behaviours, hyperactivity-impulsivity, peer relations, and other challenges. For children with autism, parents also filled out the Social Responsiveness Scale, which gauges social awareness, communication, and repetitive patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each child took a computerized continuous-performance task that records omission errors (a sign of inattention) and commission errors (a sign of impulsivity). Parents answered questionnaires about executive function in everyday life, recorded their child’s sleep patterns, and judged five domains of health-related quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses included every child who started the trial, whether or not the family missed a few doses, reflecting real-world use. Across the whole sample, average scores on parent checklists and performance tasks shifted only slightly and did so to a similar degree in the probiotic and placebo groups. When the team separated the data by age, a clearer pattern emerged. Among children aged five to nine, parent ratings of hyperactivity-impulsivity fell more sharply in the probiotic condition than in the placebo condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference equaled a very large effect size in the autism group and a moderate-to-large effect size in the attention-deficit group. Within-group comparisons told a similar story: young recipients of the probiotic moved from the “elevated” into the “high-average” range on that subscale, while their peers on placebo showed no reliable change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance on the continuous-performance task largely mirrored those parent reports. Children with autism who swallowed the probiotic made fewer commission errors—an index of hurried responses—by the end of the study, whereas the placebo group showed a smaller drop. Detectability scores, which reflect how well a child can distinguish target from non-target stimuli, nudged upward only in the placebo arm. Reaction-time variability, a hallmark of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, was unchanged in both arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked beyond core symptoms, they found one additional glimmer of benefit. On the Child Health and Illness Profile, a broad inventory of perceived well-being, children with autism in the probiotic arm reported a higher sense of physical comfort—covering aches, energy, and stomach complaints—than they had at baseline, and the effect size again reached the large range. Sleep ratings, executive-function scores, and social-communication scales stayed level for most participants, regardless of the supplement they received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might a bacterial drink calm hyperactivity in younger children yet leave inattention untouched? One possibility is that the strains used in the trial release gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that tempers motor activity. Earlier work shows lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in parts of the brain that coordinate movement and impulse control in both neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a probiotic raises the supply of that transmitter—either directly or by stimulating host cells to produce more—it could dampen fidgety behaviour without necessarily sharpening focus. Alternatively, the microbes could influence dopamine signalling, which plays out differently in circuits that support controlled attention versus those that regulate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modest scope of the changes tempers enthusiasm. The trial lasted only three months, a brief window in the long developmental arc of these conditions. The participating families were, on average, socially advantaged and reported few severe behaviour challenges, limiting room for improvement. The sample size—just over eighty—was sufficient to detect large effects but not the nuanced gains that might unfold in smaller subgroups, such as children with pronounced gastrointestinal complaints or those who do not respond well to medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the investigators did not profile each child’s gut microbiome before and after treatment, so it remains unclear whether the probiotic actually took hold and shifted microbial balance in a way that mattered to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could address those gaps by enrolling larger cohorts across multiple clinics, extending the intervention to six months or a year, and adding stool sequencing to confirm bacterial colonisation and neurotransmitter output. Researchers might also explore whether combining probiotics with traditional behavioural therapies or with dietary fibre that feeds beneficial microbes produces a stronger signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials that begin during infancy, before hyperactivity or social-communication problems are fully established, may reveal whether microbial support can alter developmental trajectories rather than merely quiet symptoms that have already appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current findings are preliminary, they add weight to the idea that the gut-brain connection offers a promising, low-risk target for supporting children with neurodevelopmental differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-024-01278-7" target="_blank"&gt;Effect of Probiotics on the Symptomatology of Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents: Pilot Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Meritxell Rojo-Marticella, Victoria Arija, and Josefa Canals-Sans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 22:04:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPVUhtZWt6Rk1famIta3pGaDBsWWhnb2pNNHJ3aWE1cm1nTXNHUnN2Y3VMdWhiV2NRRERHanBNOTVDQVRZdGF4b2t3UFRubFNIRG1MNHlveUVNZWpTLWJSMldHVEVVLTFXamE0dU5IX0J6c2ZqSy02a0tycTdWSFp5V0tneUZvWUR1N2lZTHI5MlNidl9nSXpZTlFyUmxaaHJ2a0RwYnJUa0FpUE5WTUo1dGZKcVM</guid></item><item><title>费耶特县新报告的4例麻疹病例- WKYT | 4 new measles cases reported in Fayette County - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPN3NOMThnbWJCd3l2SThIMnYzVktPWmhZQkEtbDJibWhmTjRwTk5KMktUM2xtODhMS1RyWUhXX0xJZk5PQklNRWN5ZDhvem1kamUwRmFqWEc5N2VBYjdHQktHclN6VzVoa19xMjhFZ1BlanZvZ1BFWTlpQUlkQmQ1c2J3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LEXINGTON, Ky.

This system is crucial to movement, motivation and decision-making, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the study was to determine whether a specific molecule — the MLi-2 LRRK2 kinase inhibitor — could reverse the effect of overactive enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

the scientists tried feeding them the inhibitor for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were initially no changes detected in brain structure, signaling or function of the dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;When there is too much LRRK2 activity, it changes the structure of the brain cells, disrupting important communication between neurons and cells.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after three months of eating the inhibitor, mice affected by the overactive enzyme appeared to have restored their neurons to the point where they were virtually the same as those without the genetic mutation, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Findings from this study suggest that inhibiting the LRRK2 enzyme could stabilize the progression of symptoms if patients can be identified early enough," Pfeffer said in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was in mice, not people, but our current results indicate that similar

affects nearly one million Americans, according to the Parkinson's Foundation, which has offices in New York and Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that early intervention is key, as Parkinson’s symptoms often appear years after the disease begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying and treating at-risk individuals sooner could potentially halt or reverse neuron loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that it might be possible to improve, not just stabilize, the condition of patients with Parkinson’s disease," Pfeffer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

This research is complicated by the onslaught of pathogens that came to the Americas during that era and the difficulty of determining a diagnosis from ancient DNA, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ancient-dna-and-modern-genomes-can-reveal-stories-of-past-peoples-from-the-iron-age-to-chernobyl-geneticist-says" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ancient-dna-and-modern-genomes-can-reveal-stories-of-past-peoples-from-the-iron-age-to-chernobyl-geneticist-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ancient DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has become a great tool that allows us to dig deeper into diseases that have had a long history in the Americas," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kirstenbos.ca/" target="_blank" data-url="https://kirstenbos.ca/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kirsten Bos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular paleopathologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and co-author of the study, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="we-were-initially-suspicious-3"&gt;"We were initially suspicious"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;genome from the Chilean bones had "amazing preservation, which is uncommon in ancient DNA, especially from specimens of that age," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lesleysitter.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.lesleysitter.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lesley Sitter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and co-author of the study, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After isolating the DNA of the pathogen, "we were initially suspicious, since leprosy is regarded as a colonial-era disease," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OXEgPlcAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OXEgPlcAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Darío Ramirez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral candidate of biological anthropology at the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, said in the statement. With further scrutiny, the team confirmed that they were indeed looking at evidence of leprosy caused by a type of bacteria that's considered rare in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is significant, but not conclusive enough to determine if the disease originated in the Americas, Bos said. "So far the evidence points in the direction of an American origin, but we'll need more genomes from other time periods and contexts to be sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work also helps to answer another major question: how did leprosy spread across such vast regions of the Americas? One idea is that the pathogen arose during an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/the-1st-americans-were-not-who-we-thought-they-were" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/the-1st-americans-were-not-who-we-thought-they-were"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early peopling event in the Americas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or, perhaps the pathogen was already in the Americas in an animal reservoir, and then it was contracted by people, the researchers wrote in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still don't fully understand how the leprosy-causing bacteria spread, but their presence in such far corners of the world suggests there are environmental or animal factors responsible for transmission, Avanzi explained. "Identifying the origin and possible non-human reservoirs of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; is crucial for improving prevention and control strategies, both for human health and wildlife conservation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study complements &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7144" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7144" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Avanzi and her team, which analyzed more recent remains from Canada and Argentina and also discovered evidence that &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; was dispersed across the Americas before European colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cognitive lapses aren’t always linked to aging or dementia. Factors like stress, anxiety, and multitasking can mimic or contribute. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating brain-healthy foods, staying physically active and engaging in mentally stimulating activities are ways to slow cognitive decline. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial for proper diagnosis and intervention. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It happens from time to time: You start telling a story, only to lose your train of thought halfway through. Or you walk into a room and can't remember what you went in there to do. Mental glitches like these happen to everyone and are understandably scary, but aren't necessarily a sign of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009483/americans-adults-dementia-study-ways-to-reduce-your-risk/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. "The feeling of your brain short-circuiting is often more likely due to psychological processes," says &lt;a href="https://www.stetson.edu/software/greenpages/index.php?q=Department%20of%20Psychology&amp;amp;c=d" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sarah Garcia-Beaumier, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; Increases in stress, distractions, multitasking, anxiety or depression can be contributors. "A common consideration we have to make clinically is whether cognitive symptoms are due to early dementia, or rather due to a depressive or anxiety disorder," Garcia-Beaumier says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-cognitive-lapses-vs-cognitive-decline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Cognitive Lapses vs. Cognitive Decline  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive decline typically involves a worsening of performance in areas such as memory, attention or language.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Common signs include forgetting to call someone or struggling to recall the right word. When those symptoms appear much more than they did previously, so much so that others are starting to notice, "that's typically an early red flag for cognitive decline beyond what we expect for the normal aging process," says Garcia-Beaumier. Normal aging may cause minor delays in memory retrieval, like struggling to remember a name but recalling it later. These are not signs of dementia or cognitive impairment, per Thomas Hammond, M.D. "Forgetting conversations or important appointments, or feeling lost in familiar places, are more worrisome and concerning for significant early cognitive impairment,” Hammond explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Garcia-Beaumier notes that some individuals with mild cognitive impairment may stabilize or improve over time. Still, unresolved psychological distress or untreated health issues could increase the risk of dementia, making it crucial to address potential warning signs early.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-common-signs-of-cognitive-decline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Common Signs of Cognitive Decline  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. You struggle to stay on top of things.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The corticolimbic system of the brain modulates the experience of anxiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "It also happens to be the same area of the brain that helps with processing speed, attention, planning, judgment, organization and lots of thinking skills," says Garcia-Beaumier. "So if there's a change in this area of the brain due to stress or anxiety, these cognitive skills are also affected."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This overlap in brain pathways, along with the larger amount of resources devoted to modulating your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety due to your body constantly shifting between survival and recuperation mode, will lead to a varying array of cognitive deficits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pathways are also crucial in processing information—if you can no longer pay attention to things, your brain isn't going to be able to encode them and retain them for later memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. You can't find the words you're looking for.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive decline manifests itself in almost all aspects of complex daily tasks, especially our language. "Even a simple undertaking, like naming a kitchen appliance, engages our brain networks extensively, making it a sensitive indicator of early decline," says &lt;a href="https://movmntmethod.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Aubry Alvarez-Bakker, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A strong sign can be found in moments when you might forget a simple, specific word you're looking for, so you try to describe it instead. Over time, you might also start having difficulty keeping up with conversations, which can lead to anxiety in social situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The specific mechanism behind why this happens isn't fully known, but research shows that language decline often originates in the left side of the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "We also know that low BDNF production (a protein produced by our nervous system that's crucial for the production of new brain cells) means fewer new cells to help us carry on activity across our brain," says Alvarez-Bakker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, production of this protein naturally declines, so our body relies heavily on our environment to create BDNF to "fertilize" our brain and allow new cells to form. "Among the best foods to consume to boost BDNF in our body—and subsequently ward off cognitive decline—are blueberries, turmeric, green tea and dark chocolate," says Alvarez-Bakker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. You feel blasé about things you used to enjoy.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because apathy is a common symptom of severe burnout, it's easy to pay no mind that it can also be a symptom of cognitive decline. "It's actually the most common symptom and perhaps the most overlooked," says Alvarez-Bakker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A sudden loss of interest in activities you used to love, or a willingness to throw in the towel easily, is a common symptom of dementia. You might lose interest in reading books, gardening or many other activities you used to enjoy. You might also find things that used to be easy for you to accomplish are now overwhelming, or that you avoid complex tasks or projects entirely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This is unfortunate because withdrawing from stimulation is known to speed up the decline process," says Alvarez-Bakker. "Luckily, our lifestyle can help counteract this symptom to an extent." When apathy creeps in, the best step to take is to get personal by integrating things you deeply enjoy—music, art, sports, reminiscing—into daily activities that will boost your participation in life, and in turn, stimulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. You've been acting out of character.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Subtle personality changes are an often-missed sign of cognitive decline, primarily because of how easily they can be blamed on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/early-adulthood-inflammation-may-influence-cognition-in-midlife-8676000" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; (say, becoming easily angered or swearing when that isn't a regular part of your vocabulary).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might also find yourself withdrawing from social interactions and activities—and when you are around others, you may not participate in discussions, but instead stay quiet. "These are symptoms which are often written off as an individual being shy," says Hammond. "However, the person who was once talkative and garrulous will often become quiet and a wallflower as an early sign of developing cognitive decline."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless if stress is the cause or a variable that's augmenting the cognitive decline, "any treatment hoping to prevent or reduce cognitive decline needs to incorporate stress management," says, &lt;a href="https://www.dncneurology.com/isaac-tourgeman" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Isaac Tourgeman, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 5. You're always ruminating and worrying.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incessantly ruminating and worrying keeps your fight-or-flight response in overdrive, and symptoms of chronic stress can mimic cognitive decline, such as forgetfulness and inattention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Uncontrolled, toxic thinking has the potential to create a state of low-grade inflammation across the brain and body over time, which can impact our cognitive health and ability to remember or recall information," says &lt;a href="https://drleaf.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Caroline Leaf, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "If left unmanaged, this kind of chronic cognitive upset can progress into varying levels of cognitive decline."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Resolution of the underlying causes of your rumination and worry is paramount to improving current and preventing future symptoms of cognitive decline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 6. You've recently been sick or have a chronic condition.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Cognitive dulling is a common feature associated with general medical illnesses, such as the flu, urinary tract infection and gastroenteritis," says Hammond. "Metabolic stress caused by minor infection will often lead to a transient cognitive decline," Hammond added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other conditions can also lead to cognitive decline, including sleep disorders (such as sleep apnea).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Similar to psychological distress, sometimes symptoms can be resolved if it's due to one of these conditions," says Garcia-Beaumier. "But if left untreated, it does increase a person's risk of dementia down the line."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depression can result in what's called pseudodementia, where depression essentially masquerades as cognitive impairment.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Symptoms present as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention and lowered energy and motivation," says Tourgeman. This is when it's especially important to consult with your doctor to ensure the right diagnosis is made and proper treatment given.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 7. Other people are noticing your mental glitches.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We all experience cognitive glitches to a certain extent when going through the pressures of life, but a good rule of thumb is if anyone who knows you has noticed a consistent increase of these symptoms over time, it may be a sign that you're experiencing cognitive decline," says Leaf. Usually the person experiencing symptoms is the last to be aware of the decline, so it's important to be open to feedback and proactive about taking action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "While we currently aren't able to change our genes, we can influence how our environment impacts them," says Tourgeman. "A healthy lifestyle—eating a brain-healthy diet (like the MIND Diet), exercising regularly, reducing stress and distractions, maintaining a sense of utility and connectedness—can all go a long way."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And no healthy lifestyle with the goal of avoiding or improving cognitive decline would be complete without a wide range of activities that keep your brain engaged.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Playing brain games on your phone will only go so far, though, mostly because you'll only get really good at that one thing," says Garcia-Beaumier. "Doing lots of activities that you enjoy and that challenge you is best." Things like reading, playing games, learning new skills and dancing can all contribute to optimal cognitive health when done in conjunction with other healthy habits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Any time someone notices cognitive changes, such as memory not being as good or the brain feeling slower or foggy, they should check in with their doctor," says Garcia-Beaumier. "But it's especially important if family or friends are also noticing issues or if the issues make it hard to fulfill daily responsibilities."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can try to work on decreasing stress and improving how you take care of any other health conditions to see if that also clears up any cognitive issues, but there isn't a definitive way to know whether your symptoms are due to stress, psychological issues, another health condition or cognitive decline without talking to a healthcare provider and possibly seeing specialists for further testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Even getting some basic tests, early before any issues arise, can allow your doctor to compare your current cognitive performance to possible cognitive issues in the future," says Garcia-Beaumier.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The occasional mental lapse, like misplacing your keys or forgetting the name of a person you just met, is a normal part of life and not necessarily a cause for concern. These fleeting moments of forgetfulness are often tied to stress, lack of sleep, or even simply being preoccupied with too many things at once. However, when these cognitive issues become consistent, noticeable to others and begin to interfere with daily life, they may signal something more significant, such as cognitive decline. Taking proactive steps to manage stress, maintain overall health, and engage in stimulating mental and physical activities can help you protect your brain's function and resilience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Understanding the difference between normal cognitive aging and more concerning symptoms is key to addressing issues early on. Consult a healthcare professional if you or those close to you observe persistent changes in memory, attention, or overall behavior. Seeking support and adopting lifestyle habits that prioritize brain health can not only slow potential decline but also improve your quality of life. By staying informed and proactive, you give yourself the best chance at maintaining your cognitive health and vitality for years to come.&lt;br&gt;

His wife immediately called 911 and the 61-year-old was rushed to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montalvo said: 'Everything started spinning. I went to stand up, and I fell. I just didn't understand what was going on. I couldn't understand it. I didn't know why I was feeling that way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing he knew, the retired New York cop &lt;span&gt;woke up to the sound of concerned whispers from family and doctors, murmuring about a '15 percent percent chance of survival.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It turns out, Montalvo was having an ischemic stroke, which occurs when a clot restricts blood flow to the brain and deprives it of oxygen. This can lead to death or life-long disabilities, as stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of an ischemic stroke - which account for 87 percent of all strokes - include some symptoms Montalvo was experiencing: sudden weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, vision problems, severe headache, dizziness and loss of coordination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds - about 795,000 people a year - and every three minutes, a person dies from a stroke, the CDC reports. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montalvo added: 'I was like "Oh my God, I'm going to die. I don't even have a chance to say goodbye to anybody."' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nestor Montalvo (third from the right) suffered a stroke in September 2024 at 61 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Montalvo was having a stroke, he thought: 'Oh my God, I'm going to die. I don't even have a chance to say goodbye to anybody'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a stroke occurs, 'time is brain,' Dr Taylor Kimberley, chief of neurocritical care at Massachusetts General Hospital, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/headache-stroke-recovery-rehabilitation-catholic-mercy-health/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;CBS. She was not involved in Montalvo's case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means the faster a person can receive treatment can make all the difference in avoiding brain damage. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the worse the damage can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Montalvo arrived at Catholic Health's Mercy Hospital in Nassau, Long Island, in September 2024, his symptoms immediately triggered a stroke protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once blood flow during a stroke is stopped, cells immediately start to die in major tissues, such as the cerebellum and brain stem, both of which regulate coordination and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Premier Neurology, anywhere from seven to 65 percent of people having a stroke will experience some form of a headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In less than 10 minutes after arrival, Montalvo was assessed as a potential stroke patient, and five minutes later was hurried into a CT scan to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then administered a clot-busting medication called TNK, and Montalvo underwent a minor procedure to ensure the clot had been broken up and would not reoccur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the initial procedure, Montalvo remained critical as his vocal chords stopped working and he underwent a tracheostomy - a surgery in which an opening is made in the throat and a tube is inserted to help with breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He couldn't talk or swallow for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Montalvo underwent rigorous speech therapy to strengthen his throat in order to be able to speak again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the following six weeks, Montalvo underwent an hour of speech therapy a day and did exercises to strengthen muscles in the mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When his tracheostomy tube was finally removed, he underwent three more procedures to repair his throat and was eventually able to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, nearly a year later, life for Montalvo is returning somewhat back to normal, although he continues to use a cane to walk and have outpatient treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He hopes to further his progress, however, telling CBS that recovering was harder than getting through the stroke itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'You take life for granted, and then when something like this happens, it wakes you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You hear people talk about it, and it just sounds like it's not going to happen to you. All of a sudden, it happens to you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Fordham Tick Index, which monitors tick activity in southern New York, Connecticut and Northern New Jersey, currently rates the bite risk as "very high" – 9 out of 10 on its scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC reports that climate change may be contributing to the increasing numbers. In regions where Lyme disease is already present, milder winters result in fewer disease-carrying ticks dying during cold months, the agency notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to CDC data, May typically marks the annual peak for tick-bite emergencies. These rising numbers have prompted health officials to remind the public about the dangers posed by these tiny insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC warns that ticks can transmit various diseases through their bites, many of which share similar symptoms. Most people who visit emergency rooms report fever and chills, headaches, fatigue and muscle aches. Some patients also develop distinctive rashes, particularly those associated with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With outdoor activities in full swing this summer, the CDC has issued several recommendations to prevent illness. The agency advises avoiding wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, and staying in the center of trails when hiking. It also recommends using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, or other approved ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC recommends treating outdoor clothing and gear with permethrin, which remains effective even after multiple washes. Those planning to use both sunscreen and insect repellent should apply sunscreen first, followed by the repellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials are also emphasizing that no area is immune to tick activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 19:18:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOTVMyQWpPOE1SdE1Md1BVSEZ3aDJFX2ZrUWJhQVM0cnZPZmNkRnRHd2lsRGtaM0kwTVJqMlNlbWk1VXNTeGlZOW9PSUVJSU5rSDhGaDNuWjU3dWtMVXBqN2M1UkdaaVhCSzhvdHVvNGNUSndodWhZX3FhS0pzSXlxcHZ4VmVySExPRWthQllkdzltbzJOTzhMRNIBngFBVV95cUxQN2paMjhTVk5SMG04MDBKa1RlYXVRTzBvT0p5REdrYzR2TFZKOHI3ZU1GM2U4bGMwb21Ya05IUWpxWUgyOHZnS2RQTVRpYTY4ZTJuNHdSWmljNk9ZcXpYRnFiN0VsUExmQjJJZTFOVFlWT2h0Y0Q5M0ZtQXZjTk1LMlBrbGlwMThnRU1MYllfaVo4MGxILXVFYnJVNDN2dw</guid></item><item><title>随着RFK Jr.追求反疫苗议程，麻疹病例达到33年来的最高水平- Ars Technica | Measles cases reach 33-year high as RFK Jr. pursues anti-vaccine agenda - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOTG5iLXVITHBsU3dvLVdrSktKZURBM2Y2RGNMM2ZhNmFpa2swRTY3NDItRG1KMlVfekQtSkxpTG53OHpxUUdZbUg4dVd2SW1xdG9yLTc5SjFkcjZBYzQ2NGk4eV9EdkpFY0xlV0pLcEZUckluaVpXV1k1SGRwNTdsc25KZ2pqazhicTdXU0tSS2lVYlBqVlRjQkstV2FBZlZKUHBYcXk2WTVSNlU3SzB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Such is the case in Gaines County, Texas, where the largest outbreak this year has erupted. So far, that outbreak, which spans four states, accounts for at least 950 of the country's 1,281 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, there have been a whopping 27 outbreaks in the country just in the first six months. According to national &lt;a href="https://campushealth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/YSPH%20VMOC%20Special%20Report%20-%20Measles%20Outbreak%20%20Southwest%20US%207-6-2025.pdf"&gt;data compiled by researchers at Yale School of Public Health, as of July 6&lt;/a&gt;, the 1,281 cases are across 39 states, with around 90 percent of the cases associated with one of the outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reports a national measles case count but only updates its numbers on Wednesdays. According to the CDC's latest data, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;155 people have been hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; for the infection, and three people have died—two otherwise healthy young children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico. All three deaths were in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, most of the cases in the country are in unvaccinated children and teens. About 28 percent of cases are under the age of 5 and about 37 percent are ages 5 to 19. Of all the cases, 92 percent were in people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have believed that inflammation inevitably increases with age, quietly fuelling diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24833586/"&gt;heart disease, dementia and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00888-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of Indigenous populations challenges that idea and could reshape how we think about ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have identified chronic low-level inflammation – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10911963/"&gt;"inflammaging"&lt;/a&gt; – as one of the primary drivers of age-related diseases. Think of it as your body's immune system stuck in overdrive – constantly fighting battles that don't exist, gradually wearing down organs and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But inflammaging might not be a universal feature of ageing after all. Instead, it could be a byproduct of how we live in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, compared patterns of inflammation in four very different communities around the world. Two groups were from modern, industrialised societies – older adults living in Italy and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two were Indigenous communities who live more traditional lifestyles: the Tsimane people of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli in the forests of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from more than 2,800 people, looking at a wide range of inflammatory molecules, known as cytokines. Their goal was to find out whether a pattern seen in earlier studies – where certain signs of inflammation rise with age and are linked to disease – also appears in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, it turns out, is both yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Italian and Singaporean participants, the researchers found a fairly &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-99375-1"&gt;consistent inflammaging pattern&lt;/a&gt;. As people aged, levels of inflammatory markers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor, rose together. Higher levels were linked to a greater risk of chronic diseases including kidney disease and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the Tsimane and Orang Asli populations, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33100820/"&gt;inflammaging pattern was absent&lt;/a&gt;. The same inflammatory molecules did not rise consistently with age, and they were not strongly linked to age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, among the Tsimane, who face high rates of infections from parasites and other pathogens, inflammation levels were often elevated. Yet this &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/abstract"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt; lead to the same rates of chronic diseases that are common in industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite high inflammatory markers, the Tsimane experience very low rates of conditions such as heart disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166946" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammaging may not be universal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results raise important questions. One possibility is that inflammaging, at least as measured through these blood signals, is not a universal biological feature of ageing. Instead, it may arise in societies marked by high-calorie diets, low physical activity and reduced exposure to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166953" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166953" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642.jpg" alt="burgers and chips" class="wp-image-166953 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166953" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;High calorie, western-style diets could be responsible for aging-related inflammation. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFEZbXxU4/"&gt;ksenee/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, chronic inflammation linked to ageing and disease might not simply result from an inevitable biological process, but rather from a mismatch between our ancient physiology and the modern environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that in communities with more traditional lifestyles – where people are more active, eat differently and are exposed to more infections – the immune system may work in a different way. In these groups, higher levels of inflammation might be a normal, healthy response to their environment, rather than a sign that the body is breaking down with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that inflammaging may still occur in all humans, but it might appear in different ways that are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35246947/"&gt;not captured by measuring inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; in the blood. It could be happening at a cellular or tissue level, where it remains invisible to the blood tests used in this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed, they could have significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they challenge how we diagnose and treat chronic inflammation in ageing. Biomarkers used to define inflammaging in European or Asian populations might not apply in other settings, or even among all groups within industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166956" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642.jpg" alt="elderly thai man" class="wp-image-166956 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166956" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Biomarkers the define aging in some populations might not apply to others. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFEPL3pTdA/"&gt;Sorapong's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they suggest that lifestyle interventions aimed at lowering chronic inflammation, such as exercise, changes in diet, or drugs targeting specific inflammatory molecules, might have different effects in different populations. What works for people living in cities might be unnecessary, or even ineffective, in those living traditional lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, this research serves as an important reminder that much of our knowledge about human health and ageing comes from studies conducted in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429567/"&gt;wealthy, industrialised nations&lt;/a&gt;. Findings from these groups cannot automatically be assumed to apply worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are clear: this study is just the beginning. They urge scientists to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00082-y"&gt;dig deeper&lt;/a&gt;, using new tools that can detect inflammation not just in the blood, but within tissues and cells where the real story of ageing may be unfolding. Just as important, they call for more inclusive research that spans the full range of human experience, not just the wealthy, urbanised corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this study offers an important lesson. What we thought was a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317232120"&gt;universal truth about the biology of ageing&lt;/a&gt; might instead be a local story, shaped by our environment, lifestyle and the way we live.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260322/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

At least three people have died from the illness, and 155 others were in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A vast majority of the measles cases - 92% - were in people who were either unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the Centres for Disease Control (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The worst hit state is Texas, CDC data shows, where more than 700 cases have been reported. Other states with dozens of cases include Kansas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials say that measles spread is occurring mostly in neighbourhoods where vaccination rates are lower, such as Mennonite communities in Texas that opt out of modern medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The outbreak comes as anti-vaccine sentiment in the US and elsewhere has grown in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccinations and had minimised the outbreak. He later endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine as illness spread, saying in a post on X that it is "the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles cases in the US were at their highest in recent memory in 1990, with nearly 28,000 reported infections, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The illness was later declared eliminated around the year 2000, when cases sharply declined to less than 90 thanks to high vaccination rates and rapid outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases started ticking up slightly in 2014 and again in 2019, when 1,274 confirmed infections were reported. But cases in 2025 have just surpassed that figure, with 1,277 infections now reported across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Public health experts have said that the US will lose measles elimination status if there is continued spread of measles at the current rate for more than 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result of the current outbreak, more people are now getting the measles vaccine in the US. Between 1 January and 16 March, Texas gave at least 173, 000 measles doses compared to 158,000 in the same time period last year, state health department data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Large measles outbreaks have been reported recently in other countries, including the UK. Last year marked the highest number of confirmed measles cases reported in England since 2012 at nearly 3,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since January of this year, there had been 529 cases reported in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada is also experiencing a measles outbreak, with more than 3,000 cases reported in 2025 so far. The bulk of the cases are in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:54:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5jRU80MzNTbkd4R0xDd2EtX04tcHVnZE9XUjNjc0QxZGgtazFabGRha3l4Y0M4a1FWOFNQNm9YOTY2eTdhVkVQajJTaENac0dacVAxcjFDdXZMQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBscVNsSnlWc2ZELUl1UnhNVWdPSXdfQjNzNUdadFZ6MnFkb0VydllJQ1JiTVZLYlU3QlJacXdpZkVMSEhSeVRkSXk1eXQxYlMyQlhEN2ltLTgwMVdmUHow</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家分享了新的糖替代品， “不会使胰岛素水平飙升并降低体脂肪” -印度时报 | Cardiologist shares new sugar alternative that 'doesn't spike insulin levels and reduces body fat' - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the only healthy alternatives to sugar have been known as stevia, truvia, monk fruit extract, coconut sugar, date sugar and more. All of these might be healthier for consumption than sugar but do have similar harmful effects on the body in lesser quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an expert has shared a unique alternative to sugar that not only doesn't spike blood sugar and insulin levels but also reduces fat. Dr Alok Chopra, cardiologist and functional medicine expert defined the alternative as allulose, which is 70% as sweet as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allulose is a rare sugar alternative that doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, making it a promising option for those managing diabetes or insulin resistance," shared the doctor on Instagram. Additionally, he added that 70% of allulose is absorbed in the blood and passes out in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27679104" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="benefits-of-allulose" source="keywords"&gt;benefits of allulose&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor even mentioned the benefits of consuming allulose:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: With just 0.2-0.4 calories per gram, it consists of only 1/10th of the calories of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vital for organs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: It is safe for vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and fat tissues and also reduces inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthy for blood-sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: With its low glycemic index, allulose improves insulin sensitivity and reduces post-meal glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increases energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Allulose not only boosts mitochondrial function but also improves endurance and protects the body against diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Improves metabolism and reduces fat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Allulose also helps in fat burning, reduces body fat and enhances feelings of satiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27679102" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="natural-sources-of-allulose" source="keywords"&gt;natural sources of Allulose&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Confirmed cases appear to be the “tip of a much bigger iceberg”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. However, as the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disrupted routine childhood visits&lt;/a&gt; to the doctors and anti-vaccine organizations saw their &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-group-ican-del-bigtree-rfk-jr-nearly-doubled-revenue-rcna185214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;coffers swell&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, measles vaccination rates have fallen below a critical threshold to prevent outbreaks in some communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of 4 July, &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins University’s&lt;/a&gt; Center for Outbreak Response Innovation counted 1,277 measles cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; 1,267 cases, but has not updated its data since 2 July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The number of new cases has slowed down, but I don’t think there’s any reason to suggest this will be our last,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean for the national school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He later added: “It’s a very dark epidemic that never had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest national tally will eclipse 2019, when unvaccinated members of New York City’s isolated orthodox Jewish community drove a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;large outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, and the nation ended the year with 1,274 confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Americans will need to look back to 1992 to find a higher annual measles tally. In 1992, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020688.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; confirmed 2,126 cases, with the largest outbreaks in Kentucky and Texas. Texas has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;753 cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, according to the state health department, opening up the possibility that Texas could exceed the 1992 annual total as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The enormous outbreak comes as Donald Trump’s health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, who once ran an influential anti-vaccine group, has injected upheaval into US vaccine policy and spread misinformation about treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is a viral disease characterized by a top-down rash, high fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus is one of the most infectious diseases known to medicine. There is no cure for measles. The best way to prevent measles is by getting vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), which is 97% effective with two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although most people recover, as many as one in five infected children require hospitalization; one in 20 get pneumonia and one in 1,000 can develop encephalitis, which can lead to lifelong disability, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disease can also &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20that%2C%20after,personal%20replies%20cannot%20be%20provided.)" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;weaken the host’s immune system&lt;/a&gt; and lead to more future infections. In rare cases, measles can cause an incurable &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;degenerative brain disorder&lt;/a&gt;. The US has already seen three deaths from measles this year, both in otherwise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before a measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, an estimated 3-4 million Americans were sickened each year, 48,000 were hospitalized and an estimated 400-500 died, according to the CDC. From 1994 to 2023 in the US alone, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm#T2_down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; the measles vaccine saved 85,000 lives and prevented 104m illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the vaccine has been wildly successful, it has also been the target of sustained misinformation by people who have a financial stake in reduced vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 1998, a British doctor hypothesized a link between the MMR and increasing autism rates. The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, was later found to have committed &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;, failed to report conflicts of interest and lost his license. The article was retracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://asatonline.org/research-treatment/resources/topical-articles/autism-and-vaccines-the-evidence-to-date/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Reams of science&lt;/a&gt; has since examined and re-examined the evidence, and found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Still, the debunked connection has found an afterlife as a talking point for anti-vaccine groups who have attracted a vocal minority of parents. The overwhelming majority of Americans still vaccinate children against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, alongside longtime anti-vaccine talking points about autism and “medical freedom”, Hotez said a new threat was the, “very pernicious health and wellness and influencer movement that’s got a big profit motive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Outbreaks appear to be “occurring in the same [parts] of the US that had some of the lowest Covid vaccination rates”, said Hotez, introducing the possibility that anti-vaccine sentiment is “spilling over to childhood immunizations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In June, Kennedy unilaterally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 expert members of a CDC advisory panel on vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stacked&lt;/a&gt; the committee with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; ideological allies.

&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates significant alterations in circulating immune cell populations in patients with [primary Sjögren’s], linking these changes to clinical disease activity,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team further highlighted three specific immune cell types with potential as biomarkers of the disease, and possibly as targets for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings may provide mechanistic insights into … pathogenesis [disease development] and establish a foundation for developing … targeted therapeutic strategies,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their study, “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1756-185X.70276"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Immunophenotypic Profiling Reveals Circulating Lymphocyte Dysregulation in Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An autoimmune condition, &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the immune system mistakenly targeting the body’s own cells, causing an inflammatory response. This typically occurs in tear and salivary glands, leading to dry eyes and dry mouth — the most common &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the condition occurs without another underlying autoimmune disease, it is classified as primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several types of immune cells may contribute to Sjögren’s. Broadly, these include B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which help coordinate the immune response and can kill infected or abnormal cells. Both are types of lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scientists looked for changes, patterns in immune cell types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some immune changes occur in specific tissues, dysregulation also affects lymphocytes circulating throughout the body. However, “the relationship between peripheral immune cell alterations and clinical outcomes is not fully understood,” the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify this relationship, the scientists assessed levels of several of T- and B-cell subtypes in blood samples from 43 people with primary Sjögren’s. Participants in this group had an average age of 43.5 and about 95% were female. A group of 46 participants without chronic inflammatory disorders, but with similar age and sex characteristics, served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, B-cell levels were significantly higher in the Sjögren’s patients than in controls, with elevated levels of one particular subtype, CD21-/low B-cells. This subtype is also present at high levels in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.535784/full"&gt;other chronic immune conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that higher levels of CD21-/low B-cells correlated with greater disease severity in this Sjögren’s population. Other subtypes of B-cells, on the other hand, were lower in the Sjögren’s patients than in the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate profound alterations in peripheral lymphocyte subsets in patients with [primary Sjögren’s], revealing distinct immune dysregulation patterns within T and B cell populations,” the researchers wrote. Alterations included significantly higher levels of certain immune cell subtypes and significantly lower levels of others. For some subtypes, levels correlated with disease severity as measured using the EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Altered levels of T-cell subtypes seen in Sjögren’s patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall levels of certain T cells, like T-helper (Th) and T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells, were similar between groups, patients with Sjögren’s showed altered levels of several T-cell subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, according to the researchers, Th2 and Th17 cells — types of helper T cells that coordinate immune responses — were significantly increased. These elevated Th2 and Th17 levels are consistent with their known roles in driving B cell hyperactivity and glandular inflammation, highlighting their contribution to early disease development, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, total cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, which target and kill damaged or infected cells, were significantly higher in the Sjögren’s group, and also correlated with more severe disease as measured by ESSAI scores, the data showed. The team also reported that the Tc1 and Tc17 subtypes were significantly decreased in patients compared with controls, and noted that higher Tc1 levels were associated with milder disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The identification of [these cell types] as potential mediators of disease activity, … highlights actionable pathways for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings may provide insight into the processes that cause primary Sjögren’s, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The identification of CD21−/low B cells as potential mediators of disease activity, alongside Th17 or Tc cell imbalances, highlights actionable pathways for further exploration,” the team wrote. These three cell types may provide biological markers of disease state and potential therapeutic targets, they noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the scientists say their findings “provide a foundation for understanding T and B cell dysfunction” in primary Sjögren’s, they add that “future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these observations and explore their therapeutic implications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted several limitations to the study, specifically that this disease population tended to have milder forms of Sjögren’s. People with more severe versions of the disease may show different patterns in immune dysregulation, the team cautioned. This could indicate different immune processes at play depending on disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;

Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR2" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package.

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet combines the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes those foods, with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is designed to lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks on the diet, men increased their protein and fiber intake, which may support muscle and digestive health. Women saw significant decreases in weight, waist circumference, and lean body mass. Those results indicate the diet may have influenced nutrition habits and body composition in different ways for men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the percentage of dietary fat and saturated fat decreased in both men and women, patients still ate more fats than recommended, indicating that “ensuring the recommended level of intake is important,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211034825003402"&gt;Effect of MIND diet on oxidative stress markers in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Healthy diet linked to slower disease progression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence highlights the benefits of a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; in slowing MS disease progression. For example, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/10/17/mediterranean-diet-associated-lower-disability-risk-study/"&gt;following a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is linked to a lower risk of disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers in Turkey wanted to see if the MIND diet could strengthen antioxidant defenses in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants help protect the body from oxidative stress, an imbalance between harmful molecules called free radicals and the body’s ability to neutralize them. By counteracting these molecules, which can trigger and sustain inflammation, antioxidants may help reduce inflammation and potentially slow the progression of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 30 patients with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt;. Most were not smokers (60%) and did not drink alcohol (83.3%), but the vast majority (93.3%) led a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They followed the MIND diet for eight weeks. They were also advised to limit red meat and processed meat products, as well as sugary, fried, and high-fat foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks, total antioxidant status — a measure of the body’s total ability to neutralize harmful free radicals — increased significantly. Although the levels of specific antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) didn’t increase significantly, they showed an upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men, body measurements didn’t change significantly. But women experienced a significant reduction in body weight, body mass index (a measure that uses height and weight to estimate body fat), and waist circumference by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women also had a significant reduction in total body bone-free lean mass, which refers to the body’s muscle mass without bones. This reduction could be a concern for muscle health, especially for patients who already face a higher risk of losing muscle mass, a condition known as sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted the importance of getting enough dietary protein — at least one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) — to help prevent muscle loss. Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men, daily protein intake increased from an average of 0.8 g/kg to 1 g/kg. In women, however, there were no significant changes. Overall, average dietary fiber intake increased significantly, which can improve the intestinal microbial composition and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total fat intake and saturated fat intake remained higher than recommended levels. Saturated fats, commonly found in fried and processed foods, are known to increase inflammation and oxidative stress, so reducing these is important for people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Findings of the study showed that the MIND diet may has positive effects on increasing the defense system against disease-related inflammation and oxidative stress,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:49:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVzZ5WTgtMzlTdXZ1bF9YWjhCN1c1SVV4aDJyaWF4eVlGOV9aZHpFQTRseWV0SHo5Z0dpWmVhR3cxbWFaay1ORUJxUHpBTXE3eXZGaEVBTGV1Z0I1amd1dGlGdk81YWdLaXhFRkdQbkNrSkNYS2VCeVF5U293aExFLWVRbzA3dzFUeEFYajVGeE5JNDFZSFY1RjZ5STduQXR6amktZ2ZfRmtIZjNYZHVlX2JhMk9tMWpyekE</guid></item><item><title>这种咳嗽糖浆成分实际上可能减缓痴呆症- Gizmodo | This Cough Syrup Ingredient Might Actually Slow Dementia - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPeGtTa0Q0ZC1wVlk5amFuaGJGTF9CRGJkVFlOd09WQmpGV0tUMktHMXpmS1Z3X2d6ZFhkRDhhMkI4T2lsMV9oZU1yc01KV3JEQzJUckR2S0RfeC1ZTm8wakFKc0Ztd0hmZGNpMzE5UGM1TnRGNkVtYmQ5Z0lzcnJKTVpyTFozX3UwU3h0S1JPTG0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Today’s cough syrup could turn into tomorrow’s treatment for Parkinson’s disease. Recent research in the U.K. is the latest to suggest that a common ingredient in cough syrup, ambroxol, might be able to slow down the progression of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at St. Joseph’s Health Care London conducted the year-long small study, which involved 55 patients with Parkinson’s-related dementia. The drug was safely tolerated and may have stabilized people’s symptoms, particularly people more genetically vulnerable to the neurodegenerative disease. Researchers elsewhere have already begun to test ambroxol for Parkinson’s and related dementias in larger trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;“These findings suggest &lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;Ambroxol&lt;/span&gt; may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist,” said study author Stephen Pasternak, a cognitive neuroscientist at Lawson Research Institute, the research arm of St. Joseph’s Health Care London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sjhc.london.on.ca/research/stories/landmark-study-investigates-potential-of-ambroxol-cough-medicine-to-slow"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/ambroxol.html"&gt;Ambroxol&lt;/a&gt; is commonly used as an expectorant in cough syrup, helping thin out mucus so people with respiratory illnesses can clear phlegm from their airways and breathe easier. But recently, scientists have speculated that it can also target a key driver of Parkinson’s, the accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have found that ambroxol can raise people’s levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), another protein that helps regulate the brain’s waste clearance system. In people with Parkinson’s, levels of GCase tend to decline as levels of abnormal alpha-synuclein rise. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.gaucherdisease.org/blog/gaucher-disease-and-parkinsons-what-to-know-now/"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; that people with certain genetic mutations affecting GCase function are at higher risk for Parkinson’s. Scientists have hoped that ambroxol can indirectly lower people’s alpha-synuclein by increasing GCase, reversing or at least slowing down the progression of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers randomized people with Parkinson’s-related dementia to either receive a placebo or a high dose of ambroxol (taken via pills daily) over a 12-month span. There were no severe symptoms linked to the drug’s use, the researchers found, and common adverse effects were typically gastrointestinal. People on placebo also experienced worsening psychiatric symptoms of their Parkinson’s and an increase in levels of GFAP (a blood marker of brain damage), whereas those on ambroxol appeared to stay about the same.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;“This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies,” Pasternak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s results, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2835760"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; late last month in JAMA Neurology, were not a clear home run, however. There was overall no difference in cognition between the placebo and treatment groups, for instance. People with GCase-related genetic mutations taking the drug may have experienced improved cognition, though the sample sizes were too small to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, enough evidence has built up that other scientists are taking a chance on ambroxol. There are at least &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05778617"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04588285"&gt;clinical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://neurologyopen.bmj.com/content/5/2/e000535"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; of the drug for Parkinson’s and similar conditions linked to GCase underway right now. The largest of these trials is testing ambroxol in over 300 people with Parkinson’s over a two-year span. It will take years for these studies to wrap up, but if successful, ambroxol could very well become the first treatment able to slow down the destruction caused by Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) recently &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=fab54cd7_1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:added;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; another one to its list of variants under monitoring: XFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;XFG is spreading most widely in Southeast Asia, although cases have been reported in 38 countries. In the U.K., it accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-signs-vaccine-uk-b2783498.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:30%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;30%&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 infections, and in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:14%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;14%&lt;/a&gt; of confirmed cases are XFG, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (These data are likely incomplete: the CDC notes that since less data are being reported, the variant trackers are not precise.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's what we know so far about XFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a "variant under monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This designation is the least urgent of WHO’s variant categories, which escalate from "variant under monitoring" to "variant of interest" to "variant of concern." But while variants under monitoring pose a low immediate risk to people, they show signs of being able to grow and potentially spread more easily than other circulating variants that don't get an official WHO designation. WHO is watching XFG closely, but it is so new that experts aren’t sure yet what the health consequences of such growth might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7292910/covid-symptoms-long-covid/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Still Not Feeling the Same After COVID-19?

It derives from the &lt;a href="https://time.com/6548748/jn1-covid-variant/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JN.1 Omicron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;JN.1 Omicron&lt;/a&gt; group, which is the target of the &lt;a href="https://time.com/7287451/fda-new-covid-19-vaccine-guidance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:latest COVID-19 vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;latest COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. XFG is a combination of two other variants that have recombined: LF.7 and LP.8.1.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It is growing globally. Samples of XFG sent to the global database of genetic virus sequences jumped from 7% of all COVID-19 samples in May 2025 to nearly 23% a few weeks later, according to WHO. Compared to the variant NB.1.8.1—which is currently dominant in many countries, including in the U.S.—XFG contains nine additional mutations in the spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Vaccines seem to work against it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists are currently studying how well people are protected against severe disease from XFG.

WHO says the genetic analysis of XFG also shows that antiviral drugs nirmatrelvir (&lt;a href="https://time.com/6553027/paxlovid-for-young-healthy-adults/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Paxlovid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Paxlovid&lt;/a&gt;) and remdesivir (Veklury) should also be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20What%20to%20Know%20About%20the%20New%20COVID-19%20Variant%20XFG&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7300451%2Fnew-covid-19-variant-xfg%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:28:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5FS0pBclpJMnpjdW9maFF4YXc3T3VaUTRUeGtkZTJJdnlldHp4TzR4OFRkV2l3SjhrZG1JSXhDN2lSVU5PYk9Ba24tOFhVUk5WR3BzR0xEaV9JRTFFTFZpMUEtYmRZMDlfVUNOdF9BTHNlNEFCN2c</guid></item><item><title>更年期的一个鲜为人知的副作用正在毁掉我的生活，医生不知道如何帮助我-每日邮报 | A little-known side effect of menopause is ruining my life and doctors don't know how to help me - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPaGEyWU5PTV9DRGZhd0hPTEg2bVhBR1RqakJVajlHMHZkM1pDTjI5Sl9xRmk4LW9XRWt5V3JRbUdBaWhTcmpSQ0pCemhudVlma0lKZnFOOXFQa0tVdHFsY00zZjg1WjlYWHB0UTRTNXVXSnN3ZVRGdGsyNkdfcWRURWNXNnpwd2luMDFWNV94eHFZMkp3MW9CVXgwdUTSAaIBQVVfeXFMT3Vvd2lGN2ZQYk96ZVFEa1pQU0k4UWZSdk1tSWx3bmpJZ2dnSGkyV1YzcEU4Um5BZnNkcHNGdHBqM0lJNENVNGJXckFpMHFPTEdPdGJqaEp4anRHZ3h4MERybEtjSi1WSDRvR3dmVW5aTzBUeXBQN0ozYjVsb3N3c2tMNlJmeWhVZWFNVTFCMkJqRkZpNFZEdERGTmZodktRUDR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little-known effect of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-749acc80-5b3d-11f0-813d-7d23ecea19cc"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; could turn subtle smells into foul odors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 45-year-old woman reported recently entering perimenopause, a precursor to menopause that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13932205/Experts-early-warning-signs-heading-menopause-hot-flushes.html"&gt;signals the end of a woman's reproductive years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noticed common signs like vaginal dryness and increased sweating, which she could easily remedy with more lubricant during sex and packing on deodorant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there's one symptom she hasn't found a fix for: her sense of smell 'is off the charts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous woman explained to an advice column that normally subtle smells like a person's breath or cheese in a closed fridge have become 'unbearable.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And her newfound sense of smell has also ruined her sex life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote: 'Worst of all, the smell of bodies has become extremely off-putting. I’m not talking about bad body odor—just regular human smells.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And despite being in a new relationship, the smell of her partner's 'skin, breath and hair turns my stomach.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An anonymous woman revealed how menopause has caused her sense of smell to become overly sensitive (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drop in estrogen and progesterone that causes the menopause has a vast array of effects on the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/07/perimenopause-smell-strong-sex-advice.html"&gt;Slate's advice column&lt;/a&gt;, the woman said: 'If I focus on the sensations in my body, I can sometimes put the smells out of my mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But other times, I just can’t, and I avoid any physical contact or even sitting too close to them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe perimenopause and menopause can alter a woman's sense of smell due to a dip in hormone levels, though it's unclear how common this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also unclear how many of the 75million US women undergoing menopause experience changes in smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perimenopause starts around a woman's mid to late 40s, roughly eight to 10 years before the onset of menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this time, the ovaries produce less estrogen and progesterone, which are responsible for regulating menstrual cycles and fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once hormones start to fluctuate, most women in perimenopause and menopause start having irregular or skipped periods, mood changes, low sex drive, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats and sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, estrogen and progesterone also help maintain the olfactory system, a group of structures including the nose, nasal cavities and olfactory nerve that control sense of smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones are thought to help regenerate olfactory sensory neurons and connect them to the olfactory bulb, the brain's smell processing center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some women, menopause may make the olfactory system less sensitive, but in others it could heighten these senses.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unnamed woman in the advice column wrote: 'I’ve tried showering with them before sex to see if that helps (it doesn’t) and using scented products on my own skin to see if I can drown out their smell (I can’t). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know it’s me, and they smell perfectly normal.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman also noted she feels self-conscious bringing up the issue to her new partner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, menopausal women may experience phantosmia, or smelling odors that aren't actually there. It makes up about 10 to 20 percent of disorders that affect sense of smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Menopausal women with a heightened sense of smell can use air purifiers to help reduce lingering odors and try to use unscented products whenever possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has also been shown to alleviate menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, and anecdotal evidence suggests it could normalize sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are no medications or concrete treatments for the side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Creatine may also offer benefits tied to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine can help ease fatigue during your period by supporting stable energy levels,” Rupar continued, “especially when you’re feeling more tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate the menstrual cycle, influence how the body produces and uses creatine, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the menstrual cycle, creatine levels can change, and supplements may help keep energy and muscle function more stable, especially when oestrogen is low,” Rupar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 fcVRZz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-16783"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

posted on her &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel earlier this year, Dr. Jen Claude weighed in on the question of how much me-time is too much me-time, and her answer might surprise a few people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often should you masturbate?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Well, I've got some perhaps good news for you," she began. "Before I give you the answer let me remind you that masturbation is perfectly fine, okay? Masturbation actually can be a very healthy part of overall life and fulfilment, so I don't want you to think that masturbation is not okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Claude went on to state that the 'truth of the matter is: masturbate as much as you want', because there's 'no hard and fast answer' - pun probably not intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Masturbating as much as you like is recommended by a professional (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"There's not a top limit threshold. It's nothing like 'oh you can't masturbate more than this amount of times,' there's not a lower threshold, there's not a number of times in a day, a week, a month," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Certain people masturbate multiple times a day, some people masturbate only certain times every few months depending on whatever. Some people masturbate when they're in a certain mood, some people masturbate at other times, it just depends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She did warn that it's paramount not to let masturbation interfere with the rest of your life, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The only caveat [is] you can masturbate as much as you want so long as it doesn't interfere with your daily life; it doesn't interfere with your mental wellbeing, it does not interfere with your relationships; interfere with your ability to go to your job or lead a happy, healthy, productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"In certain situations you can see how masturbation becomes compulsive, in which case we say that you need to be evaluated, you need to discuss this with a licensed professional, okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;There are plenty of benefits (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of masturbation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Masturbating in the morning can be an energy boost, didn't you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Sham Singh of The Handy &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/when-how-often-masturbation-health-benefits-doctor-explains-467675-20250430"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt;: "There isn't a certain time of day that’s better than any other, so it’s better for people to find their 'ideal' time that suits them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But it turns out that there are benefits to masturbating at certain times in the day, depending on what you're looking to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“For example, some might find it easier to sleep after masturbation at night because of the hormones released, which can help bring on relaxation. Others might prefer to do it in the morning because they find it energising," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As for how this act of self-care improves sleep and relieves stress, the doctor explained: When it comes to physical aspects, it can relieve muscle tension, help to improve the state of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and even relieve premenstrual tension caused by menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It may also be understood as a minor psychological and stress-relieving exercise. Exploring one's body and preferences can also enable better communication and satisfaction in sexual relationships,” he mentioned as a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; bonus. "Looking into the science of it, masturbating can stimulate the release of endorphins and other happy neurotransmitters that may include dopamine and oxytocin, thus increasing mood and reducing anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Masturbation also aids in the relief of menstrual pain for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The contractions of the uterus as a result of an orgasm are then followed by relaxation, which can relieve cramping," Dr. Singh noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when you stop masturbating?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/what-happens-if-you-stop-masturbating-body-brain-403629-20240527"&gt;According to an anonymous sex writer&lt;/a&gt;, there's so many ways that lack of masturbation can affect you and those around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mood swings for one. "Masturbation withdrawal may sound far-fetched, but masturbation releases a delicious cocktail of feel-good chemicals and hormones and whatnots, so it seemed reasonable to me that my body was all like, 'Hey where'd that awesome stuff go?'" she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There's an extended period of untamed arousal too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The build-up to satisfaction went from minutes to days, sometimes a week," she revealed of her own experiences. "Orgasm became an event to be longed for and fantasised about instead of another item to check off my to-do list like dry-cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Now when I found myself unexpectedly in the mood, my thoughts turned to 'Won't it be nice when my boyfriend gets home...' instead of 'Where the hell did I put that Hitachi Magic wand?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Pestering of your partner is certainly a side effect you want to avoid, as this'll really start to grate on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The writer said that she ended up 'getting a little desperate' after a while and joked that despite her other half being mostly happy to comply, he wasn't 'always in the mood to act as a member of my personal stud farm'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She signed off with: "Dignity flies out the window when you're desperate to get down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:12:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQNHcxR1lPYWtaR0sxMVJCX2JLTENXUVA3bUx3d1Z5ZlJaREowVmU5V0RJcXBzdExJeVN2SDBGT2NUMlZVOXNEd1VZRFVtM1VObHhMYXhRVXpwbFd0QS14cngtTjFZcGlSZmZnWkMzb1dKcV9CeXRJNEN5bkFMUWJoeDlFZFFPOWZZbEpxNS16UTRIeFlieWNHT2x6Mk1QYXozN3Vr</guid></item><item><title>“冰箱香烟”是Z世代对健怡可乐的新痴迷，让健康专家感到担忧- AOL.com | 'Fridge cigarette' is Gen Z's new Diet Coke obsession that concerns health experts - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBWSHlXSEp6Vk8xSFdjdFV3V2o0c0JlVGZ0M3ZVXzJyNXNFX0Q3T05EU3NheE5zWHJkWmhicC00cFJ2MWwxc3JxNUQtOXgzbUZiMWRsYmhGb0hXZHJKSXhCTEhsZTJONTlwLWN6RVExaFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-afternoon cigarette break has taken a new form for Gen Z with a sweet, bubbly twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos about "fridge cigarettes" have garnered hundreds of thousands of likes on TikTok this summer as scores of young adults have raved about the pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix is &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/soft-drinks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet soda,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diet soda,&lt;/a&gt; particularly Diet Coke — chilled to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/experts-say-quitting-diet-coke-can-improve-heart-health-gut-balance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Experts Say Quitting Diet Coke Can Improve Heart Health And Gut Balance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts Say Quitting Diet Coke Can Improve Heart Health And Gut Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a little something to take the edge off," one &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt; of a Diet Coke can read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Time for my afternoon fridge cigarette," another said of the same soda brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Thanks to a viral TikTok trend, 20-somethings across America are reaching for refrigerated diet sodas instead of cigarettes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third video caption reads, "Fridge cigarette after a long day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the appeal behind the TikTok trend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Alpert, a psychotherapist based in New York City, said the trend works because Diet Coke can act as an "emotional stand-in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coca-cola-announces-new-orange-cream-flavor-iconic-nostalgic-taste" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Coca-cola Announces New Orange Cream Flavor: 'Iconic And Nostalgic Taste';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coca-cola Announces New Orange Cream Flavor: 'Iconic And Nostalgic Taste'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It becomes a way [for people] to pause, reset or reward themselves," the expert told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It's] a small ritual that offers structure or comfort in the middle of a hectic day.

							&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated by people who seem to defy the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the airbrushed celebrities or the ones who live on green juice and fillers—but regular people who, even in their sixties and seventies, look and move like they’re a decade younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dozens of conversations, some travel observations, and way too much time spent reading behavioral science studies, I’ve noticed something interesting: it’s not just about good genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about what they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;—day in, day out. And often, it’s not the obvious stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the overlooked habits that seem to keep people youthful, inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They walk—every single day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-surprising-benefits-of-walking"&gt;Dr. Thomas Frieden&lt;/a&gt;, former CDC director, once said, "Walking is the closest thing we have to a wonder drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;It sounds almost too simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nearly every youthful older person I’ve met swears by their daily walk. Not for the cardio points. Not to hit a step goal. Just for the rhythm of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiologically speaking, this simple habit does a lot -- it improves circulation, supports joint health, boosts mood, and helps regulate sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman I met in Lisbon, well into her seventies, took long neighborhood strolls twice a day. She claimed her knees had never given her trouble. More importantly, walking kept her mentally sharp. "You see people. You feel the world move," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you walk daily, you notice things. You stay mentally engaged with your environment. You’re not just surviving the day; you’re interacting with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They eat in a way that doesn’t stress their body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about trendy biohacking or restrictive meal plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve seen is that youthful older adults tend to eat in a way that feels calm, not chaotic. Their meals are consistent, nourishing, and not driven by impulse or emotional eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of them eat lots of plants, fiber, and whole foods. They don’t eat like they’re trying to undo a binge. They eat like they’re in a relationship with their body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about perfection—it’s about rhythm. A bowl of lentil soup. Some fruit and nuts. A glass of red wine without guilt. They enjoy food but don’t abuse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is backed by research too. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250220/Eating-more-flavonoids-may-slow-aging-and-boost-brain-health-study-finds.aspx#:~:text=The%20results%20indicate%20that%20flavonoid,science/article/pii/S0002916525000784"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that a high intake of flavonoids—compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and teas—was associated with slower aging. Not only that, they also improve skin elasticity over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They stay curious about new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve noticed about people who age well? They never get stuck in the "back in my day" mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they stay open. They learn new apps, try new foods, pick up random hobbies. They might not master them all, but they don’t close the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity isn’t just a mindset—it’s a practice. It &lt;a href="https://fullfocus.co/the-science-of-curiosity/"&gt;keeps the brain elastic&lt;/a&gt;. It fuels novelty and breaks routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man I met at a photography workshop in Santa Fe—aged 68—was learning drone photography just because it looked fun. "Why not?" he shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That curiosity keeps their minds sharp and their energy fresh. It signals flexibility. And let’s face it—people who embrace change just feel younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They protect their sleep like it’s sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone needs eight hours, but everyone needs &lt;em&gt;restorative&lt;/em&gt; sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve met folks in their sixties who look fresh-faced not because of what they do during the day, but because of how well they sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They keep screens out of the bedroom. They wind down before bed. They respect their circadian rhythm instead of bulldozing through it with caffeine and late-night scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also treat bedtime like a ritual. Herbal teas. Reading physical books. Keeping the lights dim in the evening. These small habits add up to serious rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? Their skin looks better. Their moods are more stable. Their eyes sparkle. That’s not coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They keep their stress levels in check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some use meditation. Others garden. Some just know when to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what they don’t do: carry stress like a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7400286/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that chronic stress accelerates cellular aging. It affects sleep, digestion, mood, and hormone regulation. Over time, it shows—on your face, in your posture, and in how you respond to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also seem to have boundaries. They say no without apology. They unplug without guilt. That kind of energy conservation is a huge reason why they glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They move in ways that feel joyful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of them are gym rats. In fact, most aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they dance in the kitchen. They stretch in the morning. They swim, hike, bike, or play ping pong. The key is consistency and enjoyment—not obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One guy I met in Italy swore that his nightly habit of dancing to jazz records kept his joints loose. And honestly, he moved like someone twenty years younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of movement keeps muscles engaged, joints fluid, and hormones balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it releases endorphins. And endorphins don’t just make you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; good—they make you &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; good, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They spend time with people who make them laugh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youthful older adults tend to have people around them who energize them. Not drain them. Not compete with them. Not gossip with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t just hang out—they &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt;. They share stories. They laugh until their cheeks hurt. They surround themselves with people who bring lightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who laugh together, stay younger together. There’s science behind that too. Research from the &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2020/12/scientific-proof-that-laughter-really-can-be-the-best-medicine/#:~:text=By%20activating%20the%20neural%20pathways,and%20increases%20vulnerability%20to%20diseases."&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; found that laughter produces positive emotions that lead to flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of mental buoyancy shows up on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They use sunscreen—but they don’t obsess&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, sunscreen became either a religion or a rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the people I’ve met who look great in their sixties? They use it. Not in a fear-based way. Just in a consistent, practical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand that cumulative sun damage is a thing. But they also don’t panic over a walk on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They aim for balance. A little sun, a little barrier. That’s the energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they usually don’t overdo skincare routines either. Just enough to keep the skin clean, protected, and moisturized. Minimal effort, maximum return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They hydrate like it’s their job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water affects everything—from skin texture to digestion to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The youthful folks I’ve chatted with have made a habit of drinking water throughout the day. Some flavor it with lemon or mint. Others track it loosely. But they make hydration a non-negotiable part of their rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a small habit with a massive ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. They never stop expressing themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;This might be the most underrated one of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who age well don’t let the world tell them they’re too old to be seen. They show up in bold colors, clever captions, and quirky playlists. They find ways to say, "This is who I am," without needing anyone’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might look like painting again after decades. Or swapping out a boring jacket for one with some personality. Or just telling better, wilder stories at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treat self-expression as fuel. And in doing so, they remind everyone around them that being vibrant is a choice—not a stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying youthful into your sixties and beyond isn’t just about avoiding wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about energy, presence, and engagement with life. And most of that comes down to the small, repeatable things you do—not the big, flashy ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with one. See how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the fifth most common form of cancer worldwide, killing an estimated 770,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic infection with H. pylori is a major cause, and it helps explain the rise in stomach cancers among young people in recent years, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are infected with H. pylori as children, and they may be infected for years without knowing it because the infection doesn’t cause symptoms. But it can also cause ulcers or inflammation in the stomach lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can spread by mouth, for example kissing, or through contact with vomit or stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where stomach cancer cases will rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) cancer research agency analysed stomach cancer data from 185 countries in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They projected that under current trends, 11.9 million people could be diagnosed with stomach cancer attributable to H. pylori infection by 2101, which is the year someone born in 2017 would turn 84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of bacteria-linked stomach cancer cases – 8 million – are expected in Asia. Another nearly 471,000 cases are projected in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burden of stomach cancer is also shifting globally. While sub-Saharan Africa currently has relatively few cases, the researchers expect stomach cancer cases tied to H. pylori to rise to 1.4 million by 2101 – six times higher than the rate in 2022 – due to ageing and population changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With demographic changes set to increase the gastric cancer burden in many parts of the world, there is an urgent need for coordinated prevention strategies and for regional health systems to be prepared to manage the growing burden,” said Dr Jin Young Park, one of the study’s co-authors and head of the gastric cancer prevention team at the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations, notably poor data quality in lower-income countries that can make it harder to make confident predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers said the data is clear enough for health authorities around the world to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They called for countries to invest in initiatives to screen and quickly treat people for H. pylori infection. Their analysis shows that such programmes could reduce the number of expected stomach cancer cases by up to 75 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is essential that health authorities make gastric cancer prevention a priority and accelerate efforts to control it,” Park said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxORmpIMlo0M3d3MjBOelp2Tk9CbUF2TllqMnNvSVJQcVpuUDdDRnhlNEV2dFkzOEc1MUpreU9RemNqRGlJVlpLZGJyN1JuV0tuaU5yR1h1SGhSRlJsMWQydkNBN2RURExqUmRWbzlGcFRYY0xOSEpRMDZlWGN5Z2hWdENHbFBKeWdHTFkzelRmSllhMGxYQVFZa2V0TUwxbDBURFp2QjhWZlBWSnFDTGE0WFBQRWhxODUzR053VkoxMlhpb0hTWTFIRmktc3lzQQ</guid></item><item><title>10种可以控制高皮质醇水平的食物-印度时报 | 10 foods that can control high cortisol levels - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;​Diabetes: 10 smart fruit choices to hel...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;10 benefits of eating a bowl of boiled c...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:37:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>育儿建议：我想帮助我的家人度过医疗紧急情况。但不是这样的。-石板 | Parenting advice: I want to help my family through a medical emergency.

Have you ever thought about writing into Care and Feeding? Now’s the time—our inbox is in need of more questions! Conundrums big and small are welcome, and of course, it’s anonymous. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeI516MVbV7en9S-8krL2zppY_GWq-qad7K_P7iUvxcD7t6vA/viewform"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit your family and parenting questions to Care and Feeding here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Or your questions about anything else to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2023/06/advice-columns-submit-questions.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;other columns here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnxfr03001j3b6hnelu9e7k@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Care and Feeding, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7ulgu00093b76z4u1jomq@published"&gt;My brother and his wife live nearby, and our kids get along well. We definitely have different parenting styles, but we talk through them. We’re comfortable with this, and we often host each other’s children for the day. There’s one major difference: Our kids (ages 3 and 5) are sleep trained, but my brother and sister-in-law never sleep trained their 5-year-old son, “Pete.” They’ve mentioned having to get up with him several times a night. Pete seems fine otherwise, and since it was their choice, I left it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7unw9000f3b768lo9gelc@published"&gt;But now that’s changing. They’ve asked us to take Pete for a while when his baby brother is born, and we haven’t really said “yes” because we’re trying to figure out how to handle it. My SIL is in her third trimester and found out that the birth will be complicated. Their baby will, at minimum, spend time in the NICU. It’s scary, and we’re all hoping everything goes well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7ur8j000l3b76dvnywvi8@published"&gt;It feels cruel to tell them to sleep train a 5-year-old in the last months of a difficult pregnancy, or else we can’t babysit him. But it also won’t get easier once the baby is born. If it were only two or three nights, we’d manage, but we’re probably going to be caring for Pete for longer stretches in that first month, unless the birth goes miraculously well. My husband’s work shifts mean sleep is precious in our household. I’m usually the nighttime parent, and I cannot be getting up multiple times every night, outside of emergencies and regular parenting stuff.&lt;br&gt;All this will already be a series of hard transitions for Pete. How do we approach the conversation with my brother and SIL?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7v0fq00133b76qtgl0poa@published"&gt;As tricky as this is, your brother and his wife are in an emergency medical situation they neither asked for nor planned for. This is a time when you need to step up. You don’t have to turn your own life totally upside down, but you should be prepared to make some adjustments or concessions. By asking questions and setting expectations now, you can help make the transition smoother for everyone. So, go ahead and say yes, but ask for a chat about the specifics of what caring for Pete might actually look like. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmco7v4pm00193b76fn9vqvdw@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they willing to let you set boundaries around Pete’s nighttime waking? Are they open to using tools like an OK-to-Wake clock, or placing a nightly limit on how many times he can get out of bed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of those boundaries lead to sleep training Pete—whether inadvertently or intentionally on your part—are they OK with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the waking is due to bedwetting, what kinds of interventions (mattress pads, special pajamas, wetness sensors) have they tried, or would they be open to you exploring?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long do they anticipate this arrangement lasting? What happens if they need to extend it? And what happens if they need more time, but you can’t accommodate it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the nighttime waking becomes too much and you need help, are they willing to contribute financially to a solution, like hiring a nighttime nanny or flying in a grandma to give you a respite? (I truly hope this isn’t necessary for a 5-year-old, but covering all bases here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnxfvqf001o3b6hamhvoq8t@published"&gt;Let’s also acknowledge that Pete might do &lt;em&gt;great &lt;/em&gt;in a new environment, simply because you aren’t his parents and his routine will be different. He also might regress. Either way, knowing ahead of time what kind of freedom you’ll have to manage any challenges will allow you to be nimble in the moment. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

My parents divorced when I was 8 because my dad simply couldn’t deal with her erratic behavior anymore. (Some of her episodes involved chaining herself to a traffic light and threatening to jump off the roof of our house.) He was awarded sole custody of my sister and me. My mother was unable to hold a job and couldn’t pay child support. Her (supervised) visits eventually stopped, even before she was admitted for inpatient treatment. My sister was less than 2 years old when our mom dropped out of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7wxkv001k3b76iaz2iwp4@published"&gt;Now, our mother has contacted us out of the blue, saying she wants a relationship. I am convinced she’s looking for a place to crash, someone to support her, or both. I have refused contact—I have two kids under 5 and no desire to put them in physical or emotional danger. My sister, however, is very excited over the prospect. She was too young to remember how unstable and terrifying our mom’s presence was, and I’m extremely concerned she’ll get hurt if she lets our mom back into her life. How can I get my sister to face reality?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7x37n001w3b76v7b9yax2@published"&gt;This is a situation where you might need to get out of your sister’s way, while still helping her stay as safe as possible. As you said, she doesn’t have any memories from when things with your mom were really bad, and there is a big difference between hearing about it and experiencing it firsthand. Even at your most persuasive, I wonder whether your accounts of the past would be enough to convince her to walk away now; it’s very possible that your sister has been fantasizing about this kind of reunion for years. And though you may be right about your mother’s motives, it’s also conceivable that you are wrong—so I’m not sure forbidding your sister from finding out for herself is in anyone’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7x62000203b76kbkh6idu@published"&gt;All that aside, it is absolutely appropriate for you to set your own boundaries and be skeptical about your mother’s motives. Focus on equipping your sister with the knowledge she needs, so she doesn’t go into the meeting with rose-colored glasses. Discuss your concerns, identify warning signs to look out for, and make a plan for the boundaries your sister will maintain. For example, maybe she promises not to give your mother money. If your mom asks for any, then you and your sister can discuss it together.&lt;/p&gt;

I think there is a way to protect yourself and your sister while remaining open to the possibility that your mom has made progress. Good luck with whatever you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7xhni002d3b76dsuo2ywk@published"&gt;My wife “Anling” has a fear of germs that borders on irrational. She keeps our 3-year-old son “Joseph” meticulously clean and won’t allow him to do normal kid things like roll around in the grass or play in the sand at the park. (My parents even bought him a kiddie sandbox, but Anling made me give it back to them.) She vacuums the entire house every single day and insists on changing Joseph’s clothes and bathing him every time they return from running errands. I don’t go along with any of this when I’m caring for our son on my own, but if Anling sees even a smudge of dirt on him, I get blasted.&lt;/p&gt;

The birds there (pigeons and seagulls) are very habituated to people, so I gave Joseph some popcorn to feed the pigeons while we waited for Anling to come back from the restroom. The pigeons ate right out of Joseph’s hands, and he was delighted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7xljc002l3b768fdk6wb4@published"&gt;The fun ended when my wife returned. She came running over, shouting and waving her arms to scare the birds away, then took hand sanitizer from her purse and slathered it all over Joseph’s hands and arms while he cried. Anling then caused a scene, berating me and calling me a “moron,” and said it would be my fault if our son got bird flu. She made us leave for home that day.&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond depriving our son of normal childhood experiences and making him anxious, I’m concerned she is setting him up for allergies and a weakened immune system, since he’s never exposed to anything. I’m ready to give Anling an ultimatum: Either she eases up, or we go our separate ways. Is that the right approach?&lt;/p&gt;

The goal isn’t to prove that she is “broken,” but to gently demonstrate how her behaviors are impacting you and your son.&lt;br&gt;If she acknowledges there’s a problem, the next step isn’t her “easing up” as you put it, but seeking individual and family therapy to learn some new coping skills.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnxgjk200293b6hmfsk0wet@published"&gt;I have a 14-year-old stepson whom I first met when he was a toddler. He spent weekends with his father and me until he was 7, when he moved in with us because his mom moved out of state and we were awarded physical custody. When we got married several years ago, I asked him what he wanted to call me, and he said “Mom.” He is smart, bright, funny, and generous, and he has a heart of gold. He deserves to have present, loving parents as much as every single kid out there does. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/02/stepson-love-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;And yet, I do not love him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that people with generalized anxiety disorder may have poorer emotion recognition abilities. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1506239"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD, is a mental health condition characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities. People with GAD often expect that important events will turn out badly and worry excessively about health, work, family, or finances—even when there is little or no reason to do so. This chronic worry is difficult to control and typically persists for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common physical symptoms include restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, irritability, and sleep disturbances. GAD can impair concentration and interfere with daily functioning and relationships. It belongs to a group of mental health conditions known as anxiety disorders. Estimates suggest that about 5.6% of people in China suffer from anxiety disorders, with 1.3% specifically affected by GAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yuqi Shen and her colleagues aimed to compare affective control abilities in individuals with GAD and healthy participants. They hypothesized that difficulties in processing emotional information might play a role in the disorder. More specifically, they expected that affective inhibition and affective shifting would be linked to self-reported mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 50 individuals diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and 50 healthy control participants. In each group, 14 participants were female. The average age in the GAD group was 47 years, compared to 50 years in the healthy control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed standardized assessments of anxiety (the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), affective inhibition (using the Affective Flanker Task), and affective shifting (using the Affective Flexibility Task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affective inhibition refers to the ability to suppress or ignore emotionally distracting information in order to stay focused on relevant tasks or goals. Affective flexibility, or shifting, refers to the ability to switch attention and responses between different emotional stimuli or tasks (such as identifying emotions versus counting people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that individuals with GAD exhibited atypical patterns of affective inhibition. More specifically, they showed reduced proactive control—the ability to prepare and maintain focus on a task—and enhanced reactive control, which reflects a heightened response to conflicting or distracting emotional stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, people with GAD had more difficulty staying focused on emotionally relevant information and were more reactive to emotional distractions. They also had greater difficulty shifting attention between different task demands, particularly when those tasks involved emotional content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In sum, we found evidence that patients with GAD exhibit deficits in cognitive control within affective contexts compared to healthy adults. By measuring participants in two subcomponents of affective control (affective inhibition and affective shifting), we discovered that GAD patients show poorer emotion recognition abilities and impaired affective shifting functions,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the specificities of affective functioning in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any definitive cause-and-effect conclusions to be derived from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1506239"&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder patients’ cognitive control in affective contexts&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Yuqi Shen, Shasha Zhu, Shiqi Liao, Yuqing Zhao, Zihan Lin, Ke Jiang, Wenjing Yan, and Xinhua Shen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:12:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQeHNYUG4zVTVKNVFvR3dFM1dRTFlQdmhNbnNhU3ZFbUhOOXduZGhRRDRXamkwa0E3SDJYUkl1anpQNzVPUXZqdGc3bkt4ekFwV2hBV1E1MWMyeGo2Y1UwYUY3T1lEYnlFNF9BX2ZmZWVXaFA4b3I1ZzhXSDVXQnY4UkRXZGJaaENmVXVqb1NoZzQ1N0l2T0lPR3E5cVl3VzB4RDAwdm1Ncw</guid></item><item><title>专栏|我是一名胃肠病学家。这就是我告诉我的病人吃这种水果的原因。-《华盛顿邮报》 | Column | I’m a gastroenterologist.

Gut symptoms like bloating and constipation are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917991/" target="_blank"&gt;incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, affecting up to a third of the population. Many people don’t want to take medication if there are more natural ways to help. But I also know that simply recommending people &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/09/healthier-food-diet-advice/" target="_blank"&gt;increase their fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; is vague and not always useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GFOXN2HO4RFHFIPSCHNM45JGYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I’ve been “prescribing” a dose of two kiwis a day to my patients for years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4IZ5ZIXYYVGBFFRCBQ6C36OZM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A small but mighty green or gold fruit, kiwis are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/77434/download" target="_blank"&gt;bursting with nutrients&lt;/a&gt;: A single kiwi contains 80 percent or more of an adult’s daily vitamin C requirement and packs two to four grams of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/13/legume-pasta-edamame-low-carb/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to vitamins E and K and other beneficial antioxidants and phytochemicals, one of the kiwi’s most important properties is an enzyme called actinidin. Actinidin is present in only a few dietary sources besides kiwis (including mango and pineapple), and it can help break down proteins, aiding in our digestion. Actinidin is so powerful that it’s used commercially as a meat tenderizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YBSCQRCWDBAKXPMRPTRBJ67CP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So how does this help your gut?

These compounds are known to protect against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522030064" target="_blank"&gt;cancer, cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/27/2/362/28291/Dietary-Antioxidant-Intake-and-Risk-of-Type-2" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes.&lt;/a&gt; But — and this is a big one — it’s an effect that mainly appears to occur through a healthy diet — and not through antioxidant supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A4NIAVRXEJFU3IOQ4KIO5L4P7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As is often the case with other &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/31/supplements-benefits-research-science/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, when you try to distill the compound of interest into a capsule or pill, that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17327526/" target="_blank"&gt;beneficial health effect&lt;/a&gt; of antioxidants vanishes — and may even be potentially harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJHZZUKM4FF6VL2R3C7HBGEPAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists suspect that the kiwi’s antioxidants, like vitamin C, synergize with its other naturally occurring phytochemicals to boost its protective power — something we lose when we distill these nutrients into a commercialized supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="5ZBJXROZRNHUVEKAWO4COUB6FA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="5ZBJXROZRNHUVEKAWO4COUB6FA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Kiwi’s benefits may go beyond the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RXYZ5QQLFNCJFFRVT7JPNXP2XQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2011, Norwegian researchers randomized healthy volunteers to a month of eating either one or two &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21586177/" target="_blank"&gt;gold kiwis daily&lt;/a&gt;.

Trust me, it won’t happen. And for many people, prunes can actually make bloating &lt;i&gt;worse &lt;/i&gt;due to high levels of sorbitol, a naturally occurring sugar that gets fermented by your colon’s microbiome. That’s why I tend to recommend kiwis instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="F3YEZYTGZ5C43D7QOBWNPOG2VQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="F3YEZYTGZ5C43D7QOBWNPOG2VQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;What I want my patients to know&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XVT6XTIS6BEMLNSXNSECE6VXRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No, you don’t have to eat the kiwi’s peel. Plenty of studies have found notable health benefits &lt;i&gt;sans&lt;/i&gt; peel. But if you feel so inclined, go on, have a little nibble on the skin. It’s totally edible and packed with fiber. Just be sure to keep your doctor in the loop about your gut issues. For lots of people, the underlying condition causing their symptoms is past the point of a simpler dietary intervention. It’s why it’s important to find a doctor you trust who can consider multiple angles in approaching your health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-raw_html" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-cbTFcs wpds-c-cbTFcs-iPJLV-css" data-qa="raw-html"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drug target is a molecule, typically a protein, within the body that’s often involved in disease processes. Some of the newly discovered proteins are targeted by existing non-MS drugs, suggesting these therapies may be repurposed to treat MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery was reported in the study, “&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425537122"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiomics integration prioritizes potential drug targets for multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate significant potential for both the discovery of new drugs and the repurposing of existing ones,” Yuan Jiang, a PhD candidate at the Karolinska Institute and the study’s first author, said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/new-potential-drug-targets-for-multiple-sclerosis-identified"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is marked by inflammatory damage to healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. While several &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; (DMTs) are available to manage the disease by reducing the frequency and severity of relapses and delaying disability progression, more effective therapies are needed, especially for people with progressive forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Identifying proteins, looking for roles in MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Continuous exploration of drug discovery, development, and repurposing has become increasingly crucial for improving both the efficacy and the safety of MS treatment,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify candidate proteins linked to MS, the Karolinska researchers first conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS), a method that looks for relationships between protein levels in the blood and brain and MS susceptibility. Here, 100 proteins in the blood and 212 proteins in brain tissue had levels that were significantly associated with MS susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A technique called summary-data-based Mendelian randomization was then used to determine whether any of the proteins identified by PWAS played a causal role in MS. Overall, nine blood and nine brain proteins were considered causal and thus potential drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the blood proteins, CR1 and WARS were associated with an increased risk of MS, whereas TNFRSF1A, FCRL3, TYMP, PGLYRP1, CD59, IDUA, and ARHGAP1 were linked with a reduced risk of MS. In the brain, HLA-B, ZC2HC1A, HMGCL, TSFM, FAM120B, TRAF3, and MTHFR were tied to an increased risk of MS, while ICA1L and AUH were associated with a decreased MS risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed that blood proteins were mostly produced by immune cells involved in MS, while brain proteins were mostly sourced to nerve cells and other supportive brain cells such as oligodendrocytes, the cells that produces myelin in the brain and spinal cord, astrocytes, and blood vessel cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subsequent analysis found that five of the nine blood drug targets interacted with 19 known targets of 10 approved MS medications. Likewise, two of the nine brain drug targets interacted with five known drug targets of six MS therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the blood-based targets and two brain-based targets were also targeted by 16 existing drugs not used in MS, “suggesting potential opportunities for drug repurposing,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By integrating large-scale … data and applying advanced statistical methods, we have been able to prioritize drug targets that may improve the treatment of MS,” Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;

Apart from getting it from foods, Vitamin D is also synthesised in the body when exposed to sunlight and hence it is also called the "sunshine vitamin". However, a large number of people across the world suffer from Vitamin D deficiency, often without even knowing it. This deficiency is mainly due to poor diets and limited sun exposure, and it can lead to more than just fatigue or low mood— it’s been linked to several serious health issues, some of which can be long-term or even life-threatening if ignored.

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Yet my personal life was in tatters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while all that was taking off, behind closed doors my personal life was slowly falling apart. Admittedly, there were already cracks in my six-year-old marriage when I was drinking. Midlife marriages can be complicated; I had&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;four step-children and my ex-wife had undergone cancer – more than once. I can’t have been easy to live with, and fundamentally we were cut from different cloth. Stopping drinking wasn’t a miraculous cure-all. My issues (a complicated childhood, a turbulent relationship which led to me constantly getting absolutely plastered, sleeping rough for four nights on the beach and culminated in the pain of my mum’s death in 2018) were all still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once sober I started seeing life in full 4K, realising what I did and didn’t want. So by 2022 my marriage was over and we’d separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I packed my bags and left our London house, we both knew it was for the best. But it was unsettling, especially without alcohol as my trusty crutch any more, and with all the financial stress divorce brings. After moving around in-between rentals and hotels for the next year or so, I eventually bought my own place in the East Midlands. But I didn’t have many friends there, so apart from work (I now coach people online as well as give talks in schools, companies and for the Blue Light professions) life could sometimes feel fragile. I’d take Rosie, my dog, out for long, lonely walks thinking about life. But here’s the truth – while I’d remained sober throughout an emotional roller-coaster, I’d secretly swapped the booze addiction &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/life-with-food-addiction/"&gt;for a sugar one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one admits that swapping one addiction for another is incredibly common. Whether it’s food (like me) or shopping, work, exercise, social media – we all reach for something, people I meet in recovery circles all say the same thing. We’re all a bunch of hypocrites because we’re all human!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;I swapped my beer gut for a food belly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portion control was a problem, I thought I was being healthy having a weighty bowl of granola and Greek yoghurt in the morning, but I’d ladle on so much honey that breakfast alone was probably 700 calories. The bowl would weigh a tonne. Or I’d eat cinnamon buns, or wholemeal toast but slathered with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch might be four chicken thighs with jacket potato and salad (and I’d polish my halo), then I’d tuck into a huge steak and chips for dinner – enough to feed an entire rugby team. I wasn’t a bad cook, it wasn’t like I’d left all that to my wife during marriage, but I was naive about portion sizes and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evenings, I’d come home from a long day talking to people about alcohol addiction and scoff a family-sized apple crumble with vast amounts of ice cream&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; nipping back for more until – ah, f--k it – I’d finish the lot. “I’m allowed treats, I’ve stopped boozing,” I’d tell myself. But just like my drinking had stopped being something sociable by the end, so too had my eating. It was something I’d privately binge for a dopamine hit, along with a huge dollop of shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ballooned back up to 19st 8lb through comfort eating, yet all the while I was out there giving talks, helping people get sober. I felt like a greedy fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Though it's now clear humans continue to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adults-grow-new-brain-cells-and-they-help-us-learn-through-listening"&gt;grow new brain cells&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-neurons-are-still-developing-in-our-brains-even-when-we-re-80-years-old"&gt;their entire lives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/adult-human-brains-dont-grow-new-neurons-in-hippocampus-contrary-to-prevailing-view-93123"&gt;debate persists&lt;/a&gt; over whether this applies to specific areas involved with memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have made the case &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0375-9"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0676-20.2020"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the existence of neurogenesis in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; beyond childhood. &lt;/span&gt;A new study now offers some of the clearest evidence yet that this crucial memory-forming region does form fresh neurons well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the work of researchers from the Karolinska Institute and the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and looks specifically at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; section of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that acts as a key control center for emotions, learning, and storing episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-identifies-unexpected-part-of-your-brain-thats-uniquely-human?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Study Identifies Unexpected Part of Your Brain That's Uniquely Human&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives us an important piece of the puzzle in understanding how the human brain works and changes during life," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/new-research-confirms-that-neurons-form-in-the-adult-brain"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Jonas Frisén.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation that humans can form new neurons in the hippocampus through life (as several other animals can) would inform a whole host of other scientific investigations, from how adults &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/window-for-mastering-new-language-wider-than-we-thought"&gt;learn new skills&lt;/a&gt; to what happens to the brain as it deteriorates &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night-study-says"&gt;in old age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used RNA analysis to identify functions of brain cells in samples collected from people up to age 78, finding that some neurons were geared to function as neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which generate new nerve cells. The researchers also found similarities between human NPCs and those &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.10.036"&gt;in mice, pigs, and monkeys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166907" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans.jpg" alt="Neuron scan charts" class="wp-image-166907 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans-516x415.jpg 516w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans-600x482.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166907" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers compared neuron production between children, adults, and other animals.

That might point to differences in brain plasticity that affect learning, personality, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, but that's something that future studies will need to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is that certain brain conditions might be affected by how quickly fresh new neurons can be produced – some of the subjects in this study had a history of psychiatric or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;neurological diseases&lt;/a&gt; – but again this wasn't something that the researchers looked at directly, so follow-up studies will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research may also have implications for the development of regenerative treatments that stimulate neurogenesis in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/new-research-confirms-that-neurons-form-in-the-adult-brain"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frisén.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu9575"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

at the Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're spending much longer peeing, you're potentially holding in urine for too long, which can lead to your bladder expanding too much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average bladder holds between 400ml and 600ml, roughly one pint, and people typically need to pass urine four to eight times a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have warned that waiting until you're bursting before going to the loo puts you at a higher risk of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12226215/The-rules-never-thought-needed-know-WEEING.html"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study has suggested the healthy amount of time you should be spending on the loo urinating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the dangers of holding in your pee are no laughing matter for Chris Blick, a consultant urological surgeon at the Princess Grace Hospital in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He previously &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12226215/The-rules-never-thought-needed-know-WEEING.html"&gt;told MailOnline&lt;/a&gt;: 'Generally speaking you shouldn't force yourself to wait until you are desperate to urinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Occasionally, this technique may be used as part of bladder retraining to support patients with overactive bladders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Holding on too much can be painful and, if you have a urine infection, can make you feel unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you regularly hold in your urine, over time this can cause your bladder to stretch.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, on urinating too often, he said: 'This will potentially train your bladder to empty when it doesn't need to, and can create a habit leading to unwanted frequency of urination.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8450375/Mans-bladder-TORN-APART-holding-urine-18-hours-drank-10-bottles-beer.html"&gt;man's bladder&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man previously suffered a torn bladder after not urinating for 18 hours when he fell asleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was rushed to a local hospital, Zhuji People's Hospital of Zhejiang Province after suddenly suffering severe abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After conducting a CT scan on Mr Hu, the medics discovered that the man's bladder had been torn apart with three holes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the tears had even opened up towards his abdominal cavity and caused part of his intestines to enter the bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Hu was immediately scheduled to undergo an operation to fix his bladder following the doctors' shocking discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeons said that the man could be in a life-threatening condition if his bladder tears were not repaired in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also follows a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14816631/Top-NHS-GP-reveals-spending-long-toilet-doom-scrolling-disastrous-health.html"&gt;recent warning&lt;/a&gt; from an NHS GP that scrolling on your phone while on the toilet can trigger a host of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Punam Krishan, these include haemorrhoids, also known as piles, a weakened pelvic floor—triggering continence issues—and, in extreme cases, lead to a painful condition called rectal prolapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Haemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the back passage that can cause itching, discomfort, bleeding, and a persistent feeling of needing to pass stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though often dismissed as minor or embarrassing, haemorrhoids are extremely common—affecting an estimated one in three adults in the UK at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the increase in prolonged toilet sitting, often coupled with mobile phone use, is quietly contributing to a rise in cases, Dr Krishnan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have previously warned against '&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-5942053/Women-not-peegasms-Doctors-warn-cause-kidney-damage.html"&gt;peegasms&lt;/a&gt;' which became a bizarre new sex trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man published in a forum that his girlfriend told him releasing pent-up urine caused her to experience shivers 'from her spine to her head', MailOnline&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-5942053/Women-not-peegasms-Doctors-warn-cause-kidney-damage.html"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:49:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPaUVyd3FjWUQ3NU9wQnRiWWxTTks3TFdzMDBlYWdCRjRrQXJRV2lVTWQ0S0FrTDBhYXpDVUhHdXotZ3kwUGVSMDA5bjdXcnBIUWVLN3IwbW1kQ0o5TFNIa0hWLXRQQWI1X2d5WGV4NEtYaDFtbEhBZkVEZDQ2N2ZHQ3YyR2k4SHdwc3FPVVNucGlmU3JfX1ltdXg1dWVBeGVkUW9wMmt0VGhnRGxWWWfSAbMBQVVfeXFMTWRUTEpQTDNOVkE2dnhKVEVDNjhxdS1rWjk0Wl9kQW4wVUdNSDlQSm54ODdhUG1vekJ6LWpjc2pHM3dBaWt3RWlHRFJEN2loU1NTaWJITHVhcmFNUEVqOFBIb0s5Nk1kTTRaLVY0M3NRWVlncHFZZFBqU19NZmpFZC10TzZvYzFDUzlKUEtIZkQ0VGR5YmZwTWhlaWtOQ2JnbU5ZMERPMGNfMEdTZkNSbW9lbjg</guid></item><item><title>心脏病和BMI与绝经后妇女乳腺癌风险增加相关- Scimex | Heart disease and BMI linked with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women - Scimex</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNQWlWcmRwdnJRQUN6Uzc5amN1cHZhMzFncUtvVFBtMGk5M0loQzk2SS1CVkZhRzRicEIySm9tVkhCbFVLNHJ4WTU3M3p1dkJLbUtob1ZBX2RaOFVadk9RbjJiRjY5T0kxem9oQnd4eG44S19kZXBhMGxaY2YzbTFObVYxZjRkTmI1VE5PVHl6V1Q3Q00wVE90OG5UTE56ZDU3T2t4S1FETTdGN205eVowelB2WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story-summary"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="story-summary-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In postmenopausal women with heart disease, excess weight could be linked to an especially high risk of developing breast cancer, according to international researchers. The team looked at data from over 168,000 postmenopausal women who did not have type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease when they agreed to participate. After a follow-up of around 10 years, over 6,000 developed breast cancer, and the team found that in women who developed cardiovascular disease during the study, each 5 point increase in BMI was associated with a 31% higher risk of breast cancer when compared to women without cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does body mass index affect breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women with and without cardiovascular disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis shows that weight-associated breast cancer risk is higher in women with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research reveals that excess weight is linked to an especially high risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women with cardiovascular disease. The findings are published by &lt;a href="https://zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.wiley.com%2F/1/01000197cb39c7fe-8757bfab-e5e9-498d-a8c0-092e46891925-000000/ar_rreNj0Y8xYzsWyvyAKaqESzY=433"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;a href="https://zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Facsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fjournal%2F10970142%3Fdmmsmid=73865%26dmmspid=22624228%26dmmsuid=1961220/1/01000197cb39c7fe-8757bfab-e5e9-498d-a8c0-092e46891925-000000/dJyVq8jWm3Qmy5Q9R1Pd5vB3IZw=433"&gt;CANCER&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although higher body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it’s unclear whether this risk differs among women with and without cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. To investigate, a team led by Heinz Freisling, PhD, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization) analyzed data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and UK Biobank on 168,547 postmenopausal women who did not have, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease when they agreed to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 10.7 years in EPIC and 10.9 years in UK Biobank, 6,793 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer. In a pooled analysis of both studies, each 5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; increase in BMI was associated with a 31% higher risk of breast cancer in women who developed cardiovascular disease during follow-up and a 13% higher risk in women without cardiovascular disease. The development of type 2 diabetes did not seem to affect breast cancer risk: women with or without type 2 diabetes had a similarly elevated breast cancer risk related to higher BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and cardiovascular disease was estimated to lead to 153 more cases of breast cancer per 100,000 people per year than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings of this study could be used to inform risk-stratified breast cancer screening programs,” said Dr. Freisling. “This study should also inspire future research to include women with a history of cardiovascular diseases in weight loss trials for breast cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;

Severe muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, can increase the risk of illness and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WNR4OFYXRFBMVGKN7IDZN7XLEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although you can’t prevent all age-related muscle loss, you can slow it down significantly and even boost your strength level in the process. You’ve probably heard that exercise, especially weight training, can help you build and maintain muscle. What isn’t discussed as often is the role that diet plays in keeping your muscles in good shape. “You can’t get stronger without eating properly, so diet is essential,” says Elizabeth Klingbeil, an assistant professor in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4H4DJGMYNBH3TJOWSLUP2MO45Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Follow these eating tips to fuel muscle growth and feel stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3LFVGOBZ4JGZXLVNOIISFQVNHM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3LFVGOBZ4JGZXLVNOIISFQVNHM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Bump up your protein&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T57RJ4CAXJH4HDK6EDJEMNXNUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Protein is core to building muscle and, even more so, maintaining it, Klingbeil says. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that adults eat 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. But an &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1174-1" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 42 percent of men and 50 percent of women over age 70 don’t get that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBDPN3YSSJAXLD2WTHH6OSUXA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some experts recommend even more protein for older adults to compensate for muscle loss and the fact that building new muscle becomes harder with age, Klingbeil says. Aim for 0.45 to 0.59 grams per pound per day — that’s 72 to 94 grams for a 160-pound person. (But if you have kidney disease, check with your doctor about your protein intake because too much can tax your kidneys.) Dietitians generally recommend spreading protein throughout the day because that may help your body absorb it better, but Klingbeil says that getting enough is the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YDDEDAEALRBLDEND2P6Q6IUGTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The source of protein isn’t super important for building muscle, says Travis Masterson, the principal investigator of the Health, Ingestive Behavior, and Technology Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/how-red-meat-can-fit-into-a-healthy-diet-a3360518260/" target="_blank"&gt;Animal foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to have more per serving than plant sources. But for other aspects of your health, it’s best to get at least some of your protein from plants, such as beans, nuts and tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IRDQYIYNQRADVN33ET622RPCSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A plant-based diet that includes mostly whole foods is good for your heart and brain, and it lowers your risk of certain cancers. “It also appears to be gentler on the kidneys than a diet high in animal protein as we age,” says Judy Lester, a clinical dietitian at the University of North Carolina Health Care System in Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GH2FAXJWWBAZRD7IUXPWZ2N2JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are 20 grams of protein in a cup of tofu; about 18 grams in a cup of lentils, white beans or edamame; 8 grams in a cup of quinoa or whole-wheat pasta; and 7 grams in an ounce of peanuts. Beef and chicken breast have about 24 grams in 3 ounces. A 5.5-ounce serving of plain nonfat &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/yogurt/healthy-yogurts-that-taste-great-too-a1114386696/" target="_blank"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; has 16 grams, a cup of low-fat milk has about 8 grams, and an egg has 6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZK4XCWDUMFAJ3ITFWG4HWXFO3Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZK4XCWDUMFAJ3ITFWG4HWXFO3Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Get enough calories&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSOR7IS6WZDDDOGXPMEKFMTYPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’re not getting enough calories, your body will break down muscle,” Klingbeil says. Calorie needs vary based on height, weight, gender and activity levels, but eating somewhere between 1,800 to 2,400 calories per day is probably adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TWVS7NA4JNGBXOYJQIGUBT24JE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TWVS7NA4JNGBXOYJQIGUBT24JE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Choose quality carbs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4HLP2AP2TNAFNKCC5MXNOHELNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Carbohydrates fuel your muscles, so they can help you feel stronger. The best sources are whole grains, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/canned-foods/best-tasting-canned-beans-a6489833691/" target="_blank"&gt;legumes&lt;/a&gt;, fruits and vegetables. Refined carbs like white bread, crackers, soda and desserts can boost short-term energy, but unlike high-quality carbs, they don’t have the advantage of being rich in fiber and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N6ONHD5KMVEHBAJ6XW6J6I33BQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research shows that fiber may help build or preserve muscle mass, possibly because it increases the level of healthy bacteria in the gut that produce short-chain fatty acids.

Still, we know that the vitamin is important for bone, muscle and overall health, Klingbeil says, so getting the recommended 20 micrograms (800 IU) per day is smart. New guidelines from the Endocrine Society don’t recommend regular vitamin D testing for healthy adults, so ask your doctor what’s right for you given your particular health picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KRXJGKPPORF3LMBN4RULB7XRXE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KRXJGKPPORF3LMBN4RULB7XRXE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Add omega-3s&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKKYM6XZBJHNRFONVSUNDH5PLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These fats, found in fish, may help protect from normal age-related declines in muscle. In a 2020 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7071242/" target="_blank"&gt;review of research on sarcopenia published in the journal Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, researchers noted that eating fatty fish was linked to increases in muscle mass and better performance on muscle-strength tests. Other studies have shown similar benefits for people who took omega-3 supplements, but the science isn’t conclusive. For now, aim to eat two servings of fatty fish like salmon or sardines per week, which is the American Heart Association’s recommendation for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3OMT3BM3TREURCJBIUXZG7Y4DE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3OMT3BM3TREURCJBIUXZG7Y4DE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Stay hydrated&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWSQBKKSIZGC7FGU5ZXELUELOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Getting plenty of fluids is important for overall health and preserving muscle, Lester says. Muscle is 70 to 75 percent water, and insufficient water content inside muscle cells has been linked to changes in muscle strength and the ability to do daily activities, as well as a higher risk of frailty in older adults. Drinking water is obviously helpful, but you can also get fluids from other healthy beverages (coffee, tea and milk, for instance) and eating fruits, vegetables and soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="27RN3PBZ6ZHQXEEXMNXSKMZB7I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="27RN3PBZ6ZHQXEEXMNXSKMZB7I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Ask your doctor about creatine&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZGWRCV2EIRAR3EQS6T5VAC7NGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This compound in muscle tissue is found in meat and seafood, and your body also makes it. But taking it in pill or powder form may be helpful for some people. “Creatine in the muscle is used for producing energy, especially in that initial onset of a contraction, the first one to two seconds,” Masterson says. “The more creatine you can get into the muscle, the more effective that first bit of contraction is going to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VQTOXJB2GBHX5KYLJJ4B2OO6CE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Creatine is often used by athletes looking to improve exercise performance, but some research suggests that older adults may benefit from it, too. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/" target="_blank"&gt;review published in 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that creatine — in combination with regular &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dumbbells/strength-training-using-adjustable-dumbbells-a3150717795/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; — may help reduce the risk of sarcopenia and falls. (Muscle is important for balance, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XEJOXQIGZZGEVKU4PSOFP4NWDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m pretty anti-supplement overall,” Masterson says. “But creatine is one where there are no known side effects, and it’s pretty cheap. Will it drastically change someone? No, but it could give you more energy for exercise or even provide more oomph as you’re trying to get out of a chair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IE7DIX3Y5JHS7GHE2JWWDYXWM4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IE7DIX3Y5JHS7GHE2JWWDYXWM4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The importance of strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UIXS4T3OTJG6TG26T7KBGMDTCY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s no getting around the fact that exercise is crucial for your muscles. But that doesn’t mean you have to take up bodybuilding to get stronger in your 60s, 70s and beyond. Activities like walking and simple &lt;a href="http://cr.org/4strength" target="_blank"&gt;strength-training&lt;/a&gt; moves such as chair squats (repeatedly sitting and standing) and wall push-ups — and just being active and moving more in general — are a good way to preserve muscle and keep bones and joints strong, Masterson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KVHCJMREWFCDJEQKMKIJQX6PQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want to go further, you can find weight-focused classes that use dumbbells or other simple equipment at gyms or community recreation centers, or online. (Check out the &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/@nihaging" target="_blank"&gt;workout videos from the National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;.) Try to time your workouts so you’ll be having a meal or snack within a few hours afterward, Masterson says. Both exercise and eating protein stimulate muscle development, so combining them will lead to greater effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.
