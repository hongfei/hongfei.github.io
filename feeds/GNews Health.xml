Food anaphylaxis admissions to UK hospitals increased threefold from 1998 to 2018, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597169/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to one analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of people affected by less severe allergies has also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00163-4/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;risen significantly&lt;/a&gt;, with factors including weaning practices, detergents and lack of childhood contact with dirt and animals all potential drivers of the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exposure as treatment is not a new idea: the first successful use of oral immunotherapy for a 13-year-old boy with egg allergy was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11250212/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported in The Lancet in 1908&lt;/a&gt;. But in the past decade, scientists have developed the incremental dosing protocols required to move this concept into the clinic. The licensing of the drug Palforzia – pharmaceutical-grade peanut protein – means the treatment can now be delivered to those whose allergies are extreme enough that a few milligrams too much peanut protein could trigger anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The treatment regimes are intensive, requiring fortnightly dosage escalations and a level of clinical supervision that has resulted in paediatric NHS waiting lists of several years. And, for most, they are not a cure – patients have an increased tolerance to low doses, but need to maintain daily exposure and are still considered allergic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The issue with eating a peanut every day is that you’re on a bit of a tightrope,” says Prof Graham Roberts, an allergy specialist at the University of Southampton. “You might still have a life-threatening allergic reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is also a growing cohort of patients managing multiple allergies, for whom the approach is impractical. “That’s where the advantage of treatments that are completely agnostic to the food you’re allergic to comes in,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Food allergies normally involve a class of potent antibodies, called IgEs, that bind to immune cells 1,000 times more tightly than other classes of antibody and which scientists think originally evolved to protect the body from parasites. Now, largely redundant in modern lifestyles, they have a weakness for misfiring in response to food proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;landmark study last year&lt;/a&gt;, Wood and his colleagues found that the anti-IgE drug omalizumab, already licensed for severe asthma, could desensitise people to peanut, cashew, milk, egg, walnut, wheat and hazelnut allergies (participants were allergic to at least three) by mopping up the antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The treatment is “not without some burden”, Wood acknowledges, requiring ongoing fortnightly injections of a drug with an annual list price of between &lt;a href="https://www.xolair.com/cost.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$30,000 and $60,000&lt;/a&gt;. But it can be life-changing for those who need to avoid pervasive products such as milk, eggs and wheat. “Those families don’t travel without a cooler full of food,” Wood says. “They can’t eat out. They can’t trust anyone to prepare anything for their child. Your day-to-day life is massively compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New products in the pipeline could further lower the bar for treatment, including a &lt;a href="https://brandonbiocatalyst.com/2024/10/28/aravax-completes-recruitment-into-phase-2-study-of-pvx108-a-novel-immunotherapy-for-the-treatment-of-peanut-allergy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peanut allergy vaccine candidate&lt;/a&gt; being developed by the Australian biotech firm Aravax (the phase 2 trial still involved monthly injections) and a &lt;a href="https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/peanut-allergy-patch-shows-promising-long-term-results-in-3-year-study/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peanut patch&lt;/a&gt; developed by the French company DBV that recently showed promising results in a three-year trial. Both promise a less gruelling and safer treatment regime, with lower chances of severe reactions during dose escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While immunotherapy does not reverse most food allergies, for bee stings it has a higher than 90% cure rate. Prof Markus Ollert, of the Luxembourg Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, tracked patients treated for bee sting allergies and revealed that a molecule called interleukin-6 appears to act as a switch in the transition from being allergic to tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Others are focused on trying to prevent allergies arising in the first place. A primary culprit for the rise in allergies appears to have been misguided medical advice in the 1990s that parents should avoid giving babies foods such as peanuts in the first year of life. “Since then we’ve seen an absolute explosion in allergies,” says Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a randomised trial, he and colleagues found that introducing peanuts into the diet at four months led to an 80% reduction in allergies. Another, more recent study, found large reductions in peanut, egg, wheat and cows’ milk allergies when introduced to babies from three months of age. However, despite iron-clad evidence that early introduction is protective, it has proved difficult to undo warnings around the dangers of introducing peanuts too early and change parents’ behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQVG1Vbkg2WTRSXzJxVzRSZFVCRWZhbEY0U05KN2JQRWh1V1E0dThrSEoyNGFDS2ZPX1FGV0d0YUJ6Z3BhTm9yeHFyeF9jN2tYa1p1cHJSQWV1ZzhmQUxjeXY0Q2kxTU9XR1llRllWVnlXdk9sSkZwV3Y2Rlp1bGtVRTNlcVppUF95ZUdzeHltN0tXUTVMYnNEY3ZoTVFqc19EYnJvakFmR0hxeG95dGNRSQ</guid></item><item><title>救命！我在停车场遇到了“可怕的事情”。“我必须直截了当地创造纪录。-石板 | Help!

They have the type of twin closeness I thought only existed in fiction—lots of time together, shared interests, communicating so much with only eye contact, and living in opposite halves of a duplex together. Adam is straight but his brother, “Kyle,” is gay. Because they’re so close, I also spend enormous amounts of time with Kyle and his boyfriend, “Nick.” I’m lucky that I really enjoy Kyle and Nick because it is a lot like I acquired another sibling and a close friend, as soon as I got serious with my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

She asked me point blank in person once, and when I denied it she left an accusing note on my car! I mentioned this as a weird experience to a friend, and she told me that there is absolutely gossip going around town about one or both of us being unfaithful because of the optics of the time spent together. I’m 32, we’re not in high school! Both Nick and I moved to this medium-sized commuter town about a year ago and met our boyfriends at that point, so we don’t know a lot of people here. I’m kind of at a loss about what to do. Do I just ignore it? My boyfriend advocates for this, but it feels weird. Go places as a group of four and hope it fades? I feel like I’m living out a bad sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree with your boyfriend that your best bet is to ignore what your friend told you about the rumors, and when it comes to in-person confrontations like the one you had with your neighbor, you can just say “you’re welcome.” If she asks what you’re talking about you can say “The story you made up about me is obviously captivating to you, and you didn’t even have to subscribe to a streaming service and watch reality TV to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;

She recently took on a great deal of extra work and stress when my sister suffered a stroke that left her severely physically disabled. As my sister, a successful physician before her stroke, has spent more time with my mom, she has become increasingly worried about my mom’s memory. Alzheimer’s sadly runs in our family and is something that my mother fears deeply. My sister wants me to speak to our mom about this, but I worry about adding to her stress/fear at an already unbearably hard time in her life. My sister struggles with speech, so it would be hard for her to have this conversation herself. Would it be appropriate to bring this up to my mom’s PCP (a close family friend, in addition to an excellent doctor)? I wonder if it would be easier on my mom if her PCP brought this up at her next appointment as something more routine, instead of something we have noticed lately. I guess, in general: When is it time for kids to start taking a more active role in parents’ health, and is it ever ok for us to speak directly to their healthcare professionals?&lt;/p&gt;

I really think our culture needs something similar to mark older adults’ transition into the stage of life in which other people will begin to handle stuff for them—a big party that celebrates the life they’ve lived so far and comes with an understanding that the moment has come for loved ones to take a bigger role in supporting them, helping with daily life, and managing healthcare decisions. Similar to how a bride and groom sign a marriage certificate at the reception, the guest of honor could sit at a nicely decorated table to finalize their power of attorney and healthcare proxy paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9x9v51200333575ognipz4n@published"&gt;In the absence of one clear moment in which responsibility shifts, the question you asked, “When is it time for kids to start taking an active role in parents’ health?” is always a really touchy and fraught one. No one wants to offend an older adult by treating them as if they’re incompetent! But also, no one wants a loved one to suffer because they are in fact less up to the task of managing their own health than they once were. And it all happens under a cloud of anxiety about death, so conversations about this are even harder to think about and tempting to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

I assume she’s spoken openly about her fears about memory issues. One approach could be to say, “Mom, I know you’ve always been worried about Alzheimer’s because of what [x relative] went through. There are some good medications these days, so let’s talk to your doctor about whether some of the forgetfulness you’ve been dealing with is just normal aging, or whether it’s something we can start treating as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve seen some very honest and beautiful obituaries that are explicit about the fact that the deceased person died by suicide, and include language about depression and mental health. If you’re not comfortable with that, “died suddenly” or “died unexpectedly” would work. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She told us that her husband of 30 years is a narcissist and has been cheating on her since day one of her marriage. We have known for years that he is an alcoholic, and he is a lovable guy that my husband gets along well with. She tells us he sleeps with other women and other men, and that he tracks her car, her messages, everything. She says he’s taken out multiple mortgages on the house without her knowledge and all the finances are kept secret. She has no evidence to back any of this up and all she wants is to be believed and be heard. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/friend-terrible-marriage-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;Against my better judgment, I’m asked to believe her. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In her early career, Golden was often inspired by the way her clients tackled new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DLQ6S5XYQBHTHJ6BDTJBSE5C6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I found it very enriching,” she said, to see that “they can change, and they can grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMPRDMG4VBFVXM4M73V57SCUSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As she has gotten older, she has tried to embrace that openness to new experiences. But she didn’t realize how hard it could be for an older person. Last year, for example, she took up pickleball. She wasn’t expecting to play professionally, but she assumed she would improve alongside the younger students in the class she joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWYCVHRJ25EXBPTPN5VIM6GV6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When she didn’t, she started to think about quitting. “I’m in this class and all these people are progressing and I’m not,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EAFY44OW5VDW3G5RORLWH4AJNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A conversation with a friend changed her mind. “I realized, they’re all thirty-some years younger,” she said. “I hadn’t even thought of that.” Golden, now associate vice president of social work and community health at Chicago’s Rush University, stuck out the class, and she still plays every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="URFN4J43UFDNPK57X2P7MPMG64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That is an experience echoed by other social workers, professors and researchers who study aging in America. Many have spent decades working with seniors, but they found that getting older themselves shifted their thinking and what they tell their clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HUGGEVQUBA4BJN2C4M46AFP3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some are surprised by how much fun they are having. Others have had to adjust their expectations of themselves and their bodies. And all acknowledge that some of the biggest obstacles facing seniors include the rising cost of health care, the dearth of affordable housing, and the astronomical fees for nursing homes or assisted living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AQDWQOYFURAVPGLOGNP5WGCXFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We spoke with more than a dozen experts to gather their thoughts on aging, and what they would tell their younger selves.

The psychologist earned her PhD in her 50s and retired just three years ago in Concord, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IW6BLW27RGUPPGB3PY6TG5Y2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even so, she feared slowing down. “We’re sold a bill of goods about loss and decline” as an expected part of aging, Esty said. “I started to believe it myself.” To combat her dread, Esty interviewed 120 octogenarians about their lives. What brought them joy, even as they lost partners and suffered physical setbacks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XDSKQAMCVDWHKYKQPLZLTDN5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her conclusion: People with a project or a passion they were pursuing were in much better mental and physical shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SYA3HRAFXFDPPHWX5XTWBN23CM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They were climbing huge mountains, doing things they’d never done before,” she said. One book-loving friend had always wanted to try teaching. After retirement, he worked up the courage to lead English classes at an institute for retirement learning. He’s still at it years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GWUNDFQJHZCLPBDCLR3QFKA3KY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research has shown that learning cognitively demanding skills as we age, such as quilting or digital photography, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4154531/" target="_blank"&gt;can improve memory, brain health and well-being.&lt;/a&gt; Older adults engaged in activities they enjoy live longer, happier lives and develop fewer diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/participating-activities-you-enjoy-you-age" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Institutes for Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5HXITI2A2ND7FJK7ZQXMR7F6KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Esty’s conversations — which eventually became the book “Eightysomethings: A Practical Guide to Letting Go, Aging Well, and Finding Unexpected Happiness” — made her realize that she needed to rethink her assumptions about her own old age. Though she had pictured a restful retirement, she realized she would be happier pursuing creative projects and speaking engagements — and it would probably be better for her mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PRPOPVTROFFZFDCHO3WFG5BYHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I enjoyed work and had lots of energy,” she said. “It completely revolutionized what I expected in my old age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CZY3NPAXA5B2ZFK7HZWBIK2VFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Leanna Clark-Shirley, 44, president and CEO of the American Society on Aging, said she hears often from older adults who say they have shed their inhibitions as they have aged, diving into a new hobby or business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GRHTIUGT6FFDTAZMOAS3CE5CAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“In every conversation I have with someone in their seventies or eighties, the fear or hesitancy has gone away,” she said. “Rather than viewing aging as a time where you lose things, [they see] aging as something that can happen concurrently with new interests and new adventures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="75Z4FQ5DIVAKTGTGVZV7VZUF5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on adaptability, not just resilience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UI3XTH34SRHTBGSYNT5XLAZK5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Bruce Leff, 63, has built his medical career around treating — and studying — aging. So it’s not surprising that he gets asked one question over and over: What’s the best way to grow old?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UGPM75AAP5HUXNG6GS4SLFW2BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When he was younger, the Baltimore-based doctor had a set of standard health recommendations for older people: exercise and eat well, though no need to avoid the occasional glass of wine or dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CM6YIQYMDNG2FMWCJUOUFBL6JU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But as he has eased into senior citizenship, Leff saw greater nuance. “As you get older, you understand different aspects of life,” Leff said. “You’ve had your own experiences, you’re more empathetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZSM77XV7FGVVC4RYSBIUPE5TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Resilience, Leff said, is a popular term among doctors, who urge their patients to stay tough through discomfort or unpleasantness until things return to normal. Now he’s come to see adaptation — adjusting and accepting what life throws your way — as equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U5K4CYPIUFED3ONYOWJL2HQSBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of his patients are struggling with life-changing events, such as the death of a spouse, a cancer diagnosis or even retirement. Though many go through a period of “feeling a bit lost,” he said, “the vast, vast, vast majority of people find their way to seeking happiness and purpose and meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJYZTUSHRVCFHODB6X3MOOIW44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ellen Langer, a 78-year-old Harvard University psychology professor, who studies the connection between mind and body, says that viewing aging positively — and focusing on what you are able to do, not what you can’t — can improve your health and mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTU4U6ALBFCRXD4ZWFMJ44MCYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Much of the research she does has focused on how to stay happy through old age. In one &lt;a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2010/08/the-mindfulness-chronicles" target="_blank"&gt;well-known experiment, &lt;/a&gt;eight septuagenarians were briefly moved into a facility that had been meticulously styled to resemble the world as the subjects knew it 20 years ago. They were all encouraged to live as if they were their younger selves. After the experiment ended, Langer found that many of the subjects had improved vision and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JS555UJAWZFE5LJ6FLKDOQUQP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As Langer has gotten older, she hasn’t suffered the same discontents as many of her peers because she said she avoids the negative thinking about aging that traps other people. “I don’t walk around experiencing my age,” she said. “Age is not a relevant dimension to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL4ELG4BXNDYFM6QV27756QIOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t get discouraged — and don’t be too hard on yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2Y6HCOTWBGZDMBBUQXXYVOCBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Michael Schuchert, a 54-year-old personal trainer who primarily works with older clients at DeHenzel Training Systems in northern Virginia and D.C., always knew the importance of being fit, but he only became interested in training after a running injury pushed him into physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5RM6PPDRKBCU5EKBGBEVK56C5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Schuchert realized that he needed to adjust his routine to his changing body. His clients, who range in age from their 40s to 80s, do as well. Some are interested in building upper-body strength so that they can pick up their grandchildren. Another wanted to improve her balance after a bicycle accident caused some neurological issues. One recent milestone: She was able to put on her pants while balancing on one leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGGZQFFIF5AMBKYG7CYXVCGDFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“As I’ve aged, I’ve started to feel more aches and pains,” Schuchert said. He finds his body is a little more delicate now, and it takes longer to recovery from injuries. “I need that core [muscle] … because I still have 25, 30-plus years ahead of me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2ODEUZZ6C5EXXN5O3QXUZ7HJCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Golden said that as a younger social worker, she didn’t always see the appeal of shared senior living, with its exercise classes and group activities.

Here’s what causes ghost poops — and what they say about your overall health:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes a bowel movement a ‘ghost poop’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you take a look at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pediatricsurgery.stanford.edu/Conditions/BowelManagement/bristol-stool-form-scale.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bristol Stool Scale" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pediatricsurgery.stanford.edu/Conditions/BowelManagement/bristol-stool-form-scale.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bristol Stool Scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a visual chart that classifies bowel movements, ghost poops qualify as a Type 4 poo, Barten said. Though there may be no evidence left in the pot, your poop might look like a piece of sausage that’s smooth and soft. “I would consider that to be an absolutely perfect poop,” Barten said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ira-leeds/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ira Leeds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ira-leeds/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ira Leeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Yale Medicine colorectal surgeon, said ghost poops — or nirvana poops, as he calls them — easily (but noticeably) pass through the anal canal, sink to the bottom of the toilet, and leave no residue when wiping. These three factors are indicative of good bowel health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bowel movement that easily moves through the anal canal typically has an ideal consistency, according to Leeds. As such, you don’t have to push as hard. This, in turn, minimizes straining and toilet time, which can both lead to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures, he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Floating poops typically have a higher fat content, which causes them to stay on the surface of the water. But when your poop sinks? This suggests your digestion is functioning well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are being broken down properly into their constitutive parts that can be used by the body effectively,” Leeds said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, seeing a lot of residue on the toilet paper when wiping could mean you have an underlying health issue. According to Leeds, if you have to wipe at least three times, you may want to investigate. While your diet may be to blame (more on that below), excess wiping can occur if you have hemorrhoids, fissures, chronic itching, or an anal fistulae, Leeds noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to ensure you have ghost poops?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are multiple factors that can impact the consistency of your poop such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622001924?via=ihub#s0085" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622001924?via=ihub#s0085" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4202343/#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20clinical%20and%20experimental,nervous%20system,%20peripheral%20neurons%20and" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="stress" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4202343/#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20clinical%20and%20experimental,nervous%20system,%20peripheral%20neurons%20and" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; levels along with how much you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399653/#:~:text=After%20covariates%20adjustment,%20men%20with,CI:1.10%E2%80%932.29)." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="sleep" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399653/#:~:text=After%20covariates%20adjustment,%20men%20with,CI:1.10%E2%80%932.29)." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and exercise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to improve your gut health, Barten recommended starting with dietary changes. In general, a high-fiber diet will bulk up your stool so that it looks like the Type 4 poo on that Bristol Stool Scale. Aim to consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-22_More_About_Carbs.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-22_More_About_Carbs.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The more fiber you eat, the better your stool consistency will be, the easier it’ll be to go to the bathroom, and the less toilet paper you’ll need, Leeds said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people have food sensitivities and intolerances. So, it’s worth being aware of how you react to various foods and drinks. The reason: “Avoiding foods that irritate your gut is important for having well-formed stools,” Barten said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5357536/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Evidence" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5357536/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also shows that exercise can improve your bowel movements. “Regular cardiovascular exercise improves nervous system regulation and movement literally helps things move better — our joints, our muscles and our bowels,” Barten said.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following this no-sugar meal plan for a week made a huge difference in my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I experienced more energy, fewer sugar cravings and thought less about food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed the recipes so much that some have made it into my weekly rotation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A few weeks ago, I decided to embark on a challenge: Following an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt; meal plan for a week. I’m not much of a meal planner or prepper, but I aspire to be, and I liked the idea of following a curated menu. And I can honestly say I was surprised at some of the changes I experienced as far as my cravings and relationship with food in just that one week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-your-diet-ease-seasonal-allergies-11709305" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spring allergies&lt;/a&gt;, various food sensitivities and affinity for added sugar, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8612457" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;7-Day No-Sugar, Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt; seemed like just the thing. Over the course of a week, my husband and I tried new recipes and filled our fridge and bodies with healthy foods. The recipes were delicious and the portions were generous. Here are the biggest things that happened when I followed an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-experienced-sugar-withdrawalthen-stopped-craving-it-entirely"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Experienced Sugar Withdrawal…Then Stopped Craving It Entirely &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who knows me knows that I have a sweet tooth, and a pretty big one at that. I look forward to having a bite of something sweet after a meal, and not just after dinner. Decreasing my added sugar intake has been a personal goal for a long time, but as an emotional eater who keeps sugary foods stocked in their house, I hadn’t made any real progress until my week following the meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; True to its name, the no-sugar, anti-inflammatory meal plan does not include foods containing added sugars. The only sugars I consumed that week were naturally occurring; found in fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy. Instead of chocolate bars and cookies, I ate blueberries and kefir, beets, pears and sliced oranges. It was definitely a huge shift for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I noticed the change to my diet almost immediately, with some pretty intense headaches and brain fog on the first two days. Despite these challenges, I didn’t deviate from the meal plan. I continued to prepare and enjoy all the meals and snacks, but definitely felt a bit out of it at first. It wasn’t a fun feeling, but by day three of following the plan, I felt much better. And even more surprisingly, I find myself wanting a sugary bite after every meal less often now. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy my sugar-sweetened desserts. But now I do it more mindfully, paying attention to the texture and flavor, and savoring every bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-had-more-energy-despite-spending-more-time-preparing-food"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Had More Energy, Despite Spending More Time Preparing Food &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I won’t sugarcoat it (ha!) The recipes in this meal plan are pretty involved, with some having lengthy ingredient lists and several steps to prepare. But since I like cooking, work from home and had help from my husband with preparing the meals, it was manageable. In fact, some of the recipes that I initially balked at due to their long ingredient lists have made it into my regular rotation of meals, snacks and sides. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are these recipes delicious, but they’re also packed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; like dark leafy greens, legumes and nuts. Foods like spinach, kale, chickpeas and nuts deliver nutrients that helped me feel my best during that week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite spending more time shopping for ingredients, cooking and washing dishes, I found that I had more energy during the week I followed the meal plan. I felt more rested when it was time to get up in the morning, and didn’t fall asleep on the couch after dinner—a common ritual that I had normalized. This seems a little obvious, especially now that I reflect on it, but I’m still amazed at how much of a difference a week made and how much better I felt with some tweaks to my diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-thought-about-food-less"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Thought About Food Less &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I’m the type of person who thinks about their next meal while they’re currently eating one. I love food, write about food and edit food articles for a living, so it’s on my mind a lot. But that wasn’t the case during the week I followed the meal plan. Not only was I more satisfied after meals, but I didn’t have any cravings or feel the need to mindlessly snack. And though it was a busy and moderately stressful week for me, I wasn’t inclined to unwind with a glass of wine or a sweet bite. My relationship with food is complicated, and I’m still working on it, but I definitely felt a lot less anxiety about food and eating while following the meal plan. And with a meal and snack plan in place and my fridge and pantry stocked with all the necessary ingredients, it was a lot easier to adhere to a specific eating pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to be dramatic, but this meal plan changed my life. Though I didn’t make every single recipe, filling my fridge with fresh fruits and vegetables and taking a break from added sugar made a difference in so many aspects of my life in just one short week. I’m less interested in foods packed with added sugar, have more energy and overall less obsessive about food. It’s been a few weeks since I followed this meal plan, yet recipes like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250486/chickpea-potato-hash/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chickpea &amp;amp; Potato Hash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277838/feta-kale-pear-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Feta, Kale &amp;amp; Pear Salad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258084/peanut-butter-oat-energy-balls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Peanut Butter-Oat Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt; have made it into my weekly rotation.

The NHS states that eating a balanced diet and avoiding caffeine, spicy food, stress, dehydration, and lack of sleep can help with symptoms of atrial fibrillation. However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16765-atrial-fibrillation-afib" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;medication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the main form of treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla told Business Insider how he's changed his diet to improve his health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His aim was to up his consumption of plant-based foods, with lots of greens, and keeping protein and fiber in mind, which meant eating lots more whole foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla's diet has been almost entirely free from ultra-processed foods for 15 years, he said. However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-wrote-book-ultra-processed-foods-eats-in-a-day-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;dietitians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have previously told BI that the average person doesn't need to worry about the occasional ultra-processed food in their diet if they're eating mostly whole foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's been apparent to me that the overuse of additives, emulsifiers, and the habituation of this kind of food in our diet are responsible for a huge swath of ill health, and it goes beyond obesity," Aujla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is the most important thing because it affects your gut, which affects inflammation. There is a very clear link between the ultra-processed diet that is so normalized and a number of different conditions that we see affecting people across the UK and beyond."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla describes his diet as "plant-focused" or "plant-forward," meaning 70-75% plant-based while including some fish (about 20% of his diet), meat, and dairy products. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-friendly-high-protein-fiber-foods-doctor-stocks-kitchen-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staple foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Aujla's kitchen include nuts, seeds, tofu, and lentils.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla still eats foods that he enjoys, like pizza, but it'll be a high-quality pizza from a pizzeria rather than a fast-food chain. He'll pair it with a homemade broccoli salad with balsamic vinegar, rocket, and Parmesan shavings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I get greens in at every single meal," Aujla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a vexing question that is at the heart of why so many people find it so difficult to stick to a diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To get answers, one neuroscientist, Harvey J. Grill of the University of Pennsylvania, turned to rats and asked what would happen if he removed all of their brains except their brainstems. The brainstem controls basic functions like heart rate and breathing. But the animals could not smell, could not see, could not remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Would they know when they had consumed enough calories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To find out, Dr. Grill dripped liquid food into their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“When they reached a stopping point, they allowed the food to drain out of their mouths,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Those studies, initiated decades ago, were a starting point for a body of research that has continually surprised scientists and driven home that how full animals feel has nothing to do with consciousness. The work has gained more relevance as scientists puzzle out how exactly the new drugs that cause weight loss, commonly called &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/health/weight-loss-drugs-obesity-ozempic-wegovy.html" title=""&gt;GLP-1s and including Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, affect the brain’s eating-control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The story that is emerging does not explain why some people get obese and others do not. Instead, it offers clues about what makes us start eating, and when we stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While most of the studies were in rodents, it defies belief to think that humans are somehow different, said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University in New York. Humans, he said, are subject to billions of years of evolution leading to elaborate neural pathways that control when to eat and when to stop eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1k01t63/comment/mnaoaas/" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;: The conversations about vaccines rarely come up. I have tried to talk to them about it once in regard to my younger siblings. However, they are pretty resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the COVID-19 vaccine was rolling out, I tried to have a serious conversation with them about it, but it ended up in a big fight, which is not worth it to me. I think it's important to meet people where they're at and support them on their journey without being forceful because that can lead to more resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

County Department of Public Health so far this year. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prid=4982&amp;amp;keywords=measles&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;March,&lt;/a&gt; a county resident who had recently traveled through Los Angeles International Airport on a China Airlines flight from Taipei, Taiwan, tested positive. And &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prid=4971&amp;amp;keywords=measles&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, a case was reported in a non-L.A. County resident who arrived on a Korean Air flight from Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The traveler was not infectious during the time of travel,” the county Department of Public Health said in a statement Friday regarding the most recent case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are working to identify people who may have been exposed while the infected person was contagious with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a high fever — above 101 degrees — cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes and a rash, which usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads easily through the air and can remain airborne and on surfaces for hours, even after an infectious person has left the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can spread measles to others from four days before the disease’s telltale rash appears through four days afterward, according to the CDC. People who have not been immunized against measles, either through vaccination or prior infection, are at risk of getting sick between seven and 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles vaccine are 97% effective against infection, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials have identified 10 measles outbreaks nationwide. The largest began in a close-knit community with low vaccination rates in Texas’ Gaines County, adjacent to New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That outbreak has since spread to New Mexico and Oklahoma, and is suspected to be linked to more cases in Kansas, the CDC report said. A growing outbreak in the Mexican state of Chihuahua was also reported after a resident fell ill after visiting Gaines County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 884 measles cases have been reported nationwide, “the second-highest annual case count in 25 years,” according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During all of 2024, 285 measles cases were reported nationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the cases reported so far this year, the median patient age was 8. About one-third of those infected were younger than 5, the report said. Among all measles patients, 96% were not vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, 85 measles patients this year have had to be hospitalized. Except for one, all of them were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Texas officials have said the cause of the state’s latest measles death was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;measles pulmonary failure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the measles cases reported so far nationally this year are tied to close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Friday’s announcement, nine measles cases had been reported in California this year, with cases also reported in Orange, Riverside, Fresno, San Mateo, Placer and Tuolumne counties, according to the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, California confirmed 15 cases of measles. In 2023, the total was only four. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-disneyland-measles-20150114-story.html"&gt;worst measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;in recent memory occurred between December 2014 and April 2015. Centered at Disneyland, the outbreak resulted in about 131 Californians getting infected. People from six other states, Mexico and Canada were also sickened, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that outbreak, California lawmakers &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-measles-us-california-outbreak-vaccine-new-york-disneyland/" target="_blank"&gt;strengthened childhood vaccination&lt;/a&gt; requirements for schoolchildren. For the 2023-24 academic year, 96.2% of California’s kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s slightly down from the 96.5% seen the year prior. But it remains above the levels recorded before the Disneyland measles outbreak, which were less than 94%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say they aim for a 95% measles vaccination rate to guard against outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the ongoing outbreaks, pediatricians have stepped up efforts to rebut misinformation about both the disease and the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The measles vaccine is safe and effective,” the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, rebutting what they called “wellness influencers and anti-vaccine advocates” who they say “falsely assert” that getting vaccinated “is as dangerous as contracting measles itself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Extensive research demonstrates that the MMR vaccine is safe and significantly reduces the risk of contracting measles, a disease that can lead to severe complications and death,” the pediatrics group said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 01:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNM0VvTGZYR1JzZ3QxbExHTkU1NE9wTTZxYVByeFNwSkg3Z0E4amJBUWFBdW1JNXBJdmVsSklIMVZmN3JuSnZabmFkaXpjWk5sMEVVYjdqcG9WSlpZZDdzQmdJNEY0aHd5RGtPdjRXaG1jbndMbW1DRE50dXVPWFNRT2kyOEN6U1NxTlFod0JOMnpqR0ViNTJtc2YzWUNhYjhpM2NONXYwSnN6TXJfOXBQZGZkcU9TOVNhMmdCY0RVcXBFQlk</guid></item><item><title>诉讼指控马里兰州糖尿病患者在服用Ozempic后失明- NBC新闻 | Lawsuit alleges Maryland man with diabetes became blind after taking Ozempic - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTG1hd05HdElPM21xUkc1OXlHaGxNUXRFV3A0U2YteHY1LU9qVnFkOE1IbzFQWW0ydFBRSVFVUGY0and6TUh5c0E3M0FSSXR6LXlGX2JCbWplbTB0VWpzN0ZrOXAwYmxCRzNQVktUc05ER0JXR2RLb1AyMndZNDEwWElmdDNOd3FjaUQxRzZTbUE3VWJLb1E5eHE5OGc4RmlLakd3VFNJUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Maryland man who took Ozempic and then became legally blind is suing the drug’s manufacturer, arguing it had an obligation to warn patients that loss of sight could be a possible side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Todd Engel, 62, was prescribed Ozempic in 2023 to manage his Type 2 diabetes. The lawsuit said about four months later, Engel was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a condition in which a loss of blood flow to the optic nerve causes sudden and irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;NAION occurs in up to about 10 out of every 100,000 people over age 50, according &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/naion-diagnosis-and-management" target="_blank"&gt;to the American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ozempic and others in the same class of drugs, called GLP-1s, were designed for Type 2 diabetes and have become wildly popular for weight loss in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-may-linked-condition-causes-blindness-research-needed-rcna159991" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies have indicated&lt;/a&gt; that patients prescribed semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, for diabetes or weight loss may be at &lt;a href="https://increased%20risk%20of%20developin/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of developing NAION&lt;/a&gt;. Experts say while evidence is growing that there is an association between Ozempic and NAION, it’s still too early to know definitively if semaglutide raises the risk of developing the condition — especially because diabetes itself is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3786911/" target="_blank"&gt;a risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for NAION and &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticeyeproblems.html" target="_blank"&gt;other eye issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit, filed late Thursday in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, accuses Novo Nordisk of negligence and said it had a duty to provide patients and physicians with information about the risk of serious eye problems. It said Novo Nordisk had access to information dating back as early as its Ozempic clinical trials that identified cases of NAION yet chose not to list the condition on its warning label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Nothing was or is stopping Defendant from adding a warning regarding the risk of NAION,” the lawsuit said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said NAION is not an adverse drug reaction to Ozempic and other GLP-1s. Novo Nordisk said its benefit-risk profile of semaglutide “remains unchanged” after a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and an internal safety assessment, which didn’t suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 use and NAION.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The company added that it takes reports of adverse events seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Jonathan Orent, an attorney for Engel who works for plaintiff litigation firm Motley Rice, said Engel first experienced loss of vision in one eye before eventually becoming legally blind in both. The eye problems forced him to resign from his job as a motor equipment operator for his county’s public works department, made it impossible for him to drive and have forever changed how he interacts with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg" alt="Todd Engel and his wife, Shelley."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Todd Engel and his wife, Shelley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Todd Engel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He made a comment to me about how it’s painful to know he’s never going to see his wife smile again, but he knows her voice so well, he can tell when she is smiling,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He said if Engel had known Ozempic had a possible link to blindness, he would have considered other treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are a wide number of medications that can be used to treat diabetes, and treat it effectively,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit is not the first of its kind. Another law firm recently filed a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parker-waichman-llp-files-one-of-the-first-naion-eye-injury-cases-against-novo-nordisk-in-the-superior-court-of-new-jersey-middlesex-county-302429606.html" target="_blank"&gt;similar suit against Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The litigation comes amid ongoing questions over the link between the drug and NAION. A&lt;a href="https://%202024%20study/" target="_blank"&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that people with diabetes who take semaglutide are over four times more likely to be diagnosed with NAION than people with diabetes who had not been prescribed it. Those who were overweight or obese and did not have diabetes were over seven times more likely to be diagnosed with NAION than those who had not been prescribed it, the study found. But the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-may-linked-condition-causes-blindness-research-needed-rcna159991" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned that more studies are needed&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether there is a causal link between the irreversible vision problems and the drugs, especially because it was a study based on an analysis of six years’ worth of medical records from patients in the Boston area, not a randomized clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In February, a JAMA Ophthalmology &lt;a href="https://study/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested a more modest increase in the risk of NAION among people with Type 2 diabetes who take Ozempic, and also suggested further investigation was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration declined to respond to questions about reports of a possible association between Ozempic and NAION, saying it does not comment on pending litigation. On the FDA’s Adverse Events Reporting System, a public dashboard, there are hundreds of reports from 2024 of eye disorders tied to Ozempic, though the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-public-dashboard" target="_blank"&gt;FDA warns the dashboard data&lt;/a&gt; may contain duplicates and the data has not been independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Andrew Lee, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a neuro-ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, said he is eager for more research to come out on semaglutide, particularly on whether it raises the risk for life-altering eye diseases such as NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a super important question to be able to answer whether Ozempic or any semaglutide causes NAION,” he said. “There’s just so many people on this drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But patients who are concerned should not rush off the drug without speaking to their doctors, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“How many people would you harm if they weren’t on it because they got a stroke or a heart attack or got some other problem?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Engel’s lawsuit seeks damages and a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Hopefully his story will show that there’s another side to this drug that has bought the reputation as being a miracle drug,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTG1hd05HdElPM21xUkc1OXlHaGxNUXRFV3A0U2YteHY1LU9qVnFkOE1IbzFQWW0ydFBRSVFVUGY0and6TUh5c0E3M0FSSXR6LXlGX2JCbWplbTB0VWpzN0ZrOXAwYmxCRzNQVktUc05ER0JXR2RLb1AyMndZNDEwWElmdDNOd3FjaUQxRzZTbUE3VWJLb1E5eHE5OGc4RmlLakd3VFNJUQ</guid></item><item><title>大规模研究将15个因素与早期痴呆风险联系起来- ScienceAlert | Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQWDBMTEVrWmdlMUtPT2lJZDJ2WTN0TjJTeG9zdkJEMnhTbFJtZnZtMlVLdVluYWstdUZ1WjNfSENheHo3OGctVTNSalFIN2JkRzBFbC1oaDAxcU9wTXI5eDNaN3hfcmZHNkFVWEVGc1RrRW93ZTd5UV9HWHRITmZiU3VrYVlkanVhWEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While dementia is much more common in older adults, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/young-onset-dementia"&gt;young-onset dementia&lt;/a&gt; (YOD) each year, and an extensive study published in 2023 sheds some considerable light on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1533317514545825"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; in this area has looked at genetics passed down through generations, but here, the team was able to identify 15 different lifestyle and health factors that are associated with YOD risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the largest and most robust study of its kind ever conducted," &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/risk-of-young-onset-dementia-could-be-reduced-through-targeting-health-and-lifestyle-factors/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist David Llewellyn from the University of Exeter in the UK, when the results were published in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Excitingly, for the first time it reveals that we may be able to take action to reduce risk of this debilitating condition, through targeting a range of different factors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the relationship between alcohol and YOD as "complex".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg" alt="Different hands holding drinks" class="wp-image-146115 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Ketut Subiyanto/Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-easy-strategy-to-reduce-alcohol-intake-scientists-say"&gt;alcohol abuse&lt;/a&gt; led to an increased risk, moderate to heavy drinking correlated with a reduced risk – possibly because people in this second group are usually healthier in general (bear in mind that those who abstain from alcohol often do so on medical grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/education-seems-to-protect-the-gut-not-just-make-you-smarter"&gt;formal education&lt;/a&gt; and lower physical frailty (measured through higher handgrip strength) were also associated with a lower YOD risk. This all helps to fill in some of the knowledge gaps around YOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already knew from research on people who develop dementia at older age that there are a series of modifiable risk factors," &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/risk-of-young-onset-dementia-could-be-reduced-through-targeting-health-and-lifestyle-factors/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neuroepidemiologist Sebastian Köhler from Maastricht University in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to physical factors, mental health also plays an important role, including avoiding chronic stress, loneliness, and depression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results don't prove dementia is caused by these factors, they help build a more detailed picture. As always in this kind of research, knowing more about the causes can help develop better treatments and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-popular-new-weight-loss-drug-may-help-prevent-dementia"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these factors are modifiable, which offers more hope for those working to find ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bodybuilding-supplement-shown-to-stave-off-dementia-in-mice"&gt;beat dementia&lt;/a&gt; rather than just manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-group-of-people-might-benefit-from-taking-fish-oil-to-slow-alzheimers"&gt;may be something we can reduce the risk of&lt;/a&gt; by living healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149335" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149335" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/YoungCoupleRunningExerciseHealthy642.jpg" alt="A young couple running outdoors" class="size-medium wp-image-149335" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/YoungCoupleRunningExerciseHealthy642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/YoungCoupleRunningExerciseHealthy642-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149335" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;We may be able to reduce the risk of dementia by living healthier lives.

&lt;p&gt;"The cause is often assumed to be genetic, but for many people we don't actually know exactly what the cause is. This is why we also wanted to investigate other risk factors in this study."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2813439"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in January 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Colorado on Friday reported its fifth incidence of measles this year, and, for the first time in the spate of cases, the infection was in a person who had been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person, an adult living in Denver, had recently traveled to the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which is seeing an outbreak of measles. Two other cases identified in Colorado — one in a baby in Denver and another in a Pueblo resident — were also connected to travel to Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment identified one location where people may have been exposed to the virus as a result of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Kaiser Permanente urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. in Lakewood between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 19, should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days and consider avoiding public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you may be sick with measles, call ahead to your doctor’s office or emergency clinic before going in to allow the staff to make sure you can be seen without risk of exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-about-breakthrough-measles-infections"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About “breakthrough” measles infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new case is unusual because it is in someone who has verified proof of MMR vaccination. But that doesn’t mean such a so-called &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-breakthrough-cases-vaccination-important/story?id=120276354"&gt;breakthrough infection&lt;/a&gt; is unexpected, said Dr. Ned Calonge, CDPHE’s chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR vaccine are considered 97% effective at stopping an infection — one dose is considered 93% effective. That means on average three out of every 100 vaccinated people who are exposed to the virus will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When that happens, the illness is likely to be more mild, and that is exactly what occurred in the latest Colorado case, Calonge said. He said the infected person is reported to be feeling well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated people who develop an infection are also less infectious toward others, Calonge said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Calonge emphasized that this breakthrough infection does not mean the virus has mutated dangerously or become more adept at evading the immune system. Rather, he said, in rare cases people will not respond to the MMR vaccine or their immunity will wane over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faster-notification"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster notification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While state officials are optimistic about the health system’s readiness to respond to measles infections, some of the earlier cases &lt;a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/04/24/denver-measles-case-public-health/"&gt;saw long delays&lt;/a&gt; in reporting suspected infections. That caused CDPHE to send out reminders to clinics and labs that possible measles cases need to be reported promptly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, via Flickr)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest case, it took nearly a week from the time the person visited the clinic to when the public was told about the confirmed case of measles. But Calonge said the clinic did inform CDPHE right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delay in publicly reporting the infection was because health officials looked at the vaccination status of the person and weren’t certain the test result to confirm a measles infection would come back positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The decision was, based on the vaccination history, that the likelihood was low,” Calonge said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Calonge said anyone who has been tested for measles should isolate themselves until the test result comes back.&lt;/p&gt;

But just how healthy is it to drink orange juice every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know all the facts about starting your day with a glass of OJ, so we got in touch with &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, R.D.N., and Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raj Dasgupta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Raj Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Medical Advisor for Garage Gym Reviews. The bottom line? It's complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Orange juice does have some great perks—like being packed with vitamin C and antioxidants—but drinking it every day isn’t always the best idea," Dr. Dasgupta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Health Benefits Of Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;mrs - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Orange juice is the darling of the immune health-supporting drinks, thanks to the vitamin C it provides," Manaker says. "But OJ is so much more than a vessel for this key nutrient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other key nutrients in orange juice are folate and thiamin. Some OJs are also fortified with vitamin D and calcium, which Manaker says might support bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since most Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and veggies every day, OJ can help bridge the gap in an accessible and versatile way," she adds. So that's good news if you're an orange juice drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Guillermo Murcia - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Potential Risks Of Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, though: Orange juice contains a lot of sugar. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169098/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, an average 8-ounce serving has about 26 grams of carbohydrates and 20 grams of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juicing strips fruit of much of its fiber. A cup of orange juice has zero protein, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/high-protein-high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, or fat, which are nutrients that can help slow the absorption of sugar and prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s easy to forget how much sugar is in even a small glass, and without the fiber you’d get from eating an orange, it can spike your blood sugar quickly," Dr. Dasgupta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to Manaker, even natural sugars can contribute to increased caloric intake and potential weight gain if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And due to its acidity, orange juice could make symptoms worse for anyone with acid reflux or gastritis. She also says people with diabetes or who are managing PCOS might experience elevated blood sugar when drinking &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/orange-juice-espresso-drink/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:orange juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;orange juice&lt;/a&gt; by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For this population, drinking orange juice as they are enjoying a meal or snack that provides protein, fiber, and fat may be a better bet, assuming their healthcare provider approves of them drinking &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/fruit-juice-blends-apple-juice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruit juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fruit juice&lt;/a&gt;," Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pasteurized Vs. Unpasteurized Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also some food safety things to keep in mind when choosing your juice. Unpasteurized OJ is often favored for its fresh taste, but it comes with an increased risk of contamination from bacteria, Manaker says. Pasteurized orange juice undergoes a heat treatment that kills harmful bacteria, but some of the nutritional value and flavors can be lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasteurized orange juice has a longer shelf life, so if you decide to purchase unpasteurized juice, she said you should drink it shortly after it's made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And if you are making it at home, wash the outside of the orange before squeezing to help remove any bacteria that may be on the surface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is it healthy to drink orange juice every day? This depends on several factors, such as your diet and health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a few reasons someone might want to skip orange juice," Dr. Dasgupta says. "If you’re watching your blood sugar, trying to cut back on sugar, or have acid reflux, it might do more harm than good."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a person is relatively healthy and they are not eating enough servings of fruit every day (as most Americans are not), then a glass of OJ every day may be a good idea," Manaker says.

There's also been a sharp uptick in patients suffering from a norovirus-driven stomach bug as well. And cases of one contagious viral infection, which affects the salivary glands and causes painful swelling of the jaw, are rising in the Great Lakes state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; has one of the highest rates of mumps in the U.S., as of April 25th. 11 cases of &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/-/media/Project/Websites/mdhhs/CDINFO/WSR/Current_WSR.pdf"&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Michigan so far, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). The viral infection is spread through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from an infected person. Michigan residents are warned to look for the following symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle aches, loss of appetite, fatigue, and jaw pain. While most people recover within two weeks, serious complications can occur, including hearing loss and swelling of the brain. There is no treatment for mumps. Health officials recommend two doses of the MMR vaccine for protection against mumps, as well as measles and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;10 Items Currently Recalled at Michigan Meijer Stores&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following items have been recalled due to various reasons.

&lt;p&gt;The adult patient — Colorado’s fifth confirmed measles case this year — visited the Kaiser urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. People who spent time in the clinic between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Saturday could have encountered the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other four cases in Colorado this year, the latest patient — who had visited an area of Chihuahua, Mexico — had received the measles vaccine, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. One dose of the vaccine is about 93% effective and two are 97% effective, meaning that some people can still get sick after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cases like this are very rare,” Dr. Ned Calonge, the state health department’s chief medical officer, said in a news release. “Staying up to date on vaccinations and being aware of health risks when traveling are important ways to protect yourself and your community. We’re sharing this information out of an abundance of caution to support early detection and limit the risk of further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who get a breakthrough case are less likely to spread the virus than unvaccinated people, but anyone exposed to the virus should watch for symptoms, including a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, Calonge said. If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call ahead before seeking medical care, so the clinic can keep them away from susceptible patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles patients can spread the virus for about four days before and four days after the characteristic rash develops. Symptoms can show up seven to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent case is the fourth in Colorado linked to travel to Mexico, where the virus is spreading after an outbreak in Texas spilled across the border. The other three patients were a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;Pueblo County adult&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;Denver infant&lt;/a&gt; and a person of unspecified age who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;lived in the same home as the baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Archuleta County adult also developed measles. That person didn’t travel, and health officials &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;aren’t sure where they got the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, 29 states have reported a combined 884 measles cases this year, which is more than triple the total last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210#cdc_data_surveillance_section_8-previous-years"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority — 646 — are in Texas, where an outbreak in the western part of the state that’s approaching the three-month mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As of Friday, April 25, the US has confirmed over 900 measles cases since the start of the year. The cases are across 29 states, but most are in or near Texas, where a massive outbreak continues to mushroom in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;884 cases across the country&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the Texas health department updated its outbreak total, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;adding 22 cases&lt;/a&gt; to its last count from Tuesday. That brings the national total to at least 906 confirmed cases. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated children and teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Texas has identified 664 cases since late January. Of those, 64 patients have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying medical conditions have died of the disease. An unvaccinated adult in New Mexico also died from the infection, bringing this year's measles death toll to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases and deaths are breaking records. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_5-yearly-measles-cases"&gt;In the past 30 years&lt;/a&gt;, the only year with more measles cases than the current tally was 2019, which saw 1,274 cases. Most of those cases were linked to large, extended outbreaks in New York City that took 11 months to quell. The US was just weeks away from losing its elimination status, an achievement earned in 2000 when the country first went 12 months without continuous transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, vaccination coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among US kindergartners has only fallen. National rates fell from 95 percent in 2019—the threshold considered necessary to keep measles from spreading—to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;92.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the 2023–24 school year, the most recent year for which there's data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the brink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, amid the record annual case tally, cases had only reached &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817e1.htm"&gt;a total of 704 by April 26&lt;/a&gt;. With this year's tally already over 900, the country is on track to record a new high. Before 2019, the next highest case total for measles was in 1994. That year, the country saw 899 cases, which 2025 has already surpassed.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.066" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that the distribution of body fat—not just overall body weight—may play a meaningful role in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While obesity and depression are known to often co-occur, many past studies have relied on body mass index (BMI) to define obesity. But BMI doesn’t distinguish between fat and muscle, nor does it capture where fat is located in the body. This limitation has led to mixed results in previous research. The current study aimed to take a closer look by using more precise tools to measure fat percentage in specific areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from 10,694 adults who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative study conducted in the United States. These participants had completed full-body scans using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a technology that accurately measures fat, muscle, and bone. The scans allowed the researchers to analyze fat percentage in eight distinct regions: the legs, arms, trunk, head, android (abdominal), gynoid (hips and thighs), subtotal (excluding the head), and total body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess depression, the study used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a validated self-report measure of depressive symptoms. A score of 10 or higher on the PHQ-9 was used as a cutoff for clinically significant depression. Researchers also collected information about participants’ lifestyle habits, socioeconomic status, medical conditions, and biological markers, which allowed them to adjust their statistical models for many possible confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people in the highest quartile for total body fat had a significantly higher likelihood of reporting depression compared to those in the lowest quartile. This association remained even after adjusting for a wide range of demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables. Notably, the strongest associations were found for fat located in the legs, gynoid area, and subtotal region. People with higher head fat percentage also showed a modest increase in depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined differences by sex, they found that the association between body fat and depression was stronger in men than in women. This was especially true for fat in the legs and total body fat. In contrast, the connection was weaker or absent in women, except for some regions. This suggests that the effects of fat distribution on mood may operate differently depending on biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether the association varied across different BMI categories. Among individuals who were underweight or overweight, higher body fat percentages in several regions were consistently linked with increased depression risk. Interestingly, this pattern was not as clear in participants with a BMI in the normal range. This finding challenges the assumption that normal-weight individuals are at low risk for depression related to fat accumulation and highlights the importance of examining fat distribution rather than relying on weight alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest several possible explanations for these patterns. Biologically, excess fat tissue produces inflammatory molecules that may interfere with brain function and mood regulation. Hormones like leptin, which help control hunger and metabolism, can also become dysregulated in people with higher fat percentages, possibly affecting brain systems involved in emotion. Psychosocial factors may also play a role. Individuals with higher body fat, especially in visible areas, might experience greater stigma or body dissatisfaction, both of which can contribute to depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to a growing body of evidence that body composition—and where fat is stored—can affect mental well-being. While BMI has long been the go-to measure in public health and clinical settings, this study shows that it may be too blunt an instrument to capture the nuances of how body fat influences mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, the study has some limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it cannot determine whether higher body fat leads to depression or whether depression contributes to changes in body composition. Depression itself can influence eating habits, physical activity, and metabolic processes, which could alter body fat levels over time. The study also relied on a single self-report questionnaire to assess depression, without clinical interviews or additional mental health screenings. Moreover, since the research focused on a United States population, the findings may not apply to other cultural or healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by following participants over time to explore how changes in fat distribution might influence mental health. It would also be useful to examine how interventions that reduce specific types of body fat—through diet, exercise, or other means—might affect depression symptoms, especially in men or in people whose weight falls outside the typical range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.066" target="_blank"&gt;Association between body fat percentage and depression: A cross-sectional study of NHANES&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Wenjun Gu, Kunming Bao, Xiaoming Li, Shaohang Xiang, Junhao He, Jinning He, Lixin Ye, and Zhidong Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 22:03:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPRFhPNURvT3JXQmdNdTV0Si02NXVCakg2WXNCWERqVndIMlVEaHdlc19VX3hKcGRRSm11Y2Fucm5FbUtXYmdZajBKYTYtOWxfQ05aUXNCb1FmZkc2Nmd5WkltN2hsb2pfN1BnZ2xVbFZHc2hUMXlMcVhwNktKa0VyNXAxeDVTc2xTeUFDSFFR</guid></item><item><title>Austin Public Health表示，当地报告了第二例麻疹病例- KUT | Second measles case reported locally, Austin Public Health says - KUT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQR0t1dkhPSzhjRG9LNnc0VlJ3N05sN3ZFaGZSMG8tZjBPRGh4M3JMY3pndlN5VEVZTnhYUHFwRWFETXFETG9ZT2RJRHV3UTZIMmFTVUFtcVZRS1diMWZ6X2NBel9JWXNpZnFBUXFjbmxiUnpKOUEwUmhabXBSX1lhemRtdWVDYW5oUlpKWEwtcVRndjR0cG5qdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArtP-articleBody"&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;A Travis County adult is isolating after testing positive for measles, Austin Public Health officials announced Friday. It is the second confirmed local case of the virus this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/austintexas/second-measles-case-reported-in-travis-county?e=b0a255979d" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;representatives said&lt;/a&gt; the sick individual may have been exposed to the virus while traveling in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient visited a state outside of Texas that is experiencing a rise in measles cases," APH spokesperson William Malm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual was reportedly vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious disease that can have severe complications. Typically, two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine offers 97% protection against the measles virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While a vaccinated person can still get measles, they are more likely to experience mild symptoms and are less likely to spread it,” Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority, said in a statement. “We consider measles to be one of the most contagious viruses we know and getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walkes said people who are vaccinated should check with their doctors to see if they should get a booster dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH shared locations where the sick person may have exposed others. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Office building at 300 Colorado St., Wednesday, April 16&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maaribu Coffee Shop, 1413 S. First St., Thursday, April 17, 8:45 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curra’s Restaurant, 614 E. Oltorf St., Thursday, April 17,  5:45 – 9:30 p.m. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starbucks 1920 E.

Riverside Drive, Suite A110, Sunday, April 20, 8 a.m. - 12 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH said more locations could be added to the list as contact tracing continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at the listed locations during the timeframe identified should monitor for symptoms including rash, cough and fever, through May 11, APH said. Those who are pregnant and unvaccinated, or generally immunocompromised, and visited those locations during those times should contact their doctors now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February, APH announced a measles case in an unvaccinated infant, who contracted the virus while traveling internationally with family. No additional exposures were announced following that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a measles outbreak is ongoing in West Texas, where more than 600 people have tested positive this year. Sixty-four of those individuals have been hospitalized. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the vast majority of those cases involve people who were not vaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

Using AI, the team revealed that PHGDH has a hidden DNA-binding function unrelated to its known enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This malfunction triggers early Alzheimer’s development, offering a new target for prevention. They also identified a small molecule, NCT-503, that blocks this harmful activity without affecting normal brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Role of PHGDH:&lt;/strong&gt; AI revealed PHGDH acts as a DNA-binding disruptor, leading to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapeutic Candidate:&lt;/strong&gt; The small molecule NCT-503 blocks the harmful function without impairing normal activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated mice showed memory and anxiety improvements, suggesting clinical potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study found that a gene recently recognized as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease is actually a cause of it, due to its previously unknown secondary function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego used artificial intelligence to help both unravel this mystery of Alzheimer’s disease and discover a potential treatment that obstructs the gene’s moonlighting role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109165"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When the researchers tested NCT-503 in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they saw that it significantly alleviated Alzheimer’s progression. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team published their results on April 23 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in nine people aged 65 and older has Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia. While some particular genes, when mutated, can lead to Alzheimer’s, that connection only accounts for a small percentage of all Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of patients do not have a mutation in a known disease-causing gene; instead, they have “spontaneous” Alzheimer’s, and the causes for that are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering those causes could ultimately improve medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease are very limited. And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment,” said study senior author Sheng Zhong, a professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Zhong and his team took a closer look at phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which they had previously discovered as a potential blood biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, they later found that expression levels of the PHGDH gene directly correlated with changes in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease; in other words, the higher the levels of protein and RNA produced by the PHGDH gene, the more advanced the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That correlation has since been verified in multiple cohorts from different medical centers, according to Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by this reproducible correlation, the research team decided to investigate in this latest study whether there was a causal effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice and human brain organoids, the researchers found that altering the amounts of PHGDH expression had consequential effects on Alzheimer’s disease: lower levels corresponded to less disease progression, whereas increasing the levels led to more disease advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the researchers established that PHGDH is indeed a causal gene to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In further support of that finding, the researchers determined—with the help of AI—that PHGDH plays a previously undiscovered role: it triggers a pathway that disrupts how cells in the brain turn genes on and off. And such a disturbance can cause issues, like the development of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moonlighting role&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHGDH creates an enzyme key for the production of serine, an essential amino acid and a neurotransmitter. Because PHGDH’s enzymatic activity was its only known role, the researchers hypothesized that its metabolic function must be connected to an Alzheimer’s outcome. However, all their experiments designed to prove so failed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At that time, our study hit a wall, and we didn’t have a clue of what mechanism it is,” said Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another Alzheimer’s project in his lab, which did not focus on PHGDH, changed all this. A year ago, that project revealed a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease: a widespread imbalance in the brain in the process where cells control which genes are turned on and off to carry out their specific roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were curious if PHGDH had an unknown regulatory role in that process, and they turned to modern AI for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AI, they could visualize the three-dimensional structure of the PHGDH protein. Within that structure, they discovered that the protein has a substructure that is very similar to a known DNA-binding domain in a class of known transcription factors. The similarity is solely in the structure and not in the protein sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhong said, “It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discovering the substructure, the team then demonstrated that with it, the protein can activate two critical target genes. That throws off the delicate balance, leading to several problems and eventually the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, PHGDH has a previously unknown role, independent of its enzymatic function, that through a novel pathway leads to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ties back to the team’s earlier studies: the PHGDH gene produced more proteins in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to the control brains, and those increased amounts of the protein in the brain triggered the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everyone has the PHGDH gene, the difference comes down to the expression level of the gene, or how many proteins are made by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Treatment option&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the researchers uncovered the mechanism, they wanted to figure out how to intervene and thus possibly identify a therapeutic candidate, which could help target the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many current treatments focus on treating the abnormal buildup of the sticky protein called beta-amyloid in the brain, some studies suggest that treating those plaques may be ineffective: essentially by that stage of accumulation, treatment is too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the critical pathway discovered in this study is upstream, so preventing this pathway can reduce amyloid plaque formation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that PHGDH is such an important enzyme, there are past studies on its possible inhibitors. One small molecule, known as NCT-503, stood out to the researchers because it is not quite effective at impeding PHGDH’s enzymatic activity (the production of serine), which they did not want to change. NCT-503 is also able to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier, which is a desirable characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They turned to AI again for three-dimensional visualization and modeling. They found that NCT-503 can access that DNA-binding substructure of PHGDH, thanks to a binding pocket. With more testing, they saw that NCT-503 does indeed inhibit PHGDH’s regulatory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested NCT-503 in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they saw that it significantly alleviated Alzheimer’s progression. The treated mice demonstrated substantial improvement in their memory and anxiety tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests were chosen because Alzheimer’s patients suffer from cognitive decline and increased anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers do acknowledge limitations of their study. One being that there is no perfect animal model for spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. They could test NCT-503 only in the mouse models that are available, which are those with mutations in those known disease-causing genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the results are promising, according to Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests,” said Zhong. “There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An advantage of small molecules is that they could even be administered orally, he added, unlike the current treatments that require infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps will be to optimize the compound and subject it to FDA IND-enabling studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#513d3d3033383e2211243222357f343524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liezel Labios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu"&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liezel Labios – UCSD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Transcriptional regulation by PHGDH drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Sheng Zhong et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcriptional regulation by PHGDH drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually all individuals aged 65 or older develop at least early pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet most lack disease-causing mutations in APP, PSEN, or MAPT, and many do not carry the APOE4 risk allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises questions about AD development in the general population. Although transcriptional dysregulation has not traditionally been a hallmark of AD, recent studies reveal significant epigenomic changes in late-onset AD (LOAD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that altered expression of the LOAD biomarker phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) modulates AD pathology in mice and human brain organoids independent of its enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHGDH has an uncharacterized role in transcriptional regulation, promoting the transcription of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKKa) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in astrocytes, which suppress autophagy and accelerate amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood-brain-barrier-permeable small-molecule inhibitor targeting PHGDH’s transcriptional function reduces amyloid pathology and improves AD-related behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight transcriptional regulation in LOAD and suggest therapeutic strategies beyond targeting familial mutations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 21:27:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9EN1dVRzdCdFhRTGdiemh5NUNQVjNWeDhqLUd2dnRtQTZxcVM5U0lscFlRQ0U2eDQyQjBtSWZJNFB0QmhZMTF6TkNZaUlDQ19SMkVpMjlTZ2FMX2JEQ2M1RTRobUlJZVlxZXc</guid></item><item><title>猪可以再生成人的牙齿。如果人类也可以呢？ - Phys.org | Pigs can regrow their adult teeth.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When children lose their baby teeth, there is an adult set already growing beneath the gums, ready to emerge. But if we lose our permanent teeth, there aren't any more waiting in the wings. Right now, the options for replacing these lost teeth are either dentures or titanium implants, neither of which provide the same function and feedback as a real, living tooth.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Pamela Yelick, AG89, a professor at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, wants to be able to grow new, living teeth to replace those we've lost. In a paper &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/stcltm/article/doi/10.1093/stcltm/szae076/7933795" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2024 in &lt;i&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, Yelick and her colleagues showed that they could grow human-like teeth in pigs using a combination of human and pig tooth cells. The work is a significant step toward replacing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+implants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt; with bioengineered living teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental implants typically have a base of titanium, which is anchored into the jawbone. Titanium integrates well with bone, but it doesn't have the soft tissue that surrounds a natural tooth root to cushion chewing forces and promote healthy bone turnover, or nerves to provide sensory feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the implant isn't perfectly aligned, or a person is chewing too hard, the bone around the implant can start to break down and be absorbed back into the body. This creates opportunities for bacteria to reach the implant, which can accelerate bone resorption and eventually cause the implant to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even creating a tooth root that you could put an artificial crown on—with living dental pulp in the middle, secured by periodontal ligaments instead of being screwed into the jaw—could be a huge improvement to a person's oral health and in turn, systemic health," says Yelick, who also holds appointments in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and in the School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Prompting the body to grow new teeth isn't easy. Our teeth start as a tooth bud—a little bulb of cells inside the jaw—which grows and differentiates into all the hard and soft tissues that make up a tooth and connect it to the jaw. The researchers needed to create their own bioengineered tooth bud with the right cell types and instructions to grow into a tooth on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooth bud is made of two types of cells: dental epithelial cells, which produce &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/tooth+enamel/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tooth enamel&lt;/a&gt;, and dental mesenchymal cells, which eventually form the rest of the tooth, including the dental pulp, dentin, cementum, and periodontal ligament tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelick and her team were able to collect dental mesenchymal cells from the pulp of extracted human wisdom teeth and other healthy teeth removed for orthodontic reasons, but dental epithelial cells are only present in the very early stages of tooth development. They can't be collected from people once our teeth have been formed. They can, however, be collected from unerupted teeth present in pig jaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike humans, pigs can grow multiple sets of adult teeth, so their adult jaws contain additional tooth buds. The researchers acquired pig jaws that would otherwise have been discarded from slaughterhouses and were able to extract tooth buds from them. They cultured these dental cells, as well as cells from human teeth, in the lab and then added them to a bioengineered scaffold that helped provide the necessary cues to start tooth development. Then they implanted these bioengineered tooth buds into the jaws of adult pigs, and monitored the animals for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the bioengineered teeth developed at a similar rate as natural pig teeth, which is fairly close to that of human teeth. Because the experiment was only planned for three months, the teeth did not have a chance to emerge through the gums, but they underwent the same developmental stages as natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that we could make these beautiful little teeth," Yelick says. "They're still in the jaw—they haven't erupted yet—but they look just like natural human teeth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelick and her colleagues hope to follow the tooth development for a longer duration in future experiments. They are also investigating the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/signaling+molecules/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;signaling molecules&lt;/a&gt; that direct cell behavior, looking for ways to initiate tooth growth from within the jaw instead of needing to extract and culture cells separately in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ultimate goal is to be able to prompt cells within a person's jaw to grow new, entirely human teeth—no pig cells required. There is still more work to be done before the researchers are able to grow a living replacement for a human tooth, but Yelick thinks it is achievable in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, you keep your teeth as long as possible. That's the best scenario," Yelick says. "But if something happens, we hope to have biological tooth substitutes available."&lt;/p&gt;

You cook your protein and your veggies all together, so they can absorb each other’s flavors and the flavors of whatever you season or dress them with. And when dinner is done, you just have one pan to clean. What is also satisfying about these sheet-pan dinners is that they’re all packed with protein, delivering 15 grams or more per serving. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is not only essential for muscle growth and repair but it also helps you feel fuller for longer and supports your immune system, among other benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These sheet-pan tacos are so satisfyingly crispy and crunchy. Pureeing the black beans in the food processor with taco seasoning, chipotles, salsa and some homemade crema makes a boldly flavored bean spread. Just spread it on the tortillas, add a little cheese, fold them in half and bake.

And choosing a salt-free version adds lots of flavor, negating the need for added salt. Once the chicken has roasted for 10 minutes, you’ll add some broccoli florets and cherry tomatoes to the pan to cook until tender. For a final touch and contrasting creamy texture, sprinkle crumbled feta on top. Serve everything with the pan juices and some whole-grain bread.

Using eye-tracking technology, researchers found that over 800 children from Sweden, Uganda, Bhutan, and Zimbabwe equally followed social cues like shared attention, regardless of poverty, trauma, or parental mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges long-held assumptions about early vulnerability and highlights the resilience of infant development even in hardship. While not all aspects of development are spared, the findings offer hope for the potential of early social learning in all children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Cultural Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Infants from war-torn or impoverished environments showed similar social cue-following as peers in secure homes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye-Tracking Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers used eye movement tracking to measure social attention in over 800 babies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Stress Considered:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite parental trauma or depression, infants’ ability to share attention was not impaired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babies living as refugees have some of the same social skills as children with more secure home conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is shown by a new study that researchers from Uppsala University have conducted in cooperation with colleagues in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Bhutan. Over 800 children participated in the study, making it one of the largest infant studies ever conducted using eye movement measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109157"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows babies." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The questions in the forms were put to the participants by a local research assistant who could explain and contextualise the question.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by the results. Previous research has shown – and we ourselves assumed– that the early infancy period is extremely vulnerable. That children’s development is influenced by the social, security and economic conditions in which they spend their early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we saw in our study that children living in insecurity are not doomed. Some important social skills are intact. This inspires hope, though it doesn’t mean everything is all right,” says Gustaf Gredebäck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in Bhutan, Sweden, Uganda and Zimbabwe, and involved researchers in peace and conflict studies, game design and psychology. Between 100 and 300 children in each country participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows that regardless of poverty, traumatic experiences in the family, experiences of hunger, war and deep depression in parents, babies are equally good at following social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obtain a picture of the child’s background and circumstances, the researchers interviewed the child’s parents. They were asked to talk about their experiences of trauma and how they were feeling, and their response was used as an indicator of the parents’ wellbeing status and of their available resources to be a good enough parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationally established concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all the countries, both children living in secure conditions with parents who were well and children living in troubled conditions with parents who were not well were studied. Trauma from war was only present in children in Uganda, but poverty was present in families in many countries and depression was present in all the countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of traumatic events and poverty was based on established internationally validated scales and local differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions in the forms were put to the participants by a local research assistant who could explain and contextualise the question. It was often mental wellbeing issues that needed to be related to different concepts and patterns of thought in different countries. For poverty, country-specific indicators were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye movement measurements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the children’s social activity and ability to follow what was happening around them, the researchers used eye movement measurements, filming children’s eyes and using an algorithm to calculate where the child was looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, it is possible to measure the extent to which a child follows the direction in which someone else is looking, i.e. what they are interested in and how they read what others are interested in. The children are involved in a process of sharing attention with other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By exploring the same ability in very different families in a new way, we can gain a deeper understanding of what we all have in common, the innate abilities that develop early in life. This is important for several reasons,” Gredebäck says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study gives hope and shows that early childhood holds opportunities for learning and development for all children, including those living in some of the most insecure environments in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers at Kabale University in Uganda, the University of Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe and Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences in Bhutan. From Uppsala University, researchers in peace and conflict studies, game design and psychology participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The project is funded by the Wallenberg Academy Fellows Programme, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW 2012.0120 and KAW 2017.0284).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social development and child trauma research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gustaf Gredebäck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gustaf Gredebäck – Uppsala University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251331042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Infant Gaze Following Is Stable Across Markedly Different Cultures and Resilient to Family Adversities Associated With War and Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;” by Gustaf Gredebäck et al. &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infant Gaze Following Is Stable Across Markedly Different Cultures and Resilient to Family Adversities Associated With War and Climate Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaze following in infancy allows triadic social interactions and a comprehension of other individuals and their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance for early development, its ontology is debated, with theories suggesting that gaze following is either a universal core capacity or an experience-dependent learned behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critical test of these theories among 809 nine-month-olds from Africa (Uganda and Zimbabwe), Europe (Sweden), and Asia (Bhutan) demonstrated that infants follow gaze to a similar degree regardless of environmental factors such as culture, maternal well-being (postpartum depression, well-being), or traumatic family events (related to war and/or climate change).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that gaze following may be a universal, experience-expectant process that is resilient to adversity and similar across a wide range of human experiences—a core foundation for social development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:28:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1oQnViRXZVT1Bxek45WEtrT25jZ2t0cjNsU2w5UWEyUFlTOHp6SDQ0SVdFdnV1RE9vWFliUmlGQ0pPMmIxekhGay1xd2poakNGZDdVTVpIclNqQ0EyN3RhWTdGUGFmNVhBQmMyZFJjUQ</guid></item><item><title>低度和中度运动可能有助于预防阿尔茨海默氏症的衰退-神经科学新闻 | Low and Moderate Exercise May Help Prevent Alzheimer’s Decline - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9uQUVzVlk5WXpiZUhUZkdHT0tpY1E0UGFVRURTSFVtSEJHQVhTY05MVG53dkVHV081anVOMEdUcFFGbWszeElISHJfclhvXzR4aThEeF8zZ0ZFNjRMTUZKZlRWRTdneWpiaXhmV1pR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New findings from the EXERT study reveal that both low and moderate-high intensity exercise may help preserve cognitive function in older adults with mild memory problems—a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Over 12 months, participants who engaged in either form of exercise showed significantly less cognitive decline and reduced brain volume loss, especially in the prefrontal cortex, compared to a usual-care group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the value of accessible, community-based fitness interventions for individuals at high risk of dementia. Even low-intensity activities like stretching and balance exercises proved effective in slowing decline, suggesting a simple and feasible path toward brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowed Decline:&lt;/strong&gt; Both low and moderate-high intensity exercise stabilized cognitive function over 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Volume Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants in both exercise groups showed less brain volume loss, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Feasibility:&lt;/strong&gt; The trial partnered with local YMCAs, showing real-world implementation is possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at University of California San Diego and Wake Forest University have found that both low and moderate-high intensity exercise could be valuable tools in the fight against Alzheimer’s. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published as two papers in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;, describes the results of the EXERT study (Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems), a multi-site clinical trial of lower or moderate-high intensity exercise in sedentary older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109133"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older lady exercising and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This suggests that both lower and higher intensity exercise could slow cognitive decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared their results to an existing dataset of comparable individuals who only received usual care, such as regular check-ups with health care providers and medication management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In EXERT participants, cognitive function remained stable over 12 months in both low and moderate-high intensity exercise groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both forms of exercise were associated with significantly less cognitive decline over 12 months when compared to individuals who were not involved in the exercise study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both EXERT exercise groups tended to show less brain volume loss over 12 months, including in the prefrontal cortex.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition characterized by memory complaints and objective memory decline, are at high risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia, with approximately 16% of people with this condition progressing to Alzheimer’s each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a critical time to intervene in this population, because they don’t have dementia yet, but are at a very high risk,” said Aladdin Shadyab, Ph.D., M.P.H., lead author of one of the new papers and associate professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science and School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, these findings show us that even low intensity exercise may slow cognitive decline in at-risk older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have suggested that exercise may be beneficial for cognitive health, the evidence has been mixed, and large, well-designed studies are needed to fully understand the potential benefits of exercise for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EXERT study, coordinated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at UC San Diego, in partnership with Wake Forest University School of Medicine, fills this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EXERT was one of the first large clinical trials of exercise that partnered with the YMCA and its trainers to bring the intervention closer to home for research participants,” said Howard Feldman, M.D., ADCS director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach brings us one step closer to its implementation in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADCS was formed in 1991 under a cooperative agreement between the National Institute on Aging and UC San Diego and is one of the key initiatives for Alzheimer’s research supported by the federal government, addressing treatments for both cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s an urgent need to identify effective and feasible ways to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s dementia, and UC San Diego has been a leader in this field for many years,” added Feldman, who is also a professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXERT included nearly 300 sedentary older adults with mild cognitive impairment who were randomly assigned to either moderate-high intensity aerobic training or lower-intensity stretching, balance and range of motion activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed their assigned exercise 3-4 times per week for 12 months under the supervision of a YMCA trainer, and the study also included regular assessments of cognitive function and brain volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EXERT is a landmark study because it’s the largest rigorous trial of exercise ever conducted in adults with mild cognitive impairment,” said Laura Baker, Ph.D., principal investigator of the EXERT study and professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise has well-documented benefits to nearly every aspect of human health, but we’re still unlocking the full potential of exercise as medicine for older adults with memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the researchers expected to see further cognitive decline in EXERT participants, they actually found that cognitive function remained stable for both exercise groups over the course of the study. This suggests that both lower and higher intensity exercise could slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation for the results is that participating in research itself, regardless of the treatment, may offer protection against cognitive decline due to the intellectual and social stimulation involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings of both studies taken together suggest that exercise may be a promising, safe, and feasible strategy to promote brain health and prevent continued cognitive decline for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s still a lot to learn, these findings show that regular intensity exercise, even at low intensity, could go a long way toward helping older adults slow or delay cognitive decline, and this is promising news for those who are at high risk for dementia,” added Shadyab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The EXERT study was supported through the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (U19AG010483-25 and AG058644) and by the Brain Research Foundation (BRF ECD-2014-01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosures:&lt;/strong&gt; Feldman receives grant funding from the National Institute on Aging (U19AG010483-22), from Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Vivoryon (Probiodrug), and LuMind Foundation; service agreements for consulting activities with LuMind, Axon Neuroscience, Novo Nordisk, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Roche/Genentech Pharmaceuticals (DMC/DSMB), Tau Consortium (SAB), and Janssen Research &amp;amp; Development (DSMB); support for travel from Novo Nordisk, Royal Society of Canada, Translating Research in Elder Care (TREC), Association for Frontotemporal Dementia (AFTD), and Rainwater Charitable Foundation; and a philanthropic donation for the Epstein Family Alzheimer Research Collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No personal funds have been received for these activities.

Researchers found that clusters of serotonin neurons compete and collaborate, shaping when and how serotonin is released throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery challenges older views of a uniform serotonin signal and may have major implications for understanding mood disorders and how the brain handles binary decisions. The team identified a brain circuit involving the lateral habenula that helps compute “go” or “don’t go” decisions in response to perceived threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serotonin Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons form interconnected ensembles that regulate dynamic serotonin release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Circuits:&lt;/strong&gt; A newly identified circuit links the lateral habenula to serotonin activity, guiding binary decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This new understanding could inform targeted therapies for mood disorders like depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our lives are filled with binary decisions – choices between one of two alternatives. But what’s really happening inside our brains when we engage in this kind of decision-making?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine-led study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; sheds new light on these big questions, illuminating a general principle of neural processing in a mysterious region of the midbrain that is the very origin of our central serotonin (5-HT) system, a key part of the nervous system involved in a remarkable range of cognitive and behavioral functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109153"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a person at a cross roads." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team’s work has implications for how our brain – an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections – is involved in day-to-day decision making. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current dominating model is that individual 5-HT neurons are acting independently one from another. While it had previously been suggested that 5-HT neurons may rather be connected with one another, it had not been directly demonstrated. That is what we did here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also identify an intriguing processing role – or a computation – that is supported by this particular type of connectivity between 5-HT neurons,” says Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, full professor in the Faculty’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and co-director of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international research team’s work involved a mixture of several experimental approaches such as electrophysiology, cellular imaging, optogenetics and behavioral approaches, along with mathematical modeling and computer simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forging advances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean that serotonin neurons clustered together in the brainstem are not independent actors largely keeping to themselves but are actually sending axons to the rest of the brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my view, the paper’s main takeaway is that the mammalian serotonin system is far more anatomically and functionally complex than what we previously imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is knowledge that could potentially help develop targeted therapeutics for mood disorders like major depressive disorder,” says Dr. Michael Lynn, the study’s first author and a former member of Dr. Béïque’s Faculty of Medicine lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lynn received his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Ottawa in October 2023. He’s now working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford, in the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the team’s findings are important because it turns out that there are distinct groups of serotonin neurons with their own activity patterns, each controlling serotonin release in a particular region of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has implications for the “winner-takes-all” principle of neuroscience – an idea applied in computational models of neural networks in which neurons essentially compete to get activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new principles uncovered in this paper suggest that these distinct ensembles can interact in some scenarios: ‘winning’ serotonin ensembles with high activity can strongly reduce serotonin release from ‘losing’ serotonin ensembles with lower activity levels,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These imply a more complex, dynamic set of rules about how and when serotonin is released throughout the brain, contrasting with an older view of a more monolithic signal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s work has implications for how our brain – an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections – is involved in day-to-day decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They determined how the lateral habenula, a region that is activated when we are frustrated and that is implicated in major depression, ultimately controls the activity of serotonin neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habenular neurons are also believed to encode the level of threat that is perceived from a particular environment, or perhaps even from our actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Béïque explains it like this: “Do we jump from the high diving board at the pool? Or only from the low one? Do we walk down that very dark alley, or do we avoid it?  When is dark too dark?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Somehow our brain must compute features of our world – including how threatening a particular environment is – and come up with a binary output: you go, or you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think we have identified a circuit that participates in that very computation that guides our everyday decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for the research team as they build on the advances they have forged over several years with this methodical, innovative examination of the serotonin system? They aim to focus on behavioral studies with mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, the behavioral manifestations of the computation we discovered were somewhat artificial behavior. We’re currently trying to see if we can see similar things when mice are behaving in more naturalistic environments,” Dr. Béïque says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talent-rich research team for the new &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper included the uOttawa Faculty of Medicine’s Dr. Richard Naud, a computational neuroscientist who was the senior author on a recent serotonin-related study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and Sean Geddes, director of Innovation and Partnerships at Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this serotonin and decision-making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6c6dad9d1d9c2ded3f6c3d9c2c2d7c1d798d5d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul Logothetis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paul Logothetis – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01912-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nonlinear recurrent inhibition through facilitating serotonin release in the raphe&lt;/a&gt;” by Jean-Claude Béïque et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonlinear recurrent inhibition through facilitating serotonin release in the raphe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a constellation of long-range inputs, yet guiding principles of local circuit organization and underlying computations in this nucleus are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using inputs from the lateral habenula to interrogate the processing features of the mouse DRN, we uncovered 5-HT1A receptor-mediated recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular electrophysiology and imaging of a genetically encoded 5-HT sensor revealed that these recurrent inhibitory connections spanned the raphe, were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating and gated spike output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features collectively conveyed highly nonlinear dynamics to this network, generating excitation-driven inhibition and winner-take-all computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vivo optogenetic activation of lateral habenula inputs to DRN, at frequencies where these computations are predicted to ignite, transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

in the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-028a6640-2209-11f0-9741-3dbcd068db7a"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; drug supply in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the year, officials found 46 people who had died from fatal drug overdoses over the year had consumed medetomidine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts are warning it has now made its way into three-quarters of the illicit drug supply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Lynch, an emergency medicine doctor at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said: 'We know it's probably in about half to three-quarters of our drug supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It can] depress your breathing a little bit, lowers your heart rate, and, to a lesser degree, can lower your blood pressure. And it can last for several hours where people are very, very sleepy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Officials are warning that medetomidine, a drug used for sedation and pain relief in pet dogs and cats, is being mixed with fentanyl and other opioids and sold in multiple states. (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told CBS: 'It is so different and so severe and progresses so rapidly and doesn't respond to the usual treatments that we use for withdrawal from different substances like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-4e0c7e20-21ee-11f0-bb9f-d7e91671f6a4" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; or opioids or benzodiazepines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medetomidine was also detected in several seized drug samples across Maryland in July 2022, suggesting the drug is spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended dose of medetomidine for dogs is 750 micrograms and less than 20 mg for cats given through an IV drip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite not being intended for use in humans, there is another form of medetomidine, sold under brand names Dexdor and Precedex, that is used for sedation and muscle relaxation in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It remains unclear how much of medetomidine can be lethal to human life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medetomidine is often cut with other drugs like fentanyl because when mixed with opioids and other substances, it greatly increases the sedative effects of each drug, which people may perceive as a better or stronger product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sedative has most frequently been observed in samples containing fentanyl and xylazine, but the drug has also been identified together with heroin and cocaine, the Center for Forensic Science Research and Education said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to dropping the heart rate dangerously low, it can cause serious effects such as hallucinations and last longer than other illicit substances it is mixed with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug, which is estimated to be 200 times more powerful than xylazine, also slows neurological functions in the body, resulting in confusion and lethargy, as well as symptoms of opioid overdose like shallow breathing and small pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drug is not intended for long-term human use and can make dangerous changes to heart rate and mental state - leaving patients in a state of extreme sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: People, some with drug dependency issues sit along a sidewalk in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some medetomidine overdose symptoms include uncontrollable vomiting, excessive sweating, life-threatening levels of blood pressure, fluctuating mental state, tremors and a heart rate over 100 beats a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health has asked healthcare providers to use naloxone, usually used to treat opioids as treatment against medetomidine overdose - despite the latter drug not being an opioid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication works by attaching itself to medetomidine receptors and reverses and blocks the effects of it by neutralizing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can quickly restore normal breathing if it has slowed or stopped due to an overdose and help the body return to its a normal state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raagini Jawa, infectious disease and addiction medicine physician at UPMC told the Post Gazette: 'Naloxone is still the first-line agent for overdose reversal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We really need to educate people about rescue breathing and making sure we’re protecting their airways and calling for help, so that if they need oxygen, emergency services can provide supplemental oxygen support for them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 19:43:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOMGRJZ0JKNU81WW9YeUU0SUhEc0pxb29oajk2QUpvaGlsaEd6bC11b3lkZXk2M0k3U01jYUdBMm1PaHVxZENmSDNyU1RFRkRfYTVzS0hzeU9mcjk5WDlLV1NpMUxyN1pqQnNZZk85dDJlbEdseGJBYXl4Tkp0VElaSmx6QVd3ZjdDU0lHeVpnNllFbTdwOTc3RVhrQ1JRSFFMckHSAacBQVVfeXFMTV9QUzRUem1wUi1qdzUxVkd4MnhUazU5S0NzNTFZakt1R2RXaWx2QjNSVXBYNk5rNzZMTEtrSUVMS3VJTEgxNV9uY2RLc0FaNGE5cHltQW14RGNUWEVzaERlcXRnRzNkc0hIcHJ3eXpTV3l6a2hDV1lRTHJ2OXRScmpXRVhSby1vOTUzVjY0Q2tsM3JLbDJEMC13QV9CYkxqQUUyaS1QYkU</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州报告2025年前三个月山谷热病例急剧上升-《洛杉矶时报》 | California reports sharp rise in valley fever cases for first three months of 2025 - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQRVRZbGp5czhTenR5RzQ1RlFvVGg5ODc1ZTd4TVd0dks1dkNwVHlHUFI3TENUXy1sOW81NjI1UEdla09leE9obmtPYkNIcU9RbWstT2VMTmVfbWFWWnVfd1ExWVdFaHFNNzRtd2NPYVEwcFoxTXN0QXVMQkVlM28xSlp0SEpFUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-body font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 text-primary-text-color clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;California is heading toward another record year for cases of valley fever, the disease caused by fungal spores linked to cycles of drought and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 3,123 reported cases of valley fever in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first three months of the year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to state health officials — roughly double the 10-year average for the first-quarter time period. Cases ranged from a low of 801 in 2016 to 3,011 last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with the fungus won’t experience symptoms, and their bodies will fight off the infection naturally. Those who do suffer symptoms however are often hard-pressed to recognize them, as they resemble the onset of COVID or the flu, further complicating efforts to address the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by inhaling spores of coccidioides, a fungal pathogen that thrives in the drier and dustier regions of the state. The fungus is released when the dry soil where it grows is disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We actually had sort of seen this coming, just based on the climate cycle of the last few years,” said George R. Thompson, a professor of medicine at the UC Davis School of Medicine and a specialist in invasive fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;has shown that patterns of drought and precipitation play important roles in the number of valley fever cases in California, said Doua Ge Yang, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Public Health. “When there are several years of drought in California, followed by a wet winter, and then a dry summer,” there are increases in valley fever cases for the following two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said 2023 typified such a scenario, and as predicted, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-27/valley-fever-cases-spike-in-california"&gt;2024 resulted in a record-high case count&lt;/a&gt;, with 12,637 cases recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Valley fever is on the rise in California,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the numbers for 2025 are so far higher than any previously recorded first quarter, Yang said health officials can’t predict whether it will remain a record year. She also noted that all the numbers from 2024 and 2025 are considered preliminary — and therefore demographic issues such as age, sex and race cannot yet be reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to patterns of rain and drought, research shows that other factors can play a role in incidents of valley fever — including soil disturbance, such as the kind accompanying construction activity, wild fires and even archaeological digs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction workers, firefighters and archaeologists working in the dry, arid regions of the state are at increased risk of getting the disease — especially as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/04/30/californias-population-is-increasing/" target="_blank"&gt;Californians move into these previously less inhabited regions of the state.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, at least 19 people who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-10-02/the-threat-of-valley-fever-is-growing-in-central-california"&gt;attended Lightning in a Bottle, a five-day music and art festival held at Buena Vista lake in Kern County&lt;/a&gt;, came down with the disease — including several who reported severe effects that  included pneumonia-like symptoms, rashes, headaches and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival’s organizers will be holding the event again this year at the same location. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.libfestival.org/dustmitigation" target="_blank"&gt;According to the festival website&lt;/a&gt;, organizers will try to reduce dust by applying water to the ground to keep it in place, adding artificial turf in front of the stages for dancing, and reducing the number of motorized vehicles used by staff around the site, and placing additional wood chips over heavy traffic areas to suppress dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most people clear the infection on their own, the true number of afflicted people is not known. If a person’s immune system is unable to clear the infection  and it is left untreated, it can cause death or permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment varies depending upon severity, but antifungal drugs, such as  fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox, Tolsura), are the most common medications used. However, they come with serious side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, dry skin, dry mouth and chapped lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While several Central and Southern California counties have seen recent increases in their case counts, Monterey’s numbers have ballooned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, there were 22 cases reported during the first quarter in the Central California county; this year, the number is 217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials said they began seeing a surge in November of last year, at which point they sent out &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.countyofmonterey.gov/Home/Components/News/News/11080/" target="_blank"&gt;a health advisory&lt;/a&gt; to local medical providers and clinics providing information about the disease and testing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monterey County spokeswoman Karen Smith said that many residents had experienced severe disease and delays in their treatment and diagnosis. She said rates were highest for people who live in the southern part of the county and in the largely agricultural Salinas Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the county encourages people to reduce their risk of getting the disease by avoiding breathing in dirt and dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, the UC Davis doctor and researcher, said there has been anecdotal evidence that the disease may be increasing in severity, and there are concerns that it may also have acquired some immunity to the common antifungal medicines used to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some theorize that the widespread use of antifungal chemicals on crops in areas where the fungus is endemic may be contributing to its resistance, but research on the topic is only just getting underway and answers so far are elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there’s a statewide effort looking into these issues, that includes participation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s public health department, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, and  Cal State Fresno and Cal State Bakersfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the disease for years had largely been sidelined in public health circles, as attention and funding was targeted at other pathogens that had wider and more severe impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hate to disparage that, but I think with limited resources, public health agencies do have to really prioritize certain pathogens,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:38:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQRVRZbGp5czhTenR5RzQ1RlFvVGg5ODc1ZTd4TVd0dks1dkNwVHlHUFI3TENUXy1sOW81NjI1UEdla09leE9obmtPYkNIcU9RbWstT2VMTmVfbWFWWnVfd1ExWVdFaHFNNzRtd2NPYVEwcFoxTXN0QXVMQkVlM28xSlp0SEpFUQ</guid></item><item><title>详细的性感和厌恶感觉地图揭示了女性如何体验性触摸- PsyPost | Detailed erogenous and aversive sensation maps reveal how women experience sexual touch - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPN2JqZ1JFSGJNUjRucmNCVG9RRHVFUXJQYktydjREU0t5M3hDc1FlRWZqUTRWLUdwWTE0ZlAzdzJ3UWJmNkJLVDFYR0JzRVlSODY2SXJKTXkxbUdZeFI2cDhxSlNuU2dwS3AxQUR3MGkzM1BHS0hEOUF0Q0U1YW82cVJISVlWSHFoQ1ZIVG5tbkhLYWtDdkh4enN4WEVVWko1Qk0zbFdIcEZfb2xzeVpHcDBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have created comprehensive maps of women’s erogenous and aversive zones, pinpointing exactly which areas of the vulva, vagina, and breasts contribute most to sexual pleasure—and which are often avoided. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdae143" target="_blank"&gt;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study offers new insights into sexual sensation and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to fill several gaps in the current scientific understanding of sexual sensation. Past research has often excluded people with vulvas, overlooked internal genital structures, or failed to quantify how important specific areas are to sexual pleasure. Additionally, there has been almost no systematic study of areas that individuals dislike having touched during sex—referred to in this research as aversive sensation zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, the research team created a detailed anatomical survey, approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board, that asked respondents to indicate which specific areas of the breasts, vulva, and vagina they found pleasurable or aversive during partnered sex. A total of 499 women completed the survey, but only the 441 who reported having had partnered sexual experience were included in the final analysis. Participants were between 18 and 83 years old, with an average age of 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using anatomically precise illustrations of both external and internal genital structures, respondents selected specific zones they found pleasurable during sex and rated how important each zone was to their overall sexual pleasure on a 10-point scale. For aversive zones, they indicated which body parts they disliked being touched and selected from a list of potential reasons, such as pain, oversensitivity, shame, or past negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequently selected erogenous areas were in the vulva, with 82% of respondents identifying at least one pleasurable zone in that region. The vaginal introitus, periurethral area, and glans clitoris were the top three choices. (The vaginal introitus is the external opening of the vagina, the periurethral area is the region immediately surrounding the urethral opening, and the glans clitoris is the visible, sensitive tip of the clitoris.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glans clitoris received the highest average importance rating of all areas in the study, with a score of 9 out of 10. This supports existing evidence that the clitoris plays a central role in sexual pleasure for many women, but the prominence of the vaginal introitus was an unexpected result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast tissue and nipples were also commonly cited as sources of pleasure. About 58% of participants identified breast tissue as an erogenous zone, while 43% selected the nipples. However, the nipples were also the most frequently selected aversive zone among the breast subareas. Reasons given for nipple aversion included oversensitivity and pain. Notably, younger women were more likely to report pleasure in breast zones, suggesting some age-related variation in sensitivity or preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses regarding the vagina highlighted the superficial anterior wall—often associated with the “G-spot”—as the most pleasurable area inside the vaginal canal. Nearly half of respondents selected this area, giving it a high average importance rating. Fewer people selected the cervix or deep vaginal walls, and these areas were more frequently flagged as aversive, primarily due to pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anus was the most frequently selected aversive zone in the entire study, with 34% of participants reporting that they disliked its stimulation during sex. While 12% did identify it as pleasurable, the overwhelming majority of negative responses reflected not only physical discomfort but also emotional responses such as shame or embarrassment. This pattern persisted across different age groups, suggesting that cultural stigma around anal contact remains prevalent despite its growing visibility in media and sex education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most results were consistent across demographic subgroups, age emerged as a meaningful variable. Younger respondents were more likely to identify a wider range of areas—across the breasts, vulva, and vagina—as pleasurable. This could reflect both generational differences in sexual norms and physiological differences related to hormonal changes. Many respondents were likely in perimenopause or menopause, a life stage known to impact genital sensation and libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer potential applications beyond academic research. Erogenous maps could help clinicians, therapists, and surgeons understand individual variability in sexual sensation, especially for people undergoing medical treatments or procedures that affect the genital area. For example, individuals recovering from cancer treatment, gender-affirming surgeries, or pelvic floor trauma may benefit from personalized sensation maps to monitor changes or tailor interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These maps also challenge conventional ideas about which body parts are considered “universally” pleasurable. For instance, while the glans clitoris is often highlighted in discussions about female sexual pleasure, this study suggests that other regions—like the vaginal introitus or the superficial anterior vaginal wall—are equally or even more significant for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aversive zone data provide insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of sexual experience. Pain and oversensitivity were the most common reasons for aversion across all areas. But when it came to the anus, feelings of disgust and shame were disproportionately high. These emotional responses underscore the need for more open, nonjudgmental conversations about sexuality, as well as individualized sexual health education that respects diverse experiences and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths—including a relatively large sample size and anatomically detailed illustrations—this study has limitations. Its retrospective and anonymous nature limited the amount of background information collected about participants. Only 62% of respondents had engaged in sexual activity within the year prior to the survey, which means that some data relied on recollections of older experiences. The survey also excluded transgender and gender-diverse individuals, so its findings cannot be generalized to all people with vulvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on this study by including more diverse populations and tracking changes in sensation over time. For example, it would be useful to examine how erogenous and aversive zones shift after hormonal changes, medical treatments, or use of specific sexual health interventions such as pelvic floor therapy or vibratory stimulation. Studies could also investigate neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize sensory maps—and how this might affect sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study,  “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/22/1/7/7905380?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Anatomic maps of erogenous and aversive sensation zones of the breasts, vulva, and vagina: A questionnaire-based study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jenna Stelmar, Michael Zaliznyak, Sandeep Sandhu, Dylan Isaacson, Erin Duralde, Shannon M.

But eating that much chicken may not be as healthy as once thought, according to a recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the study, researchers investigated the connection between poultry consumption, gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/04/24/cancer-prevention-progress-setback/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and early death. Poultry refers to all forms of birds, including chicken, turkey, duck, and game birds like quail and pheasants. Examining data from 4,869 middle-aged Italian participants over 19 years, who answered surveys about their food and beverage consumption, researchers found that white meat consumption (rabbit and poultry) was highest among those who died of gastrointestinal cancers—&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/childhood-exposure-bacteria-colorectal-cancer-rates-millennials-gen-xers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;, liver, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and rectal cancer, for example—with poultry intake accounting for 33% of their white meat intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who consumed over 300 grams of poultry per week—about 3.5 three-ounce servings—had a 27% higher mortality rate from all causes. For men in particular, that rate jumped to 61%. For gastrointestinal cancer specifically, they found that consuming 100 to 200 grams of poultry per week was associated with a 65% increased risk of death from gastrointestinal cancer compared to other cancers, while participants who consumed over 300 grams of poultry every week were 127% more likely to die from gastrointestinal cancer, with this risk even greater at 161% for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much chicken should you eat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the study, the less poultry consumed the better. While the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends that adults should eat 26 ounces per week of lean meat and poultry (in a 2,000-calorie diet), following the study’s guidance of less than 300 grams per week would mean consuming no more than 10.5 ounces of chicken per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our results show that consumption of more than 100 grams per week of poultry was associated with an increased risk of death both from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancer,” the study authors wrote. As poultry consumption increased, so did mortality risk—and the results were even more pronounced for those who consumed higher portions of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study participants, who at age 83, consumed less than 100 grams of poultry per week had half the mortality risk from gastrointestinal cancer than those who consumed more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers also suggested that the way chicken is cooked may affect how it impacts your health. White meat cooked at higher temperatures—like grilling or barbecuing—or for long periods in a stew could form high levels of agents that cause genetic mutation, which could influence the development of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to overall meat consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers found that overall meat consumption plays a substantial role in mortality risk—even when following one of the most recommended diets for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants who died of non-gastrointestinal cancers had diets where red meat accounted for over 65% of their total meat intake, as compared to 56% and 58% among those who died of gastrointestinal cancers and other causes, respectively. Over half of cancer-related deaths occurred in people who consumed over 400 grams of meat every week—even when on the &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/04/14/mediterranean-diet-heath-benefits-science/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe it is beneficial to moderate poultry consumption, alternating it with other equally valuable protein sources, such as fish,” the authors wrote. “We also believe it is essential to focus more on cooking methods, avoiding high temperatures and prolonged cooking times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more on diet and health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/chicken-per-week-mortality-cancer-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNd2xVaGw1dGhkemtTakpzUU1IOHJLcmloYktwQmZlMHF6R01hblZENi1jTldPNjVESU1HMkJjVV9rY2lVQ2VYOEtrZF83T1hKZUp3UkZPOG5FSWVFdXotMm9QTFFDaHdGX2FpSDh5Vzh5eXR4aU05R210M0hEd0xhM29Ic2h5OXdIOENkUlNB</guid></item><item><title>研究人员警告说，每周吃这么多鸡肉可能会增加死亡风险-财富 | Researchers warn that eating this amount of chicken per week could increase your mortality risk - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBkb3h1Q0tXSVJ6ZGlaNGZQZU5OVnFmM041SzBjODh0Wms3M3M2dXUwY2dPb2tQSVRJdUNGZllkdU80ZW14S05iM0NFeEZMOVhCYWdidTQ0WFBtUElPTjFIRHhfZE11SmQzNDd0WjUyV2JQZEJOdGZXZnNxb20?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBkb3h1Q0tXSVJ6ZGlaNGZQZU5OVnFmM041SzBjODh0Wms3M3M2dXUwY2dPb2tQSVRJdUNGZllkdU80ZW14S05iM0NFeEZMOVhCYWdidTQ0WFBtUElPTjFIRHhfZE11SmQzNDd0WjUyV2JQZEJOdGZXZnNxb20</guid></item><item><title>美国有近900例麻疹病例。以下是您需要了解的信息- ABC新闻 | There are nearly 900 measles cases in the US.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first item to add to your grocery list is apples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He reveals that apples - which have around 95 calories per fruit - have something called chlorogenic acid inside their flesh,  which 'turns on your brown fat' to burn down your white fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review of the health benefits of apples conducted by food scientists at Cornell University also praises the fruit as a weight loss aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reviewing research, they concluded: 'Based on these epidemiological studies, it appears that apples may play a large role in reducing the risk of a wide variety of chronic disease and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Of the papers reviewed, apples were most consistently associated with reduced risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma, and type II diabetes when compared to other fruits and vegetables and other sources of flavonoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Apple consumption was also positively associated with increased lung function and increased weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li's second and third food recommendations to slim down are broccoli and kale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These contain a phytochemical called sulforaphane, which also helps to activate brown fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also low in calories, with both providing around 30 calories per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of the food expert's favorite foods to promote weight loss is bok choy, due to its low calorie content, high fiber and nutrient density&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert's fourth favorite food to promote weight loss is bok choy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to its low calorie content (just 9 calories per cup), high fiber and nutrient density, Di Li says it is a great vegetable for dieters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber helps maintain a healthy weight, as it makes you feel fuller for longer and therefore reduces the likelihood of overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on the best way to prepare the bok choy, he says: 'You cut off the bottoms, you wash the leaves, take a wok or a skillet, a little extra virgin olive oil, a little garlic, [and] sauté that up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights that instead of butter, he recommends using olive oil, with this being his fifth fat-reducing superfood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it is calorie-rich - with around 120 calories per tablespoon - it provides numerous health benefits due to its nutritional content, especially extra virgin olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two ingredients Di Li points to in olive oil for their health boosting properties are hydroxytyrosol and oleocanthal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest hydroxytyrosol can increase fatty acid oxidation, potentially boosting the body's ability to burn fat, and it may also help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity, further contributing to weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, studies have shown oleocanthal may contribute to weight loss and improved heart health due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It reduces inflammation in a way similar to ibuprofen, by blocking inflammatory enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li concludes: 'Now you actually have the greens and the olive oil, that will trigger your brown fat to turn it down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:32:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZmFkTkN4MUtzbERXOXdDYVVkd25uX2N0VmdhZjRfdS1iU2RWZmJpVGVISWFNZWZ6SXExQmpoRHdFU0lyRk5rUXZrdG1NVFZXaEktcGZHYnZ3cFRQeThWTFNESU0zV1RkaGpyelBFUWlNR0pJTF9UWDVHZ1NidGRaWlpNSXN4R3dWUEkwTmVTRjlCUFR2Q1ZrVTlGUVR5M1Vwcmo00gGoAUFVX3lxTE93eXRKeHJYSDhPQVhULUN1OEdPdzNydTVkWTd3UkMxR3RvdVp0clVBVjhreFpzdjVkaUFXaEtWcGllaGlmS0tsN19pZk9BUGdyckxEM1VBNDF3cnJ3VzhpRW5MUzZpc0Z6YnkxbWlkcGhsV01pZnhwdFdWdTRsM3VLQW4tcEZhRldoNVFQNW9EcGw0Y3ZCUGJUYXdDNGxqRHZoRFRpWTBkZw</guid></item><item><title>病毒性韩国饮食有望在短短4周内快速减肥。以下是它的运作方式-《印度斯坦时报》 | Viral Korean diet promises rapid fat loss in just 4 weeks.

In the next four days, participants may consume fish, chicken, pork, eggs, or low-fat beef, while flour, dairy, and coffee aren't permitted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Week 2 - Intermittent Fasting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second week, participants are required to fast for one day for 24 hours. The fast should be broken with a high-protein dinner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next set of food intake includes a daily lineup of two protein shakes, low-carb meals including rice, vegetables for lunch, and a no-carb dinner, high protein dinner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuts, white rice, legumes, and a cup of black coffee. As muscle recovery is the main aim, high-intensity workouts are to be avoided on fast days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Weeks 3 and 4 - Emphasise Fat burn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks involve extended fasting periods to enhance fat burn. In Week 3, two non-consecutive 24-hour fasting periods are to be followed, and in the fourth week, three are required. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two shakes a day and two low-carb meals, including pumpkins, cherry tomatoes, chestnuts, and berries, are to be consumed. However, carb-dense foods like sweet potatoes and bananas are good for post-exercise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Maintenance &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the program is finished, participants must maintain their results with a 24-hour fast and a 14-hour fast window once a week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:28:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5gFBVV95cUxOM3RJQzJ2UlBfOTZ3eWE3d3FUVEFONGNHU0ZuZkc4UlNhOEZNNjVQQmpjSnZKTmUtNnF5dlBVczRDNzNRaUFoeG1GOGdVdkgxRjJGR1ZQYjFmOFFMSEFtUmhTYUJDVGZNUjNGNUJSRnlDUDJqZnZmOXhVV0lzaFJMbzl0SXZZRmFuM2lpNnhGU0prcFRYZ09DTUVkb1RsYTVBS2dzcDhCd0ROeU8xM2N0R2NPOU5PMnc3eVFRNC1xeWVXMTVwQzlnTFdNYmNBMl91Yi10UGJ0d3JGeTlxOGVnb2I0S2p2dw</guid></item><item><title>这种新物质可能有一天会阻断IBS和哮喘等严重炎症反应- Gizmodo | This Novel Substance Might One Day Block Severe Inflammatory Reactions Like IBS and Asthma - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxPeEt1ZzNreU14aWtqOVFWYVF1VDNCMTdFdG44UjVLNGRkeWlwZ2Qxc284SHQzeTBwNzJqNVQtVnFkOEQ3RklMOHFSZ1FoRW5GQ2lpbTZfdTdBOWx5Y2w2a1U4dV9uWjZ4bmFKUHpfTk9QY2hwcGJLQlRpdTJLTk1rRE96S2dFWExuQ3dNekJCWFRmRU5iNWJhY2l2ZmFPMlFtcXMxbF8xSHQzbjZobEN1LTFwRTU2a0dzR1N2X2dB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mast-cells"&gt;Mast cells&lt;/a&gt; are part of our immune system, protecting our body from viruses, bacteria, and even harmful substances released by snake and insect bites. When alerted to the presence of such invaders, mast cells can create mucus, trigger swelling and itching, and make muscles contract in our airways, stomach, and intestines. While these symptoms allow the body to destroy or expel invaders, oversensitive mast cells cause allergic reactions, including life-threatening and hard-to-treat conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02209-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, researchers have developed a compound that blocks mast cells from triggering particularly hard-to-treat and sometimes life-threatening reactions. These include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, chronic itching, and migraines. Traditionally considered pseudo-allergic reactions, these conditions have more recently been classified as a type of allergy, according to the researchers. The compound seems to greatly reduce symptoms, and as a consequence, lower fatality risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We thus see this as an extremely promising substance,” Christa Müller, a co-author of the study who researches medicinal chemistry of membrane proteins at the University of Bonn, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/072-2025"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unlike some allergic reactions, in which immune cells called antibodies alert mast cells to the presence of invaders, these hard-to-treat conditions occur when mast cells are triggered through direct activation not involving antibodies. This triggers reactions “of a specific nature that have been difficult to treat, and remain so to this day,” Müller explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;15 years ago, Müller and colleagues identified a receptor named MRGPRX2 in the mast cells’ membrane that “switches on” these sorts of reactions when &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-signaling-14047077/#:~:text=Conclusion,farther%20to%20reach%20their%20targets."&gt;certain molecules&lt;/a&gt; attach to it. “To prevent this reaction, the switch would have to be blocked somehow,” Müller continued. “The question was: how?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address this, the team tested promising compounds from a collection of 40,000 previously gathered by Müller’s department. “We used cells that light up when MRGPRX2 is activated, so we could then test whether the substances effectively block activation of the receptor, switching off the light signal,” explained Ghazl Al Hamwi, Müller’s doctoral student and first author of the study. In this way, the team discovered a molecule that can attach to the receptor and block it, effectively switching it off.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They used that molecule to develop a substance that still works in very low doses, and proved its efficacy at eliminating life-threatening allergic reactions in lab mice and blocking the MRGPRX2 receptor on isolated human mast cells. They also claimed the molecule only blocks the intended receptor, which avoids the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Al Hamwi, Müller, and their colleagues have since improved the substance’s efficacy and duration, more animal and eventually human trials will have to take place before it can be approved and commercialized as a drug. Nevertheless, it holds potentially life-saving implications for patients with some inflammatory conditions and those at risk of anaphylactic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

She also developed anemia - a lack of healthy red blood cells - and suffered episodes of sudden urgency to rush to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peters gave birth to two more sons in that five-year timeframe, rapidly losing large amounts of blood during her youngest son's birth. Soon after, the blood loss caused Peters to see a gastroenterologist that became 'shocked and concerned' after hearing her symptoms. The doctor referred her for a stool test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test came back positive for colon cancer markers, and a colonoscopy soon revealed a pomegranate-sized tumor in her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a series of further scans, Peters, then 39, was diagnosed with stage three rectal cancer in summer 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Peters, pictured here with her husband and three sons, is now cancer free and focused on spreading awareness of early-onset colorectal cancer with her organization Be Seen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peters, now 43 and a nonprofit founder, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/moms-rectal-cancer-signs-dismissed-5-years-diagnosis-rcna202770"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;: 'Life immediately turned upside down overnight as it does for anybody when they get life [changing] news like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer had been the furthest thing from my mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peters' cancer is considered early-onset, referring to cases in people under 50, which are on the rise in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest data shows early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 1999 to 2018, the rate of colon cancer in people under 50 increased from 8.6 cases per 100,000 to 13 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14623503/common-healthy-superfood-cancer-link-surge-rates.html"&gt;diets of ultra-processed foods, lack of exercise and being sedentary &lt;/a&gt;have all been blamed, along with environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, a study from the University of California San Diego suggested &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639343/breakthrough-scientists-pinpoint-colon-cancer-cause-young-people-url.html"&gt;childhood exposure to toxins produced by E. coli&lt;/a&gt; may set the stage for colon cancer later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include blood in the stool and abdominal pain, which are most often caused by more benign conditions like hemorrhoids, leading many doctors to not suspect colon cancer at first - such as in Peters' case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now believe her sudden bowel urgency came from the tumor sitting at the bottom of her rectum, the last part of the large intestine that connects the colon to the anus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marisa Peters, pictured here, was diagnosed with stage three rectal cancer at age 39 after more than five years of doctors brushing off her symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peters underwent 28 rounds of radiation with oral chemotherapy every weekday for five and a half weeks. She then had a seven-hour surgery to remove the mass and reconstruct her rectum, followed by another six rounds of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'That is when I feel like the real battle started because you realize what has gone on in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thankfully, gratefully, miraculously I had a complete response to treatment.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peters is now cancer free and focusing on advocacy work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after completing treatments, she started the nonprofit &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://beseen.care/"&gt;Be Seen&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to 'eradicate death by young onset colorectal cancer' through three pillars: awareness, access and research and taking action, such as with a stool test or colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peters said: 'I’m never going to stop talking about this. If I can help humanize and make this more realistic by sharing my own story, as improper or unglamorous... as it might be, I am never going to stop sharing that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that dream recall is most strongly influenced by a person’s attitude toward dreams, their tendency to mind-wander, and specific sleep characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who value dreams more, daydream frequently, and experience longer sleep with less deep sleep are more likely to remember their dreams. These findings underscore the complex relationship between sleep, memory, and our waking thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Valuing dreams is linked to more frequent recall, though not necessarily better content memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Wandering Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Frequent daydreamers tend to recall dreams more often, suggesting a shared mental process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Pattern Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Longer sleep duration with less deep sleep boosts dream recall; winter months see lower recall rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although almost everyone dreams, the ability to recall these experiences varies significantly between individuals. Research has sought to better understand this phenomenon by analysing the factors influencing dream recall. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that three main factors determine whether a person will remember their dream upon waking: attitude towards dreams, tendency to mind wandering, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams can be defined as subjective conscious experiences generated by our brain during sleep when we are significantly (although not totally) disconnected from the external environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dream experiences draw on previously acquired memories and beliefs and therefore have relevant aspects of continuity with the thoughts, concerns, and salient experiences of our waking self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientific evidence suggests that most people dream during sleep and do so for a large part of the night, dream recall already seems to show large interindividual variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several studies have indicated female gender, younger age, a positive attitude towards dreaming, frequent daydreaming, and fantasy proneness as factors associated with a higher dream recall frequency, other investigations produced partially inconsistent or even contradictory results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the support of the BIAL Foundation, Giulio Bernardi (IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy) coordinated a study that sought to better understand this phenomenon by analysing the factors that influence dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the team used a multimodal database that collected, between 2020 and 2024, dream reports, personal characteristics, and cognitive, psychometric, and neurophysiological measures in 217 healthy adults (18-70 years old, 116 females, 101 males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article The individual determinants of morning dream recall, published in February in the journal &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology,&lt;/em&gt; revealed the results of the research, pointing to three main factors that determine whether a person wakes up with the memory of the dream experience: the attitude towards dreams, the tendency to mind wandering, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding attitude towards dreams, the results indicate that people who attribute greater significance to dreaming are more likely to report the experience of dreaming upon waking, but this heightened interest does not necessarily enhance their ability to remember the content of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of note, although frequent dream recall may foster an interest in the meaning or significance of dreams, the direction of causality remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tendency to mind wandering emerges in this study as a robust positive predictor of dream recall. The association between mind wandering, so-called ‘daydreaming’, and observed dream recall may indicate a greater propensity to spontaneously generate dream-like experiences, regardless of external stimuli and vigilance states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that dream recall seems to be influenced by sleep patterns, i.e., individuals who typically have long sleep episodes, coupled with a low proportion of deep sleep, show a greater probability of dream recall compared to those experiencing shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon also shows seasonal fluctuations, with dream recall typically being lower during Winter than during Spring and Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these factors, individual differences in the ability to recall dream content depend on vulnerability to interference and age. Ageing can be associated with changes in sleep patterns – particularly a decrease in long and light sleep periods – which can affect dream recall processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces the idea that dreams are shaped by inter- and intra-individual factors, which opens up new perspectives for understanding their connection with memory and the human mind”, says Giulio Bernardi, emphasising that “the study of dreams is essential as it is known that they play an essential role in learning, in the memory consolidation and even in our mental and physical health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dream recall and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fundacaobial.com/com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fundacaobial.com/com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Giulio Bernardi – BIAL Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00191-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/a&gt;” by Giulio Bernardi et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night. Yet, dream recall shows large interindividual variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the factors that influence dream recall is crucial for advancing our knowledge regarding dreams’ origin, significance, and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we tackled this issue by prospectively collecting dream reports along with demographic information and psychometric, cognitive, actigraphic, and electroencephalographic measures in 217 healthy adults (18–70 y, 116 female participants, 101 male participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that attitude towards dreaming, proneness to mind wandering, and sleep patterns are associated with the probability of reporting a dream upon morning awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of recalling dream content was predicted by age and vulnerability to interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, dream recall appeared to be influenced by night-by-night changes in sleep patterns and showed seasonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results provide an account for previous observations regarding inter- and intra-individual variability in morning dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:18:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE00ZUdHbzJIMjFMSjhCbzFlNnpHZVVmbHZ5ZXdnRThSQUs5LWFrTW5vZEd6WDlFamNBdkRUSWdpM0N2VFNkRkhHd283c2RWbWRBU3gta0Z0RFl1N0taeko0M3dxT19Va2tqUDJCVWdn</guid></item><item><title>为什么我们的腰围在中年干细胞中扩展到过度驱动- Medical Xpress | Why our waistlines expand in middle age—aging stem cells shift into overdrive - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNQnNza1FIUXRxSjAycGFqVFAybGZBTjYwclBGaGlJUmt0V1Yyallhck54ZWJDc3B6OXlsdHJXVGdVR0M5bEVOWFBmek1yMXhldUIwX3NKazNJcHBGVUU3eDBfQWFBYTY3am9xUmtUY052U18wVUxWdzRPQXV6QzF4Vmpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that our waistlines often expand in middle age, but the problem isn't strictly cosmetic. Belly fat accelerates aging and slows down metabolism, increasing our risk for developing diabetes, heart problems and other chronic diseases. Exactly how age transforms a six pack into a softer stomach, however, is murky.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Now preclinical research by City of Hope has uncovered the cellular culprit behind age-related abdominal fat, providing new insights into why our midsections widen with middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj0430" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, the findings suggest a novel target for future therapies to prevent belly flab and extend our healthy lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age—even when their body weight remains the same," said Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., the study's co-corresponding author and an associate professor of molecular and cellular endocrinology at City of Hope's Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We discovered aging triggers the arrival of a new type of adult stem cell and enhances the body's massive production of new fat cells, especially around the belly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the UCLA laboratory co-corresponding author Xia Yang, Ph.D., the scientists conducted a series of mouse experiments later validated on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt;. Wang and her colleagues focused on white adipose tissue (WAT), the fatty tissue responsible for age-related weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's well-known that fat cells grow larger with age, the scientists suspected that WAT also expanded by producing new fat cells, meaning it may have an unlimited potential to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The City of Hope team first transplanted APCs from young and older &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; into a second group of young mice. The APCs from the older animals rapidly generated a colossal amount of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the team transplanted APCs from young mice into the older mice, however, the stem cells did not manufacture many new fat cells. The results confirmed that older APCs are equipped to independently make new fat cells, regardless of their host's age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the scientists next compared APC gene activity in young and older mice. While barely active in young mice, APCs woke up with a vengeance in middle-aged mice and began pumping out new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While most adult stem cells' capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs—aging unlocks these cells' power to evolve and spread," said Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., the Ruth B. &amp;amp; Robert K. Lanman Endowed Chair in Gene Regulation &amp;amp; Drug Discovery Research and chair of the Department of Molecular &amp;amp; Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope. "This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs' high output of new fat cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging also transformed the APCs into a new type of stem cell called committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). Arising in middle age, CP-A cells actively churn out new fat cells, explaining why older mice gain more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/signaling+pathway/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;signaling pathway&lt;/a&gt; called leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) proved critical for promoting these CP-A cells to multiply and evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We discovered that the body's fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don't require this signal to make fat, older mice do," explained Wang. "Our research indicates that LIFR plays a crucial role in triggering CP-As to create new fat cells and expand &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/belly+fat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; in older mice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing on samples from people of various ages, Wang and her colleagues next studied APCs from human tissue in the lab. Again, the team also identified similar CP-A cells that had an increased number in middle-aged people's tissue. Their discovery also illustrates that CP-As in humans have high capacity in creating new &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fat+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fat cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity," said Wang. "Understanding the role of CP-As in metabolic disorders and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on tracking CP-A cells in animal models, observing CP-A cells in humans and developing new strategies that eliminate or block the cells to prevent age-related fat gain.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A common bacteria in our gut might be stirring up more trouble than we knew. A study out this week has found evidence that a mutagenic toxin produced by some strains of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; can trigger early onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Diego led the research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. They found a link between exposure to the toxin, called colibactin, and colorectal cancers more likely to happen in young adults. The findings could help explain why the rate of early onset colorectal cancer has mysteriously risen in recent years, though more research is needed to confirm a causative connection, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer, with roughly 150,000 Americans diagnosed with it every year. It’s also the second most leading cause of death by cancer, killing around 50,000 Americans annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with many types of cancer, the incidence and death rate of colorectal cancer has been steadily declining over time. However, this decline isn’t equally distributed, since the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing in young and middle-aged adults. According to the American Cancer Society, rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50 have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; by 2.4% per year between 2012 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t sure why these cancers have become more common in younger Americans, though some research has pointed the finger at &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/colorectal-cancer-in-young-people#:~:text=Sedentary%20lifestyle%2C%20overweight%20and%20obesity%2C%20smoking%2C%20heavy%20alcohol%20use%2C%20low%2Dfiber%2C%20high%2Dfat%20diets%20or%20diets%20high%20in%20processed%20meats%2C%20and%20other%20environmental%20factors%20have%20all%20been%20associated%20with%20the%20disease"&gt;processed foods, higher obesity rates, and other lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt;. But this new study appears to add another suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers weren’t specifically looking to unravel this mystery; they were more interested in understanding why some parts of the world have higher reported rates of colorectal cancer than others. To do so, they analyzed the genetic signature of colorectal cancers taken from nearly 1,000 people across the world. These samples included people with both late and early onset cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colibactin is already known to cause mutations in our cells that could raise the risk of cancer, and past studies have linked it to colorectal cancer. But the researchers were surprised to find that colibactin-related mutations were about three times more commonly found in the early onset cancers they studied compared to the late onset cancers. They also found molecular evidence that these colibactin-related mutations tend to show up early in a tumor’s development, suggesting they play a vital role in fueling these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Coupled with other research showing that colibactin-related mutations often appear in the first ten years of life, the authors argue that this toxin could be a major instigator of early onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease,” said senior study author Ludmil Alexandrov, a researchers specializing in cancer genomics at UC San Diego, in a &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that colibactin may still only be one big piece of a larger puzzle. They note that colibactin-related mutations were rarely found in more rural parts of the world. So it’s possible that other environmental factors like diet or antibiotic use are encouraging the growth of colibactin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in the gut in places like the U.S. Outside of colibactin, there might be other exposures that could explain higher cancer rates in different countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the team’s findings do provide fertile ground for future research, and could possibly even lead to interventions that could slow or reverse the rise in early onset colorectal cancer. The researchers are already hoping to study whether probiotics might be able to eliminate these more harmful &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;stains, and they’re trying to develop early detection tests that can screen for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All of this work, however, is contingent on further funding. And the researchers are quick to note that the U.S. government under President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/trump-100-days-nih-new-grants-cut/"&gt;aggressively limited funding&lt;/a&gt; from the National Institutes of Health in recent months—the same sort of funding that might go to important cancer research like theirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If NIH funding cuts impact our ability to do this work, that will be, in my opinion, a substantial hit to cancer research not just in the U.S., but globally,” said Alexandrov. “Our funding has allowed us to collaborate with cancer researchers around the world, collecting and analyzing large datasets from patient samples in multiple countries. That kind of scale is what makes discoveries like this possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Instead, results suggest aging patterns in spatial memory are similar regardless of neurodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable Memory Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Autistic traits did not predict faster decline in spatial working memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longitudinal Strength:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive ability remained stable over seven years for most participants, regardless of traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample Size &amp;amp; Scope:&lt;/strong&gt; Study analyzed data from over 10,000 adults aged 50+, making it the largest of its kind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no difference over time in the spatial working memory of older people who have autistic traits and those who are neurotypical, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published in &lt;em&gt;The Gerontologist&lt;/em&gt;, is the first study to explore age-related rate of decline in spatial working memory in older people who may be autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109145"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older lady and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research has indicated that there may be higher dementia rates in older adults with autism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial working memory helps people to remember and use information about where things are and how they are arranged. It is typically used for tasks that involve navigating spaces or organising objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people get older, spatial working memory can sometimes become less effective, which is an example of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline can be a part of normal aging, but it can also be more pronounced in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial working memory can also be affected in autistic people – especially when it comes to tasks that involve remembering and organising visual information. Consequently, there has previously been debate over whether autism may lead to increased risk of cognitive decline and, by extension, future dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the research team used data from 10,060 people over the age of 50 in the UK who had been assessed as having autistic traits – such as difficulty with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviours or interests – from the PROTECT study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that 1.5% of the cohort had high levels of autistic traits and may be autistic, which is comparable to prevalence estimates of autism in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analysed this data using a method called growth mixture modelling to see how participants’ spatial working memory changed over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study showed that most people, whether they had high levels of autistic traits or not, maintained their cognitive ability over time. This suggested that autistic people were not more likely to experience cognitive decline in this domain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author, Professor Joshua Stott (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences) said: “Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with differences in social communication and repetitive patterns of sensory motor behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is known that autistic people often also have cognitive differences relative to non-autistic people. In light of this and a current global World Health Organisation-led focus on prevention of cognitive decline and dementia, there has been considerable interest whether having a neurodevelopmental condition like autism can affect your risk of age-related cognitive decline, and potentially dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work provides no support for any difference between autistic people and neurotypical people in terms of increased risk of age related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there are limitations and more studies are needed, looking directly at other aspects of cognitive decline and dementia risk in community rather than healthcare records samples, this research provides useful evidence that can hopefully help to reassure autistic people about this concerning issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated that there may be higher dementia rates in older adults with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies, which look at healthcare records, are hindered by the very low diagnostic rate of autism in older people (around one in nine adults over the age of 50 are diagnosed in the UK) meaning that they only look at a very particular and small subsample of autistic people, who probably have more healthcare difficulties and consequently are at greater risk of dementia than autistic people in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other studies that support the theory that autism has no extra effect on cognitive decline have previously only looked at whether autistic people differ in cognition from non-autistic (neurotypical) people at a single time point – rather than tracking changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Dr Gavin Stewart, British Academy Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp;amp; Neuroscience at King’s College London, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how ageing intersects with autism is an important yet understudied topic. Getting older often comes with a range of changes, including in health and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As autistic people can be at greater risk of certain health problems and have cognitive differences to non-autistic people, we need to know whether autistic people will have different patterns of ageing than their non-autistic peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides some reassuring evidence that some aspects of cognition change similarly in autistic and non-autistic populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies should test people for a longer time and include a wider age range to understand memory changes better. These findings also need to be replicated in samples who meet diagnostic criteria for autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by the Dunhill Medical Trust, the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), Economic and Social Research Council (ERC), Alzheimer’s Research UK, and the British Academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study only included people who could use a computer and the internet, so it might not represent all older adults in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the test for autistic traits mainly looked at social and communication issues, not other autism-related behaviours, which might affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And most participants were white, so the findings might not apply to people from other ethnic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD and cognitive aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#77075903181a15043702141b59161459021c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaf096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The association between autism spectrum traits and age-related spatial working memory decline: a large-scale longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Stott et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The association between autism spectrum traits and age-related spatial working memory decline: a large-scale longitudinal study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on mixed findings from previous research, researchers have hypothesised autism may be a protective or risk factor for age-related cognitive decline/dementia, or that autism does not influence it (parallel ageing). To differentiate between hypotheses, longitudinal studies that account for autism underdiagnosis, are needed and lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined if higher autistic traits in adults aged 50+ are associated with a greater risk of spatial working memory (SWM) decline, a key cognitive domain affected in both healthy aging and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Design and Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants from the online PROTECT cohort (n = 13,390) were classified into three groups based on autism spectrum traits (AST): high (H-AST, n = 205), intermediate (I-AST, n = 589), and no traits (COA, n = 12,451). SWM performance was captured annually across 7 years. Growth mixture models (GMM) and latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were estimated to examine the relationship between AST and SWM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GMMs revealed an optimal 1-class quadratic solution, consistent across groups. There were no significant differences between AST groups in baseline SWM (&lt;em&gt;p = 0.837)&lt;/em&gt;. AST were not associated with SWM at baseline &lt;em&gt;(B = 0.01, SE = 0.05, p = 0.901)&lt;/em&gt; or SWM trajectory &lt;em&gt;(B = 0.00, SE = 0.01, p = 0.856)&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of accounting for covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion and Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest a single SWM trajectory in middle-aged/older adults with higher autistic traits and no autistic traits. Future research should address if these broader autism phenotype results are replicated in diagnosed autism groups.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:54:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5NR0ViMkRYSEFjTTRhcWRnYndOTWUyOXFiOVZmZWZHYklVX2tQalhWT2hfTHdHTmw5ME9uMHZCUlRoU2VzUXJ5Z2FYdlN6Wk5mNTRwdy1YZ1dmakRoZWVWNHhZVWYzUQ</guid></item><item><title>你眼中的微妙线索可能意味着你会在45岁时患上痴呆症-每日邮报 | The subtle clue in your EYE that could mean you'll get dementia as young as 45 - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPM1dlOHByWWZ5Ylpkb2RTelUwUkRNRG5JbngtZW92dnpudHRPZ0lVd1RBWFlFRXY0bHlGcUNJR2dDeXg1Ty1UM1RyakM0QzVVX0ZHenFtdTRjdFFEUmd3ZDJPY0J0YXp1WjJYLUxURmIyREwtaV96UWJ3MTV3ejBKOFlYZk9xeUQ4RGVER0JqcmRjSnZjLXVZMVNDTGZVQmVCQ1Zr0gGoAUFVX3lxTE5ScVB5VmR1SjB6Zl9QY0NsWnBrU0NuUDljaUVhMW9ITlFNOFJkRENUVmp2RlJmYWc3LTl2NmJaaWtaSEIzdWJiQm9NaDFWMDh4T25saXBFUkVYaThnMDlOcG91cmtEOFRsbV9KVE04VEZyNFR3YkljRUhoRWZScUZaNUdHRTlQRjJZQkt5TU9KYXFxNWVGc0Y2LWRCVXp2YUhXTzdmNDNkNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blurry vision and seeing spots could means you're at high risk of developing early-onset dementia, researchers have discovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_zealand/index.html" id="mol-414f5f30-21ea-11f0-9fa1-878caa005253"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; found that people were far more likely to be diagnosed with the disease in their 60s, 50s an even 40s if the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye was abnormally thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This problem is known medically as retinal thinning, and causes distorted vision which includes seeing spots, lines or flashing lights, as well as changes in colour perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia risk was also raised in those with signs of narrowing arteries and wider veins in the eye, which can cause pain or pressure as well as loss of vision in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the University of Otago, suggested that both problems suggest insufficient blood flow to both the eye and the brain, which could contribute to the development of the memory robbing condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added that it could also be a sign of poor circulation throughout the body, which is also a known risk factor for the disease, as well as heart attack and stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thorough eye examinations could therefore be a useful method of targetting those at risk of developing the disease, according to study author and psychology researcher Dr Ashleigh Barrett-Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis is considered critical for better outcomes as dementia treatments can combat symptoms and slow down progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The the obscure clue in your eye that could reveal you will get dementia as young as 45-years-old  all comes down to your blood vessel health and the thickness of your retina, researches from New Zealand have said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, experts analysed data from participants of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which recorded 45 years of health data from 900 New Zealanders with an average age of 45-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They combined photos and scans of participants’ retinas with cognitive tests designed to predict a person’s risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Assessments were carried out at birth and ages three, five, seven, nine, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, 38, and most recently at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed those with retinal thinning and poor eye blood vessel health were far more likely to show signs of cognitive decline aged 45 — often a precursor to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers advised that the imaging could be a simple and low-cost method of assessing dementia risk among middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However they warned the test could only show potential risk and is not a definitive diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed a measles outbreak in the state Friday. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health said there are six confirmed measles cases in the state. The Centers for Disease Control defines an outbreak as occurring when a virus spreads among three or more individuals who share a connection with each other. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Health, there are two cases in the mid-Cumberland region and four in the upper Cumberland region. All six patients were unvaccinated, according to the department. Four patients are between 5 to 17 years old, one patient is between the ages of 18 and 49, and the final patient is over 50 years old, according to the Department of Health's data.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case was confirmed on March 17. Three cases were confirmed between March 28 and March 31. The final two cases were confirmed on April 14. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are the first confirmed case of measles in the state since 2019, and it came amid multiple reported outbreaks across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Health, measles is a highly contagious viral infection that causes a red, blotchy rash. The virus usually affects babies and young children and can cause serious illness requiring hospitalization.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles usually occur between 7 and 14 days after infection. Those symptoms include rash, high fever, watery eyes, runny nose and dry cough. If you think you or your child was exposed or has symptoms, the Department of Health recommends isolating at home and contacting your healthcare provider.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine. Children should get their first dose between 12 and 15 months old. The second dose should be given between the ages of 4 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said&lt;/a&gt; that as of April 17, 800 confirmed cases had been reported so far this year across 25 jurisdictions, including Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Kentucky. It said there have been 10 outbreaks reported so far this year, and 94% of confirmed cases were associated with them. According to the CDC, 11% of this year's cases had to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;A former Vice Chancellor of the University of Health and Allied Sciences, Prof Fred Binka, has stated that Ghana has the potential to eliminate malaria with the right resources and commitment. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Prof Binka, the main challenge facing Ghana's malaria elimination efforts is the lack of financial resources to procure necessary commodities and implement the national malaria elimination plan.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The main challenge facing Ghana’s malaria elimination efforts is the lack of financial resources to procure necessary commodities and implement the national malaria elimination plan,” he said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He stressed the need to decentralise malaria interventions to the district levels, allowing for more targeted and effective efforts. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to a Ghanaian Times report on April 25, 2025, Prof Binka highlighted the importance of community engagements and participation in Ghana's malaria elimination efforts, urging individuals to contribute by sleeping under treated mosquito nets and seeking prompt treatment when symptoms arise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Speaking on the theme of the 2025 World Malaria Day celebration, 'Malaria Ends with Us: Reinvest, Reimagine, reignite,' Prof Binka said it was a clarion call to refocus on malaria and commit resources to eliminate the disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“With the right resources and commitment, Ghana can join the ranks of countries that have successfully eliminated malaria,” he indicated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
His remarks come as Ghana pursues its National Malaria Elimination Strategic Plan 2024-2028, aiming to reduce malaria deaths by 100% and cases by 50% by 2028. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ghana has made significant progress in reducing malaria deaths and parasite prevalence in recent years, and Prof Binka believes that with the right resources, the country can join the ranks of those that have successfully eliminated the disease. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ghana has, meanwhile, made significant progress regarding malaria control over the years. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For instance, deaths due to malaria have reduced from 2,799 in 2012 to 151 in 2022. Malaria prevalence has also declined from 27.5% in 2011 to 8.6% in 2022 while confirmed malaria cases per 1000 population has reduced from 192 in 2019 to 159 per 1000 in 2020. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Despite these achievements, malaria remains a significant public health problem in Ghana&lt;br&gt;

In a diverse group of participants aged 19 to 86, they found an inverted U-shaped pattern: LC signal peaked in late middle age, then declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a strong LC signal after age 60 was tied to better cognitive performance, while sharper peaks were observed in women and Black participants—groups disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s. These findings highlight the LC’s role in healthy aging and underscore the need for diverse research samples in brain health studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Spot Trajectory:&lt;/strong&gt; LC signal intensity peaks in late middle age, then declines with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher LC signal after age 60 correlates with better cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic Variation:&lt;/strong&gt; Black participants and women showed higher LC neuromelanin peaks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a demographically diverse sample of healthy people, Cornell researchers found dramatic changes over the human lifespan in the brain’s “blue spot” – a tiny region involved in cognition and believed to be the first affected by neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using specialized MRI scans to measure the intensity of neuromelanin, a pigment that gives the locus coeruleus (LC) its blue color, the research team observed an inverted U-shaped curve that peaked in later middle age before dropping off sharply, a finding that helps characterize healthy aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a stronger blue signal after age 60 was associated with better cognitive performance, according to the study involving 134 participants aged 19 to 86. Because of the participants’ diversity, including about 40% who were non-white, the researchers also discovered higher peaks among Black participants and women, groups known to be more susceptible to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By examining the health of the locus coeruleus and its relation to cognitive aging processes, these data may reveal when an individual is on a healthy aging trajectory and advance our understanding of why certain groups may have higher incidence of Alzheimer’s disease later in life,” said Adam Anderson, professor in the Department of Psychology and the College of Human Ecology (CHE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed underlying similarities in LC risk markers across the lifespan, but areas of specific concern for distinct demographic groups, especially for some that have been underrepresented in medical research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in “Age-related Differences in Locus Coeruleus Intensity Across a Demographically Diverse Sample,” published March 17 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cornell team included Anderson and Eve De Rosa, the Mibs Martin Follett Associate Professor in Human Ecology (CHE) and dean of faculty, who co-lead the Affect and Cognition Lab (ACLAB); Khena Swallow, associate professor in the Department of Psychology and the College of Arts and Sciences; and ACLAB members Elizabeth Riley, a research associate and the paper’s first author; Nicholas Cicero ’20; and Senegal Mabry, a doctoral student in the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located deep in the brainstem, the locus coeruleus is the primary source of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter crucial for attention, memory, stress responses and even sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought to be the brain region most vulnerable to Alzheimer’s pathology, potentially affected years or decades before symptoms show. Thus, a better understanding of normal and abnormal LC aging trajectories is considered crucial to earlier detection of such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans performed at the Cornell MRI Facility showed a consistent general pattern in healthy individuals’ LC signal intensity, regardless of education, income, and history of early trauma. Increased neuromelanin levels in midlife were associated with better cognition and decreases after age 60 with poorer cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research is exploring ways to help sustain healthy levels, potentially through practices such as deep breathing or stimulation of the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the two subgroups showed more dramatic peaks in LC neuromelanin intensity is unclear, but the researchers said they are consistent with a theory of compensation: Overtaxing one’s brain and stressful living, which involves the LC, could be beneficial in the short term but deplete function later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the locus coeruleus is required for alertness, focus and memory,” Anderson said, “heightened neuromelanin can also be a sign of overactivity and is implicated in depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, all of which are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s racial and socioeconomic diversity – key to the findings’ overall generalizability and specific insights about subgroups – was achieved through a collaboration with the Community Recruitment Research Accelerator, a project of SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project seeks to increase diverse community participation in brain health research, partnering with a community recruitment liaison to reduce barriers to participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study illustrates the importance of diverse samples in studying brain health,” Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diverse samples are necessary to generalize study results to the larger population, and a critical form of scientific validity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognitive aging and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2842494c1d1b1c684b475a464d4444064d4c5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;James Dean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;James Dean – Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2025.03.005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Age-related differences in locus coeruleus intensity across a demographically diverse sample&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Anderson et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-related differences in locus coeruleus intensity across a demographically diverse sample&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the trajectory of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; locus coeruleus (LC) signal intensity across the adult lifespan and among various demographic groups, particularly during middle age, may be crucial for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, which begin in the LC decades before symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though pathological changes in the LC are thought to begin in middle age, its characteristics across the adult lifespan, and its consistency and variation across demographic groups, remain not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using T1-weighted turbo spin echo magnetic resonance (MRI) scans to characterize the LC, we measured LC signal intensity in 134 participants aged 19–86 years, with an effort to recruit a more racially diverse sample (41 % non-White).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC signal intensity was lowest in early adulthood, peaked around age 60, and then decreased again in the oldest adults, particularly in the caudal portion of the LC, which exhibited the greatest overall signal intensity; education, income, and history of early trauma did not alter this general pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rostral LC signal intensity was further heightened in women and Black participants. In higher-performing older adults, increased rostral LC signal intensity was positively associated with higher fluid cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The potential accumulation of LC signal intensity across the adult lifespan and its possible dissipation in later life as well as its modification by demographic factors, may be associated with differential susceptibility to neurocognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:29:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1WMVM5aFoxeUFEODJoMjBObm9FYTJfVXo1YVQ1ZmFQQU9EVTFUMTAwcUt0c29CQ3VDVlVrdlhBaGlPT3V6RGkxZURVQUZJNmxNYnIyWEdSVDJUVFd0eGNfQTUtR0c</guid></item><item><title>科学家警告说，这种日常习惯可能会悄悄地缩小你的大脑- UNILAD | Scientists warn this one daily habit could be quietly shrinking your brain - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOU2cxQ2V5NnlNLS0xb1ZuVUt3bjU1c1drMF81ZnZmaERtRk9JSnRvNkw3bW84X25hNHU1b1JvelV4QWVjamFrV3hPX1BkclNaZE9LMFduUjFEcU5FNU5WVjI1ZE1URXlYNnNxa2lNLWJ1aFJ6T1B4ZHNmekdPeXF1Z1FRZGlrYTlMSGdiTXRYTnM1eTNaNXUtWk9Nc3dOZVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists all across the globe continue to attempt to understand the workings of the human brain, but a new study has delved into a potential cause of shrinking. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, before you start getting alarmed, the brain naturally starts to shrink in everyone and is a very normal process of ageing that isn't anything to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The atrophy of the brain, when it begins to waste away because of degeneration of the cells, tends to begin naturally in a person’s 30s and 40s. However, it can also be more pronounced due to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; issues with dementia and disorders like traumatic brain injury or strokes. With that said, a new study has found that there may be a common habit that is linked to brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;An University of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/california"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; San Francisco 2024 sleep study found that difficulties in sleeping appeared to contribute to atrophy of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Poor sleeping could be linked to brain shrinkage (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Explaining the study, that was &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209988"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a press release from the university stated: “To estimate the effects of sleep quality on the brain, the researchers surveyed approximately 600 adults on how well they slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The participants were asked the same questions five years later and underwent brain scans 10 years after this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"They found that even after adjusting for age, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;, education, health and lifestyle factors, the brains of those participants who slept poorly were more atrophied than those who slept well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Compared to the 70 percent of the sample who reported having little trouble sleeping, those with moderate difficulty (22 percent) had brains that were 1.6 years older, while those with the most difficulty (8 percent) had brains that were 2.6 years older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While a link has been established, previous studies have found similar results and called for more research into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The need for more research stems from not knowing whether sleep deprivation or having trouble falling asleep causes brains to shrink or whether it is the other way around, that people’s shrinking brains is causing them to sleep poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Scientists have called for more research into this topic so we can get a better understanding of cause and effect (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Clémence Cavaillès, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, commented on the conclusions from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She said: “While we can’t say that poor sleep causes dementia, earlier research has established an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Even if the cause of dementia is unrelated to sleep, it’s possible that poor sleep may advance or exacerbate cognitive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Senior author Kristine Yaffe, MD, of the UCSF departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Neurology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics also reiterated the importance of good sleep quality and argued this should be emphasized at younger ages to prevent potential brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:29:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOU2cxQ2V5NnlNLS0xb1ZuVUt3bjU1c1drMF81ZnZmaERtRk9JSnRvNkw3bW84X25hNHU1b1JvelV4QWVjamFrV3hPX1BkclNaZE9LMFduUjFEcU5FNU5WVjI1ZE1URXlYNnNxa2lNLWJ1aFJ6T1B4ZHNmekdPeXF1Z1FRZGlrYTlMSGdiTXRYTnM1eTNaNXUtWk9Nc3dOZVU</guid></item><item><title>减少异亮氨酸是延长33%寿命的关键- Earth.com | Reducing isoleucine is the key to a 33% longer life - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTGVQREtBd3ZvUXo1QkZ3S09xNW1WUlc3LVZBaVVIRlZfaTd5WmJsYXdRWGVLRFRMOGE1cmx4TWVVY3VIVG8tTVpGaGlXT3huMmx6UWxNNjBPN1pTb1ZpNXp5c2g2b2x4c1Y3SmVIalNrMW5hMlNOaXVtMDViNDA4dW1GNTI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle-aged mice lived 33% longer when they cut back on one particular dietary building block. This finding has grabbed attention because it suggests a simple strategy that may support &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/leg-balance-is-a-key-indicator-of-healthy-aging/"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work comes from research teams who tracked how limiting the isoleucine in rodent meals boosted their longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach was led by metabolism researcher &lt;a href="https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/directory/lamming_dudley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dudley Lamming&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Wisconsin, US, and colleagues who also observed improved blood sugar control and leaner physiques among the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isoleucine-s-role-in-healthy-aging"&gt;Isoleucine’s role in healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we’ve been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of,” explained Lamming, who was involved in these mouse experiments, in 2023. Isoleucine is an essential part of our diet, yet some people consume too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much of this amino acid has been linked to unhealthy weight gain. The mix of amino acids in a person’s diet is now seen as an important factor in metabolic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11185563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to increased body mass index in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isoleucine-restriction-extends-lifespan"&gt;Isoleucine restriction extends lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice on reduced-isoleucine chow experienced lifespan increases of about a third. They also handled glucose better and stayed slimmer even while allowed to eat more total calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting isoleucine did not require complicated food measurements. It simply involved changing the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-model-esm3-creates-new-protein-that-simulates-500-million-years-of-biological-evolution/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; proportions in their daily ration so that isoleucine was the limiting factor. The mice were allowed to eat freely, which makes the results even more surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-male-female-variation-in-isoleucine-restriction"&gt;Male-female variation in isoleucine restriction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, male mice showed a 33% boost in lifespan, while females only gained about 7%. This big gap raises questions about how sex hormones, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-metabolism-has-evolved-to-become-energetically-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and body composition may influence how the body responds to amino acid changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have seen similar patterns before with other nutrient-based interventions. Hormonal differences can affect fat storage, muscle metabolism, and how energy is used, which may explain why the same diet creates different results depending on sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-gains-from-limiting-isoleucine-intake"&gt;Health gains from limiting isoleucine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting and encouraging to think a dietary change could still make such a big difference,” said Lamming. Such results spark optimism for ways to support &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/experts-say-this-is-the-best-fruit-to-eat-for-a-healthier-liver/"&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt; aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe that trimming isoleucine intake helps the body regulate insulin activity, which in turn aids energy balance and metabolic stability. The 2021 study in mice supports the idea that altered amino acid levels can reprogram liver function and fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-and-rewards-of-isoleucine-reduction"&gt;Risks and rewards of isoleucine reduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts note that isoleucine is one of three branched-chain amino acids needed for survival, so eliminating it is not an option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Higher-protein foods&lt;/a&gt; like eggs, dairy, soy, and meats typically provide ample amounts of it, which can be troublesome for those at risk of excessive intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle adjustments must be approached carefully, because going too low in protein can also cause problems. “We can’t just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet,” Lamming said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incorporating-isoleucine-limited-foods-into-daily-meals"&gt;Incorporating isoleucine-limited foods into daily meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who eat mostly &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meat-protein-boosts-survival-but-plants-boost-longevity/"&gt;animal-based foods&lt;/a&gt; may be getting more isoleucine than they realize. Meats, dairy, and eggs are especially rich in branched-chain amino acids, including isoleucine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping some of these foods for plant-based proteins – like beans, lentils, or tofu – could be a practical way to bring levels down without under-eating protein altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about extreme dieting. It’s more about tweaking food choices to reduce excess. Since isoleucine is just one of many amino acids, small shifts in dietary sources might be enough to improve long-term health without sacrificing nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-in-isoleucine-focused-research-and-treatment"&gt;Next steps in isoleucine-focused research and treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe more targeted changes, including drugs that block how the body processes isoleucine, may one day be explored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers hope physicians and dietitians might soon personalize amino acid profiles for specific health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short-term trial &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27346343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that low-protein diets can reduce weight and improve metabolic markers even without cutting overall calories. Such findings hint that translating the rodent results to human benefits is not far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-prospects-for-isoleucine-and-healthy-aging"&gt;Future prospects for isoleucine and healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many see this approach as a clue about the intricate links between diet and aging. These rodent models give reason to think that certain dietary tweaks could support longevity in people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators emphasize that fine-tuning is key. They plan to keep studying how these food-based strategies could be adapted into safe recommendations for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any future guidance will need to balance nutrient needs, metabolic responses, and practical eating habits across different age groups and lifestyles.

A new study on psychedelic compounds might spark a deeper conversation about how the brain recovers from stress-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used mice to investigate how a single dose of a psychedelic compound can support cognitive flexibility. The lead investigator, Dr. Omar J. Ahmed from the &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/ojahmed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, oversaw an experiment that tested how the animals responded to unexpected &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psychedelics-sexuality-and-self-discovery-what-a-new-study-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-a-psychedelic-dose-rewires-the-brain"&gt;How a psychedelic dose rewires the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to reorganize and form new connections. Psychedelic drugs have shown promise in boosting these adaptive changes in certain parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has already &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671959/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; at benefits for people with depression and anxiety. This new investigation goes a step further by looking at how long these benefits last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts are exploring how &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1853/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;serotonin 2a receptor&lt;/a&gt; activation might reshape the way we learn. This receptor is linked to mood regulation and perception, so it makes sense that tweaking it could alter how the brain adapts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the investigators, only one dose was given to each mouse, with no additional treatments. Later, they ran tests that looked at how quickly the mice switched strategies under new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists say the prefrontal cortex is key to tasks that demand judgment and quick &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psychedelic-ibogaine-can-now-be-produced-without-rare-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. Strengthening its connections may explain why a single dose can produce effects that last far beyond the initial exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-psychedelic-dose-boosts-flexible-thinking"&gt;One psychedelic dose boosts flexible thinking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this discovery particularly significant is the sustained duration of cognitive benefits following just one psychedelic dose,” explained Professor Omar Ahmed. The researchers saw a clear advantage in how the psychedelic group tackled changing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female mice both showed an uptick in mental adaptability. This broad effect indicates that the underlying mechanism could benefit a wide range of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key question is what happens with two, three, or even twenty doses taken over several months,” said Dr. Ahmed. Investigators are curious about how repeated doses might affect flexibility in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such questions may guide the next phase of research. They might also help clarify whether more doses lead to better &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/increased-use-of-psilocybin-in-u-s-raises-health-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; or if there is a tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, not all psychedelics work the same way. Comparing substances with varying strengths and modes of action is essential to pinpoint which ones offer the most stable improvement in learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-mental-health"&gt;Implications for mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who deal with mood disorders struggle to cope with shifting demands. A boost in flexible thinking could help them adapt more quickly to life’s uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies that strengthen neuroplasticity show promise for conditions such as depression and PTSD. Psychedelics might become another avenue to support these neural changes, though more data from human studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6220878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that psilocybin, a well-known psychedelic, has produced lasting improvements in mental well-being. Researchers note that this effect can persist for weeks, hinting at a mechanism that goes beyond a short-term shift in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most striking aspect of our findings is that these cognitive benefits were measured 15-20 days after a single psychedelic administration,” noted Elizabeth J. Brouns. Experts are also excited about the possibility of helping older adults or those with conditions tied to memory decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD, in particular, involves disrupted patterns of recall that can get stuck in negative loops. Breaking these loops might involve a shift in how the brain processes threats and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-on-brain-healing"&gt;Future research on brain healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/confirmed-magic-mushrooms-can-effectively-treat-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt; about psychedelics might reshape how clinicians approach mental health. Some professionals predict that well-monitored psychedelic therapy could complement existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists plan to test different compounds, doses, and schedules to see what works best. They also want to confirm if these changes in flexibility come from changes in the prefrontal cortex or from other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since studies point to stable neuroplasticity shifts after just one dose, the timeline for integrating these treatments may be shorter than previously thought. At the same time, caution is key because not everyone responds the same way to psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before new guidelines become mainstream, rigorous research is needed to cover safety and efficacy. Investigators remain optimistic that single-dose therapies could one day make a difference for a variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal frameworks around psychedelics are evolving in the United States. These changes might eventually open paths for more clinical trials that evaluate safety and practicality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a fresh perspective on how one-time interventions may guide the future of mental health care. More thorough testing in clinical settings will reveal which populations stand to benefit the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/psychedelics/aop/article-10.61373-pp025r.0002/article-10.61373-pp025r.0002.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychedelics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:48:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQNFJjOU5BV3ZqZmZMMWR1ZnZYMU56aHJLSVFWemxyRElyNE1sSHQtY0ZUX2RJZlJqZGhZZk8zbnFFVER5NXMtT0E2NkNSdWk2T0JWUnk1S3QxeG1JMGZZZkhWaU8zaGlWSnFCQnJCQ2kwMmtGR0ozSFFIQ0d2dFZtX3hEbnE</guid></item><item><title>男人喝了几个月的蔓越莓汁，以为自己患有泌尿道感染，被诊断出患有晚期癌症-印度斯坦时报 | Man drank cranberry juice for months thinking he had UTI, diagnosed with terminal cancer - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPWWh0UWhkM0NjZ3VlR210d0xDajl1LWk2RmNXV2ViNEZjaFBJQkFVNjltX2xDVWdHSnVOb3QyWVdtdFdYekRzRGJyWHdGdjZCeWpwVlRlcVJkejNnM0NkZzA5VWNMV2NiSVpUUGRyc1hjNDk1dGdMYjVndEZncmZHdFA1MHU3UlBfYzFPR3QzTENuRGNlSE5hNmtYZXRzNGE3bWgwbkFoaG5JbnI0bmJqeDljd3hreDBWaW53bHJWSndMbFVfRVBnaV8wQnNQVkVZblJRSTUybVR4ZTdsbG5YQ3Rn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/trending/man-drank-cranberry-juice-for-months-thinking-he-had-uti-diagnosed-with-terminal-cancer-101745579954715.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A UK man revealed that after dismissing signs of an infection thinking it was a UTI, he was diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer.

He was prescribed antibiotics as well and soon after, his pain disappeared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, months later the pain came back and after multiple doctors were unable to find what was wrong, he decided to see a specialist. Tests concluded that he had muscle-invasive bladder cancer, where the tumour had grown into or through the muscle layer of the bladder wall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Given 2 years to live&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further scans showed that the cancer was at an advanced stage and he was given between a year and two years to live. After the shocking diagnosis, the father of two urged people not to dismiss early signs of the disease as an infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I went to the doctors, and explained what was going on, they took some urine samples and gave me some antibiotics. That seemed to work, it kind of went away for a while. A few months later, the pain came back, I did all sorts. I would drink cranberry juice, thinking that would flush through whatever was causing the pain, but that didn't have much of an effect," he recounted&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After doctors removed a 10cm tumour from his bladder, he was told that the cancer had spread to his pelvic lymph nodes and to a blood vessel near the bladder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Watch out for symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The oncologist said it was incurable. I asked what time frame we were looking at, it is a question that nobody wants to ask, and nobody wants to answer. She said that if we accept that the cancer is spreading, and other options don't work, I would be looking at 12 to 24 months. Our world changed overnight to a world of learning new things about cancer, hospital appointments and difficult conversations with family and friends," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He urged people to be on the lookout for symptoms like his and to not ignore them. Bladder cancer symptoms include bood in urine, more frequent and painful urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, incontinence and abdominal pain. It is linked to smoking and is three times more likely to occur in men than women.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:30:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPWWh0UWhkM0NjZ3VlR210d0xDajl1LWk2RmNXV2ViNEZjaFBJQkFVNjltX2xDVWdHSnVOb3QyWVdtdFdYekRzRGJyWHdGdjZCeWpwVlRlcVJkejNnM0NkZzA5VWNMV2NiSVpUUGRyc1hjNDk1dGdMYjVndEZncmZHdFA1MHU3UlBfYzFPR3QzTENuRGNlSE5hNmtYZXRzNGE3bWgwbkFoaG5JbnI0bmJqeDljd3hreDBWaW53bHJWSndMbFVfRVBnaV8wQnNQVkVZblJRSTUybVR4ZTdsbG5YQ3Rn</guid></item></channel></rss>
