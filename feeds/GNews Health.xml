&lt;h2&gt;Switching names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, the WHO decided to change the name. The United Nations health agency noted that it had received reports from individuals and countries about the "racist and stigmatizing language online, in other settings, and in some communities." The WHO decided to switch to the name "mpox" with a one-year grace period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also clarified its authority to make such a change, saying: "Assigning names to new and, very exceptionally, to existing diseases is the responsibility of WHO under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the WHO Family of International Health Related Classifications through a consultative process which includes WHO Member States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO does not, however, have the authority to change the names of viruses. That power belongs to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which has not changed the name of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the virus remains the same, the world has shifted to using mpox to discuss the disease. The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525134901/https:/www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/index.html"&gt;US CDC&lt;/a&gt; followed suit, changing its websites and health information to use the new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, however, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/index.html"&gt;reverted to monkeypox&lt;/a&gt;. The change was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/12/g-s1-88287/mpox-monkeypox-virus-stigma"&gt;first reported by NPR&lt;/a&gt;. When journalists have asked about the change, the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes the CDC) has responded only by saying "Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus," which is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT team proposed that a BEC of radioactive atoms—say, rubidium-83—could radioactively decay in sync to produce a laser beam. Neutrinos are released naturally during radioactive decay, and in the quantum BEC state, that decay should accelerate, an effect that should produce an amplified beam of neutrinos akin to how stimulated emission amplifies photons to produce a conventional laser beam. The next step is to build a tabletop demonstration of the concept. If that works, the team envisions using neutrino lasers as a new tool for underground communication and as a source of radioisotopes for medical imaging and cancer diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest forms of the pinhole camera have been around for millennia, dating as far back as the 4th century BCE in China. Light passes through a tiny hole punched into a light-proof box, projecting an inverted image of the scene outside onto the opposite interior wall. Lens-based imaging is prone to distortion and has limitations on depth of field and wavelength. So scientists have revived the pinhole technology to create a prototype pinhole camera for infrared imaging, according to &lt;a href="https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-12-9-1478&amp;amp;id=577004"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Optica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make their IR pinhole imaging system, the authors used a laser to create an optical hole inside a nonlinear crystal with a "chirped-period" structure capable of gathering light rays from a wide range of directions, resulting in a wider field of view. The crystal's unique optical properties essentially convert infrared images into visible light, making it possible for a standard silicon camera to record those images. The process also naturally suppresses noise, so it can work even in low-light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their prototype, the team used 3D time-of-flight IR imaging to image a matte ceramic rabbit and reconstruct its 3D shape by synchronizing ultrafast pulses. The IR pinhole camera can even be adapted to far-infrared or terahertz wavelengths. It's still very much in the proof-of-concept stage, but once their innovation makes IR imaging systems more affordable, portable, and energy-efficient, the authors envision applications in night vision, industrial quality control, and environmental monitoring, among other uses.&lt;/p&gt;

This can cause pain, muscle weakness, sensory problems, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We did a lot of physical therapy three times a week, and occupational therapy every week. It’s been a wild ride. He just started walking again in April of 2024 last year. He was walking again and quickly learned how to run,” Grover says. “Every three months we would go to Lehi, Utah, down to the new Primary Children’s Clinic, which is incredible, to get Botox shots in his joints to keep him from stiffening up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even through the rollercoaster of health setbacks, Grover says Carter is a loving, funny, and energetic kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Carter is just so happy to be alive. He’s got a little attitude of course, but who doesn’t these days? He loves dancing, he loves music, he loves all animals,” Grover says. “He’s just so playful and happy, and he always needs to be right there with me in everything that I do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 22, Carter’s grandmother, Laurie Peterson, was driving him to his physical therapy appointment, which he goes to three times a week in Rexburg, when she suffered a medical emergency while driving near the intersection on Salem Road at 3000 North. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/09/road-closed-as-officials-investigate-three-vehicle-crash-involving-tractor-in-rexburg/"&gt;RELATED | Road closed as officials investigate three-vehicle crash involving tractor in Rexburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson.jpg" alt="Laurie Peterson and Carter Grover during Carter's first appointment at Primary Children's Hospital. | Courtesy Katherine Grover" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781359" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-750x500.jpg 750w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Laurie Peterson and Carter Grover during Carter’s first appointment at Primary Children’s Hospital. | Courtesy Katherine Grover&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“She suffered a stroke that led to her being unable to stop properly at the stop sign and was hit by another oncoming vehicle. It did, unfortunately, involve a hay-baler,” Grover says. “We do feel like the vehicle rolled, but we aren’t sure. They were both wearing seatbelts at the time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six people were transported to the hospital, including Carter and his grandmother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grover was at Costco when she received the call from law enforcement, learning that her mother and son had been in a serious car crash and were both unconscious at the scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They were rushed to EIRMC in Idaho Falls, and somehow (Peterson) had become coherent enough to give them my name and phone number,” Grover says. “Shortly after that, she crashed and had to be intubated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly after being rushed to EIRMC, Carter was life-flighted to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The accident caused a spinal cord tear in the C1 and C2 of (Carter’s) spine, and his C5 and C6 were also damaged,” Grover explains. “Due to the severity of the spinal cord tear, it has left Carter paralyzed from the neck down, and he is unable to breathe on his own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Katherine, doctors have given Carter a difficult prognosis. Still, the family says they are choosing to keep hope alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The chances of him being able to walk again and breathe on his own again are pretty slim,” Grover says. “But, he is extremely cognizant of his brain. Activity is excellent, and he is awake, and he is communicating with me and the nurses and doctors with his eyes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family.jpg" alt="Carter Grover (left) with his grandmother, Laurie Peterson, brother William Grover, and mother, Katherine Grover. | Courtesy of Katherine Grover" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781360" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family.jpg 534w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family-267x300.jpg 267w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family-445x500.jpg 445w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;(Left to right) Carter Grover with his grandmother, Laurie Peterson, brother William Grover, and mother, Katherine Grover. | Courtesy of Katherine Grover&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Grover says she has been staying with Carter in Utah, while her sister, Emily Gonzales, has been with their mother, as she is in critical condition in the ICU at EIRMC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonzales says Peterson has suffered multiple strokes and is not “out of the woods yet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, she did suffer multiple strokes, and those were on the left side of her brain,” Gonzales says. “She’s got a long road of recovery as well. She has two broken collar bones, a fractured sternum, broken ribs, fractured pelvis, a laceration to her spleen, and two pneumothoraxes, so she’s got holes in each lung.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite all the challenges, the sisters say that the community’s support has been overwhelming, and they have been flooded with help from family and friends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am just so humbled and honored to have such amazing and incredible people in my life,” Grover says. “Carter’s preschool came, they made him pictures and a big poster that everybody signed and drew on. And they brought a bunch of books and they brought Carter’s favorite stuffed lion.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonzales, who owns The Neighborhood Barber in Idaho Falls, says she was recently grateful to learn that her coworkers had planned a fundraiser for Carter titled “Cuts for Carter.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon.jpg" alt="The Cut for Carter fundraiser. | Facebook" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781358" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-300x300.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-150x150.jpg 150w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-860x860.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-500x500.jpg 500w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-600x600.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-100x100.jpg 100w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Cut for Carter fundraiser. | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“My team has just been so incredibly amazing, and they want to help and support,” Gonzales says. “They started a cut-a-thon that they’re hosting at my shop on Oct. 11th, and all the proceeds they get from that day are going to be donated towards Carter’s recovery and to help my sister out with whatever she needs while she’s in Utah.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonzales also started a GoFundMe to raise money for Carter’s medical treatment, recovery, and other expenses while the family is in Utah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-carters-healing-journey"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here to donate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe.jpg" alt="The GoFundMe organized to raise money for Carter's medical expenses. | GoFundMe" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781374" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-300x212.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-768x543.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-860x608.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-708x500.jpg 708w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Carter has really surprised so many doctors and has overcome every challenge that he has been faced with,” Gonzales says. “As he’s grown older, he just keeps proving doctors, and everybody wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grover says she wants the community to know that her mother is strong and an inspiration to the family, which keeps them believing that she will fully recover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She’s an amazing woman.

Olson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, director of the IPN and a professor of chemistry, biochemistry and molecular medicine at UC Davis. “But it’s a little more nuanced than that in terms of who can really benefit and who might be at risk. There are different patient populations.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With mental illness being the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States, the research lays a critical foundation in the search for a viable therapeutic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is an urgent need for treatments in the postpartum period,” said study co-author and IPN affiliate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu/people/danielle-stolzenberg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Danielle Stolzenberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an associate professor of psychology at UC Davis. “I think most importantly what we’ve learned is that the effects of psychedelics can differ based on the ovarian hormone context and that is a critically important finding.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only were psylocibin’s negative impacts long-lasting in mouse mothers (persisting for two weeks after a single dose), but the researchers also found that offspring raised by psylocibin-treated mothers also exhibited anxiety and depression-like symptoms long into adulthood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The finding suggests that the mothers passed on those negative effects via lactation, permanently stunting the offspring’s neurodevelopment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A one-of-a-kind mouse model for postpartum depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was built around Stolzenberg’s innovative mouse model of postpartum depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the model, mouse mothers live with their offspring in a two-cage system that allows them to escape from the demands of motherhood. Stolzenberg found that repeated exposure to a social threat (a male mouse) destabilizes maternal behavior, leading to infant avoidance and triggering other stress responses. These symptoms are hallmarks of postpartum depression in humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One of the things that’s discussed consistently in the clinical literature is that moms often feel like they have trouble bonding with their infants when they’re experiencing depressive symptoms,” Stolzenberg said. “The mouse moms in the social stress paradigm spend significantly more time in the cage without the pups. They will often run back and forth to check on them but tend to actively avoid their infants for long periods of time.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team initially thought the treatment might help alleviate postpartum depression symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Psilocybin was of such interest for us because it’s been demonstrated to be useful across a whole host of mental disorders, including addressing anxiety and depression,” said study first-author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu/people/cassandra-hatzipantelis"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cassandra Hatzipantelis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at the IPN. “We thought it could have the ability to address things that go wrong in postpartum depression like parent-infant connection.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, psilocybin induced the opposite effect, having both negative behavioral impacts on mothers and their offspring. Mouse mothers continued avoiding their offspring and displaying anxiety and depressive-like symptoms. These symptoms persisted after mice were separated from their offspring. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Two weeks after a single dose of psylocibin, the mothers were dramatically impaired,” Hatzipantelis said. “We were shocked.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Psilocybin-treated mice, the researchers found, were at higher risk for behavioral impairments and depressive-like symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was very surprised that we saw the moms getting worse,” Olson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virgin female mice did not show such effects. The findings indicate that there may be distinct neurochemical differences in the brains of mouse mothers that led to psilocybin producing adverse effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We know that ovarian hormones regulate serotonergic signaling, but we understand very little about the interaction between ovarian hormones and drugs that impact serotonin,” said Stolzenberg, noting that the latter is critical to how psychedelics affect the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passing on negative effects to offspring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team also found that behavioral effects were passed to the offspring. Nine weeks after weaning, both male and female offspring exhibited pronounced measures of anxiety and depression compared to the control groups. Their brains also showcased traces of psilocin — a metabolite of psilocybin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We now know that even low doses of exposure can impact offspring for long periods of time,” Stolzenberg said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study highlights the IPN’s commitment to studying both the positive and negative effects of psychedelics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These could be really important therapeutics, but we also realize they have limitations, and we have to conduct rigorous science to understand what those limitations are,” Olson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since its launch in 2023, the IPN has attracted nearly 80 UC Davis faculty affiliates spanning diverse fields from anthropology and chemistry to neuropharmacology and genomics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“UC Davis has incredible experts across a breadth of fields and in specialized domains,” Olson said. “That’s why we can do this type of high impact, interdisciplinary science. It’s really the people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additional study authors include Min Liu, Adam Love, Sadie J.

Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03544-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research also documented notable improvements in the participants’ overall well-being and their performance on several cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was prompted by the rising prevalence of major depression, particularly on college campuses. Existing treatments, such as psychotherapy and medication, are effective for many but do not help everyone and can come with unwanted side effects. Researchers led by Drew D. Decker at The Ohio State University sought to explore a different approach, one that addresses the potential link between metabolic health and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence connects issues like insulin resistance and excess body fat to an increased risk of depression, possibly through inflammatory pathways. The team hypothesized that a dietary intervention known to improve metabolic health, the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, might serve as a beneficial add-on therapy for students already receiving treatment for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed as a single-arm prospective trial, meaning all participants received the same dietary intervention without a comparison control group. Researchers recruited students from The Ohio State University who had been formally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and were currently engaged in counseling or taking medication for their condition. After an extensive screening process to confirm eligibility and rule out conditions like eating disorders, 24 students began the study, with 16 completing the full 10 to 12 week intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we really wanted to make sure of is that we were providing a treatment for people who met the diagnostic criteria for having major depressive disorder,” said co-author Jennifer Cheavens, a professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State who oversaw the clinical assessments. “Each participant had about a 2 1/2-hour interview at the beginning, and then weekly assessments of their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting the diet, each participant received a detailed educational session. The well-formulated ketogenic diet required them to limit carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams per day, consume a moderate amount of protein, and get the rest of their calories from fat, with an emphasis on whole food sources like olive oil, nuts, and fatty fish. To help with adherence and offset costs, the research team provided some staple ketogenic foods and ongoing support from dietitians through a secure messaging application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very important to make sure participants knew what they were getting themselves into,” said Drew Decker, the study’s first author. “And a big part of increasing chances for adherence to the diet was talking to each individual about what they like and don’t like to eat so we could tailor some suggestions for how they could structure their diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, researchers tracked several outcomes. Participants self-reported their depressive symptoms bi-weekly using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A qualified clinician also rated their depression at the start, midpoint, and end of the study using the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression. To confirm they were following the diet, students measured their morning blood ketone and glucose levels daily. Researchers also assessed body composition using scans, collected blood samples to analyze for markers related to metabolism and inflammation, and administered a battery of cognitive tests on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a robust and sustained decrease in depression symptoms. Among the 16 students who completed the study, self-reported depression scores dropped by an average of 69 percent from the beginning to the end of the intervention. Clinician-rated scores showed a similar 71 percent reduction. Every participant who completed the study showed an improvement in their depression scores, and by the end, no one met the criteria for moderate or severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Patel, a psychiatrist at Ohio State who met with the students during the trial, noted the significance of these changes. “The average effect size for medications and counseling after 12 weeks is about 50%, and we saw a substantially greater result,” he said. “That is an impressive finding, that across the board, in this real-world setting, everybody got better, and across the board, our participants did not need more treatment or emergency intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the mental health improvements, participants experienced physical changes. Fifteen of the 16 students lost a clinically significant amount of weight, with an average loss of five kilograms, or about 11 pounds. This weight loss was predominantly from body fat. Blood analysis revealed a 32 percent increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein important for neuron health, and a 52 percent decrease in leptin, a hormone related to body fat and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet was also associated with better cognitive function. Participants showed significant improvements on tests measuring episodic memory, processing speed, and executive functions. For example, they were able to recall more words from a list and complete symbol-matching tasks more quickly at the end of the study compared to the beginning. Their self-reported global well-being also increased nearly threefold over the course of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored whether the improvements in depression were simply a result of weight loss or the presence of ketones in the blood. They found no significant statistical correlation, suggesting the diet’s positive effects on mood may stem from more complex biological changes rather than weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that the ketogenic diet is working through a variety of potentially different mechanisms, there’s a whole range of physiological metabolic adaptations to the diet that could overlap with some of the pathophysiology of depression,” explained Jeff Volek, the study’s senior author and a professor of human sciences at The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors acknowledge several limitations. The single-arm design means it is not possible to definitively separate the effects of the diet from the participants’ ongoing counseling and medication, or from the simple passage of time. The small sample size and the fact that participants volunteered for a diet study could also influence the results. Additionally, repeated cognitive testing can sometimes lead to better scores due to practice, an effect that could not be ruled out without a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is needed to confirm these findings in larger, randomized controlled trials that can more clearly isolate the diet’s impact. Such studies could also help identify the specific biological mechanisms responsible for the observed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the researchers see the results as a promising step toward new treatment options. “We have a treatment gap in that we have more students suffering from mental health concerns than can feasibly receive professional treatment,” Patel said. “There is a need for finding ways of helping students on a large scale. And nutrition is one way we can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volek added that the study provides a solid foundation for further investigation. “So many people are suffering right now, so it’s rewarding to potentially bring forward a solution,” he said. “This is one of the first really well-controlled studies and it has limitations, but the results encourage us to want to keep pursuing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03544-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A pilot study examining a ketogenic diet as an adjunct therapy in college students with major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Drew D.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Howard Sesso, associate director of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/cocoa-extract-reduces-inflammation-aging"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'We also appreciate the important overlap between healthy aging and cardiovascular health, where aging-related inflammation can harden arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of that, we wanted to see whether multi-year cocoa extract supplementation versus a placebo could modulate inflammaging—and the data suggests it does.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/54/9/afaf269/8253933?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;Age and Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, come as part of the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cosmostrial.org/results/"&gt;COSMOS&lt;/a&gt;), a landmark clinical trial investigating the health effects of cocoa flavanols by taking 500mg of cocoa extract supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists identified five different markers in the body that play different roles in the generation and reduction of inflammation that affects the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that cocoa extract had a targeted effect. It significantly reduced levels of hsCRP, a key marker of systemic inflammation associated with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two years, the group taking the cocoa extract saw a significant, year-over-year drop of 8.4 percent in hsCRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, it increased levels of IFN-γ, a marker that plays a vital role in the immune system, stimulating immune cells and 'killer' cells to protect against infections and clear tumor cells from the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three other markers remained mostly unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Flavanols are the key anti-inflammatory component in cocoa extract.

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating breakfast within two hours of waking up helps stabilize blood sugar and supports a healthy metabolism.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping a consistent breakfast time is important for maintaining a healthy body.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study suggests that eating breakfast later in the day may be linked to poor health and a shorter life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While having breakfast an hour earlier won’t automatically extend your life, eating at a consistent time is important for maintaining a healthy weight and more stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study included 2,945 older adults in the United Kingdom. Participants who began eating breakfast later had an increased risk of early death. For every hour breakfast was delayed, mortality risk increased 8% to 11%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Genetics, challenges preparing meals, illness, and sleep issues may have contributed to the shifts in breakfast timing. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings suggest that later breakfast timing may help identify older adults at risk for health problems, but more research is needed to understand the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/timing-of-meals-chrononutrition-7098622" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relationship between breakfast timing and longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Unfortunately, from this publication, we do not know if the later breakfast time is the result or the cause of adverse outcomes in aging,” said &lt;a href="https://scholars.uab.edu/19152-robert-mankowski" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Robert Mankowski, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics, and Palliative Care, who was not involved in the study. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study does not identify a perfect breakfast time. Still, many nutrition experts recommend eating within an hour or two of waking up to break your overnight fast and provide nutrients to fuel the day ahead.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For most people, starting the day with an earlier meal helps set the tone for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-eat-healthy-11682129" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthier eating and better metabolic balance&lt;/a&gt;,” said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/angel-planells" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Angel Planells, MS, RDN, CD&lt;/a&gt;, a Seattle-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Planells added that eating within two hours of waking up helps stabilize blood sugar, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-boost-metabolism-11725404" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kickstart metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and align eating with your circadian rhythm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has shown that having an early breakfast helps improve blood glucose levels and enhances glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response after eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This hormone is naturally released after meals to regulate appetite, support digestion, and manage blood glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When thinking about the best time to eat breakfast, maintaining a consistent schedule is key.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The 'best' breakfast time is one that you can stick to consistently throughout the entire week and feel energized and satiated, but eating breakfast closer to when you wake up is generally better," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/matthew-landry/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Matthew Landry, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of Population Health &amp;amp; Disease Prevention at UC Irvine, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study on the long-term effects of calorie restriction found that consistent breakfast timing was associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/calorie-deficit-vs-intermittent-fasting-8773958" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss and greater calorie restriction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some animal and human research also suggests that eating breakfast consistently supports a healthy circadian rhythm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A disrupted circadian rhythm can lead to drowsiness, difficulty focusing, diabetes, blood pressure problems, and mood disorders.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "When you eat breakfast at roughly the same time each day, you're essentially telling your internal clock: it's time to wake up and time to get to work. I think that’s why we see the connection to metabolism, hormone levels, blood sugar control, and energy levels," Landry said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the new study's findings, eating breakfast an hour early won't magically add years to your life. But there are many potential benefits to eating within two hours of waking up: better glucose control, a healthy circadian rhythm, and weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If it is hard to eat right after waking up, give yourself 60-90 minutes before you start eating. That can give your body time to wake up, and it's still within the healthy 2-hour window," &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/doctor/bethgoodridge" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beth Goodridge, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at Kaiser Permanente in Walnut Creek, CA, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's normal not to feel hungry right when you wake up, but don't wait too long to eat. She added that not eating breakfast means you might make up the missed calories later with higher-calorie foods or larger portions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But there are so many supplements out there—which ones do you truly need and which ones may actually be effective? We asked our editorial team what supplements they take and why. Here's what they said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-d-fish-oil-and-magnesium-glycinate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few supplements I take and swear by—with my doctor's recommendations:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d2-vs-d3-8726305" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is my number one. I take it all year round but less frequently in the summer since I get it naturally. It makes a noticeable difference in my energy levels and mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/fish-oil-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fish oil&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I take it for brain and mental health benefits (and my eye doc says it's good for preventing dry eye).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-glycinate-8415806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Magnesium glycinate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is for when I need help sleeping. It helps me relax and feel drowsy before bed without making me feel groggy in the morning (which melatonin sometimes does). Plus, it's good for muscle relaxation and recovery, so I might take it before bed if I feel sore from a workout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; -&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/author/hannah-harper" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hannah Harper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-womens-multi-vitamin-muscle-recovery-and-stress-management-gummies"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Currently, I take three types of supplement gummies:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women's multi-vitamin:&lt;/strong&gt; I take this because I don't think I get all the nutrients I need from food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muscle recovery sleep gummies:&lt;/strong&gt; They have melatonin, tart cherry extract, and vitamin D to help with my insomnia and muscle recovery. I'm not sure if it's working well for my muscles, but I do feel like it's helped with my sleep recently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management gummies:&lt;/strong&gt; I gummies I take have GABA, L-theanine, and lemon balm. I can definitely tell a difference in my mood from taking these. These are awesome for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; -&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/jasmine-thompson-8735464" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jas Thompson&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-biotin-collagen-and-b12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These are the supplements I take:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-iron"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I take an &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/iron-benefits-7643991" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iron supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to support my &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/ferritin-8718646" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ferritin levels&lt;/a&gt;, which tend to be quite low in female runners.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If I run out of iron or forget to take it for a while, I can usually tell after a few weeks. I feel groggier on my runs. I've been doing this since high school!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; -&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/anisa-arsenault-8747010" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anisa Arsenault&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-psyllium-husk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every morning, I take a &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/psyllium-husk-benefits-7495040" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;psyllium husk supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mixed into 12 ounces of water. I have &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/condition/ibs-overview" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and it's been super helpful in making my digestion more normal. And as someone who often struggles to get enough hydration, it's also nice to start the day with a glass of water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; -&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/jenna-anderson-8722052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jenna Anderson&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-b-complex-and-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I take a &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-b-types-7568850" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B-complex&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every morning. I used to get &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/canker-sores-7503373" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;canker sores&lt;/a&gt; constantly—multiple every month—until I learned that getting my B12 levels up could help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I started taking a regular B-complex supplement, and my random canker sores have disappeared!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I also take vitamin D, but only in the winter. I find it especially important during the darker months when my sun exposure is low.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; -&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/author/dana-ingemann" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dana Ingemann&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-which-supplement-could-be-right-for-you"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not everyone needs a supplement. The supplements you may need are based on your &lt;strong&gt;individual health needs and wants&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are considering taking a new supplement, discuss it with your doctor first. They can let you know if the supplement is right for you and direct you on how to take it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/food/vitamins-what-to-take-what-to-skip" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;purchasing a supplement&lt;/a&gt;, make sure it has been third-party tested. The U.S. Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration does not inspect supplements the same way it does medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A supplement company can have its products third-party tested for ingredient safety. Look for a seal from third-party testers, such as NSF International, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), or ConsumerLab, on the supplement package.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating enough protein throughout the entire day is more important than timing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming high-quality protein before and after exercise, about four to six hours apart, may good for muscle growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein timing is a popular strategy thought to optimize workouts by consuming protein immediately before or after exercise, especially within the anabolic window. Athletes sometimes obsess over this "window of opportunity" to facilitate muscle repair and enhance post-exercise strength.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-the-anabolic-window"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is the "Anabolic Window"? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The "anabolic window" is the 30- to 60-minute post-workout period that’s supposed to be the best time to consume protein for &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-hypertrophy-5079597" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; and recovery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the optimal window—if it exists—can stretch to four to six hours before or after exercise, according to a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There is not an all-or-none switch that if you don’t get protein in now, nothing happens. That’s definitely not the case.” &lt;a href="https://hhp.ufl.edu/about/faculty-staff/gordon,-benjamin,-ph.d./" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Benjamin Gordon, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an instructional assistant professor of applied physiology and kinesiology at the University of Florida, told Verywell.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Proteins contain amino acids that help repair and build muscles, so there are benefits to eating protein both before and after a workout.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s more important to eat enough protein throughout the day than to time it right.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, you need 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight on a daily basis to stay healthy. Athletes who want to gain muscle should eat between 1.2g–2g of protein per kilogram of body weight each day, according to a 2016 position statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada,and the American College of Sports Medicine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re physically active and want to gain muscle, you should prioritize protein in every meal, according to &lt;a href="https://hses.ku.edu/people/ashley-herda" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ashley A. Herda, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor for the exercise science program at the University of Kansas Edwards Campus in Overland Park.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2018 study found that consuming high-quality protein before and after exercise, around four to six hours apart, is best for increasing muscle mass. And the “anabolic window” isn’t that narrow—your muscles can stay sensitized to protein for 24 hours after exercising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein supplements are synonymous with muscle gains in the fitness world, but nutrition experts say it’s better to get protein from food sources first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s best to consider a protein supplement just that—a supplement to an otherwise varied and nutritious eating pattern. Supplements can be beneficial if a person is having trouble meeting their daily protein needs due to their high activity levels or active growth and development,” &lt;a href="https://www.fcs.uga.edu/people/bio/emma-laing" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Emma Laing, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor and director of dietetics at the University of Georgia, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein powders are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so it’s not a guarantee that the contents match what is listed on the label, and some products reportedly contain toxins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people can get enough protein from a regular diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/whey-protein-uses-side-effects-and-more-7498855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/casein-5081318" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;casein&lt;/a&gt; are two protein types that support muscle growth, and they can be found in cow’s milk and some dairy products. Eggs, meat, and beans are also good sources of protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-you-need-more-than-protein-for-muscle-gain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; You Need More Than Protein for Muscle Gain &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is essential for building muscle, but one macronutrient alone isn’t enough. It’s also important to consume healthy fats and to stay hydrated, according to Herda.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Water aids in muscle recovery and helps the body maintain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/homeostasis-6755366" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;homeostasis&lt;/a&gt;. If we even get slightly dehydrated, our systems become disrupted, and that will hinder recovery and gains,” Herda said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are also important since your body needs energy for muscle building. In addition to protein, you should consume 2–3g of carbohydrate per pound of body weight daily, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, RDN, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian based in Miami.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strength training is required for building muscle on top of eating protein and carbohydrates, she added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lifting weights will be more beneficial for building muscle than simply eating more protein, unless you’re not obtaining enough protein through your diet,” Kimberlain said.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A baby in Mississippi has died of whooping cough, the Mississippi State Department of Health announced on Monday, marking the state’s first whooping cough death in 13 years. The infant was less than two months old and was not old enough to receive the pertussis vaccine, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi has seen 115 pertussis cases from Jan. 1, 2025, to Sept. 29. Through all of 2024, the state had only detected 49 whooping cough cases, MSDH reported. Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney said that Mississippi’s last whooping cough deaths were in 2008 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do believe that declining vaccination rates are impacting this,” he told reporters on Sept. 29. “Mississippi, as you know, scores very high with our rate of vaccination for our infants and school-aged children, but we don’t score nearly as well with adults. And so, our concern is that adult Mississippians are not maintaining the pertussis immunity, which puts our babies at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory infection with symptoms like extreme, uncontrollable coughing that causes shortness of breath, he said. It usually starts with a runny nose and congestion that manifests into a violent, uncontrollable cough that often sounds like a “whoop,” the state health officer explained. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pertussis could linger anywhere between two to eight weeks in a person if left untreated, Edney said. In adults, pertussis is typically mild, and he said people usually think they have a common cold. People should quarantine for anywhere between six to 21 days if they have pertussis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That cough can hang around for a very long time, and the longer they have it untreated, the more dangerous,” Edney warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can treat pertussis and slow the spread of the disease to others, he said. Coughing can be particularly dangerous for infants as it can cause breathing complications, he reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lot of times, you know, babies don’t cough; they just stop breathing,” the state health officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edney said the best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated against it and keep up with booster shots every 10 years through the &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/41,0,71.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tdap shot&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for those ages 7 and older and also offers protection against tetanus and diphtheria. Since infants cannot get vaccines until they are two months old, the state health officer said it is especially important for older children and adults to get vaccinated to protect the smallest Mississippians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are some vaccines that are fully protective—like the MMR, measles, mumps, rubella—once you’re vaccinated or you have the illness, then you have personal, lifelong immunity,” he said. “Then we have other vaccines that are more temporary, like tetanus, that’s why you have to get a tetanus booster every 10 years—very protective, but if you don’t stay up to day, then your immunity is going to wane.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women should get the pertussis vaccine or booster, usually offered in conjunction with tetanus and diphtheria as the Tdap shot, between the 27th and 36th week of pregnancy, Edney said. He encouraged families to keep newborns at home and away from many visitors, especially sick people, during the baby’s first six to eight weeks of life. After two months, infants can receive the DTaP shot, which protects against whooping cough for children under 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pertussis falls into the category of vaccines that’s extremely helpful but not fully protective, so we need to keep our immunity rates as best we can to protect the little ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information on vaccinations and how to get them is available on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/14,0,71.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mississippi Department of Health’s website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2021 to 2024, 41 rodents tested positive for plague in the Tahoe Basin area within El Dorado County, and an additional four tested positive in 2025, totaling 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of the outbreak, one visitor who was camping in the area this summer contracted the plague but they recovered after receiving medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a piece for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sfgate.com/renotahoe/article/lake-tahoe-mice-rat-outbreak-unprecedented-21041674.php"&gt;SF Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Brooks revealed he visited a few hardware stores around Lake Tahoe, with workers describing the same trend - booming sales for rodent traps and poison, leading to a run on supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One staff member told him: 'We get cleared out by the end of the day. Everyone in town is going through the same thing right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And at North Shore Ace Hardware in Kings Beach, assistant manager Maurice Jacques revealed locals haven't seen anything like it in 15 to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'We're been upping our orders on mouse traps, really anything to do with mice or rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We get trucks two times a week. By Saturday, we're all out. Some people come in and buy 15 traps at a time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sergio Arias, of Tahoe Pest Management, said that the rodent problem started surfacing in March, and by the summer months it was surging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told SF Gate: 'This year has been out of this world crazy busy for these rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's highly unusual. I have other buddies in the industry. They say, "I can't keep up."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he now gets up to 60 calls a week and visits anywhere from eight to 15 homes per day to eradicate the rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, he might have handled around 20 incidents a month.  In one recent call-out, he said he pulled 70 rats out of one house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'That's not even the worst I've seen. The worst was a vacant home. I think we pulled something like 150 rats out of this home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're chewing through siding. They're chewing through the wood on people's homes to get into the walls.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person from Lake Tahoe tested positive for the Black Death in August&lt;span&gt; after being bitten by an infected flea while camping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California health officials said at the time the person was under the care of a medical professional and was recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It marked El Dorado's first confirmed case of the plague since 2020, which was also believed to have been transmitted in the South Lake Tahoe Area. Prior to that, the disease had not been detected in California since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC map shows confirmed plague cases in the US from 1970 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent US case prior to that was in July&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;, in Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. That patient did not survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the same month, the plague was also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;detected in Arizona &lt;/a&gt;when an unidentified resident became the state's first death from the disease since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resident's cause of death was pneumonic plague, the most dangerous form of the Black Death, which spreads by inhaling droplets of saliva emitted from an infected person or animal coughing or sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado and New Mexico also recorded plague cases last year. The New Mexico patient was the first to be infected with and die of the plague since 2020. Colorado's was the state's first death since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just seven cases of the plague are reported on average in the US each year, according to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-6d2bb000-7dce-11f0-a524-137e79053e67" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant reduction when in medieval times the plague, sometimes referred to as the Black Death, wiped out 25 to 50million people in Europe. This was thought to be 30 to 50 percent of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague cases in the US today are rare, with fewer than ten every year. They mostly occur in the Four Corners region (New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah), where rodents and fleas thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated plague has a mortality rate of 30 to 60 percent in the US. But if it spreads to the lungs or bloodstream, it's nearly 100 percent deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague symptoms strike within one to eight days, with fever, chills, and debilitating fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's often accompanied by painful swollen lymph nodes in the groin or armpits. Left untreated, it can enter the bloodstream and travel to the lungs, causing deadly infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is carried by fleas and transmitted between animals. The picture above is a 3D illustration of the bacterium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows both fatal and non-fatal US plague cases from 2000 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the disease enters cells, it kills them by releasing deadly toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infection can arise from handling infected cats, rodents, or their fleas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the California Department of Health, there were 45 ground squirrels or chipmunks with evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium in the Lake Tahoe Basin from 2021 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Modern antibiotics and hygiene have drastically reduced deaths, but the disease remains endemic in wildlife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials urge caution in high-risk areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recommend wearing long pants tucked into boots and using a bug repellent with DEET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people in the area should never feed or touch wild rodents and refrain from camping new animal burrows or dead rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:01:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>SAPD要求司机在调查期间避开Huebner路附近的I-10西行- KSAT</title><link>https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/09/30/sapd-asks-drivers-to-avoid-i-10-westbound-near-huebner-road-amid-investigation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN ANTONIO&lt;/strong&gt; – A live pipe bomb was found at an apartment complex Tuesday morning along Interstate 10 on the Northwest Side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;San Antonio police Sgt.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow279000h3b7afpk8tywt@published"&gt;My 12-year-old son has not seen his father since we divorced and he moved about seven hours north, 11 years ago. Backstory: Both paternal grandparents and all three of his father’s siblings were drug addicts. When I found out that his father was also using drugs, after we had moved across the country to leave behind that toxic situation, I filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow06m000c3b7az9mxajj6@published"&gt;When my son was younger, I always explained his father’s absence by saying, “Your dad loved you so much but knew he wasn’t able to be a parent. He knew that Mommy loved you and would be able to take care of you always.” This felt like an adequate explanation for a small child, and since he rarely asked questions about his father, I never really went any deeper with it. Now that we are nearing the teen years, I feel like I should give him a more fleshed-out history. I also worry about the genetic predisposition to addiction; from a clinical perspective, this information is necessary for the choices he will be faced with making in the upcoming years.&lt;br&gt;Should I bring up this history in our conversations about why his father, or anyone else from his father’s family, is not in his life? I’m worried that telling him will make him feel like he is genetically cursed, potentially making drugs more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

He has a dad who’s been in his life since he was 2, a little brother who adores him. Maybe he just isn’t interested in knowing about a family he never knew.&lt;/p&gt;

There is nothing inherently shameful about the fact that his father was an addict. Addiction destroys families because it is a personal, physical, and some may even say spiritual sickness that makes its sufferers sacrifice everything they would want to hold dear, including those they love. Addiction is terrible. But it is no more shameful than cancer, and it does not need to be a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owiza00163b7ae2x3gt72@published"&gt;So if and when your son asks, you can be honest. You can say, “Your father had the disease of addiction, and it made it very difficult for him to show up for you and love you as you deserved to be loved. I’m sure he would have liked to have done better, but he could not. And the good news is that I am able to be here and love you and your dad is able to be here and love you, and we always will.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the unfortunate truth is that the science on this is &lt;a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genes/"&gt;equivocal&lt;/a&gt; at best. And there is nothing you can say or not say to your son that will guarantee he won’t try drugs, or even become addicted. Obviously this doesn’t stop us from trying. We tell our children that drugs can have a way of ruining lives for some people, many people, and that no one whose life was destroyed ever thought it was going to happen to them. Addiction is cunning, baffling, and powerful. And we hope these words have an impact. And they may. But there is no way to guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

We have shared custody in which my son spends every other weekend, parts of the summers, and school vacations with his father. I have always encouraged his father to spend as much time with him as possible, and there have been very few issues regarding custody.&lt;/p&gt;

In our town, he has a choice between two high schools: one that is traditional, and the other is specialized and will teach him a trade. I was curious which school he might like to attend, and he brought up that he’d had this conversation with his father already. Apparently his father and stepmom (who is a foreigner) are encouraging my son to go to a high school in their town and live with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p2atv000u3b7av1yfhy9s@published"&gt;This angers me for two reasons. One, his father should have spoken to me about this before bringing it up to our son. I don’t want to get his hopes up only for plans to fall through. Two, my son has lived with me and my husband his whole life. We have raised him to be a competent, respectful, and helpful young man. But like any 12-year-old, he has his faults. I don’t feel like his overly lenient father can provide him the parenting a teenager will require.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s right. He has a choice about where he wants to go to school and also where he wants to live. It’s entirely understandable not to like that. But in this case, not liking something doesn’t make it wrong or unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

And I wonder if and why you feel that way. Nothing in your letter explains why his dad should have less of a right to him than you do. Your kid has two parents. You are one of them. (Surely this can’t be related to your bizarrely xenophobic comment that your husband’s partner is a “foreigner.” You know that “foreigners” also successfully have and raise kids, don’t you?) Your son’s dad has every right to suggest that your son come and live with him in high school. And while I agree that it would have been much kinder of him to bring this up to you before he brought it up to your son, the cat’s out of the bag now.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p20ci000k3b7aiowvh6kc@published"&gt;Your son is in seventh grade, and he doesn’t have to make this decision for a year. Even though the topic was introduced in a less-than-ideal way, it is good that it’s out in the open. This is a big decision and would require serious transition. Having it introduced now gives everyone a chance to sit with it for a while. Your son may be leaning toward it now, but against it later. You may be leaning against it now, but come around later. Either way, your ex did you all a favor by jumping the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

You don’t like his father’s parenting style, but there’s no indication that it’s a bad or dangerous one. Just not what you prefer. I’m sure he has some opinions about your choices as well. (As you know, that’s the wonderful world of co-parenting with an ex.) The point here is that your son spends significant time in his father’s household. He comes back happy and in one piece, and is so comfortable there that he’s considering moving there for high school. What is being suggested here is a change in the custody agreement; in most states, courts will take both households into account as well as your son’s preferences as they decide whether or not to grant it. That is, if you want to take it to court. I would remind you that it’s not necessary to do that yet, and probably better not to do it at all. No kid deserves to see their parents fighting one another in court. It’s clear you care deeply for your son, so you should try with all your might to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;

But if I ask my brother’s fiancée to be one of my bridesmaids, I’m worried that my parents may refuse to pay. My parents and brother are estranged, and have had very limited contact for several years. Their relationship is tumultuous, and I’ve done my best to stay out of it, but frequently I do something that makes my parents think I’ve formed some sort of alliance with my brother. These “infractions” have included attending their daughter’s birthday party, taking photos with her and posting them on Facebook, and going out to dinner with them. This has caused me to also have a somewhat strained relationship with my parents for the past year or so.&lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/dear-prudence-wedding-problems-for-wedding-season-who-pays-who-goes-and-who-goes-too-far.html"&gt; I want my brother’s fiancée to be a bridesmaid and their daughter to be a flower girl, but that also has the potential to cause a big problem. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FENNVILLE, Mich. (WOOD) — A person at Fennville High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No information about the patient’s identity has been released, with officials citing the person’s privacy, but the Fennville Public Schools superintendent said the person has been treated and is expected to be OK. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Tuesday release, the district and the Allegan County Health Department said they have implemented a “comprehensive and coordinated response plan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Our top priority is the health and well-being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Albert Lombard said in a statement. “We appreciate the rapid, seamless coordination with the Allegan County Health Department. We are following all expert protocols to ensure this situation is managed quickly, discreetly, and effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The district and health department said they were working to identify anyone who may have spent an extended period of time in an enclosed space with the patient and will reach out individually to anyone who may have been exposed with instructions for testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are working closing with Fennville Public Schools to ensure that that active and inactive TB cases have access to safe and effective testing and treatment. Although tuberculosis can be a serious condition, it is treatable. Completing treatment is one of the best ways to protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community,” Dr. Richard Tooker, the health department’s medical director, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/keep-mi-healthy/communicablediseases/diseasesandimmunization/tb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a bacterial disease that is often spread when people speak, cough or sing. It does not spread as easily as the cold or the flu, but can be spread among people who are in closed spaces or around each other for an extended period of time. The illness cannot be spread by someone who has inactive TB. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Active TB is diagnosed when a person has a positive test and signs or symptoms, such as an abnormal chest X-ray, night sweats, a cough or weight loss. Officials advised anyone with symptoms to contact their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The district and ACHD stress that while active TB is a serious, contagious condition, it is treatable, and outbreaks are uncommon in U.S. school settings,” the Tuesday release said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, 165 people in Michigan were diagnosed with TB, according to the Michigan Department of Health. In January, a student at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.woodtv.com/news/kalamazoo-county/1-diagnosed-with-active-tb-found-at-kalamazoo-central-hs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kalamazoo High School was diagnosed with TB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using it regularly introduces tens of thousands of microplastic and nanoplastic particles into the body each year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tropical beauty of Thailand’s Phi Phi islands is not the kind of place where most PhD journeys begin. For Sarah Sajedi, however, it was not the beaches themselves but what lay beneath them that sparked her decision to leave a career in business and pursue academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was standing there looking out at this gorgeous view of the Andaman Sea, and then I looked down and beneath my feet were all these pieces of plastic, most of them water bottles,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always had a passion for waste reduction, but I realized that this was a problem with consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sajedi, BSc ’91, decided to return to Concordia to pursue a PhD with a focus on plastic waste. As the co-founder of ERA Environmental Management Solutions, a leading provider of environmental, health, and safety software, she brought decades of experience to compliment her studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her latest paper, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Hazardous Materials&lt;/em&gt;, looks at the science around the health risks posed by single-use plastic water bottles. They are serious, she says, and seriously understudied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Sajedi with Chunjiang An: “Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency but it is not something that should be used in daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tiny threats, little known&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her analysis of more than 140 scientific papers, Sajedi reports that people ingest an estimated 39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles each year. For those who rely on bottled water, that number climbs even higher—about 90,000 additional particles compared to individuals who primarily drink tap water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These particles are invisible to the eye. Microplastics range in size from one micron (a thousandth of a millimeter) to five millimeters, while nanoplastics are smaller than a single micron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are released as plastic bottles are manufactured, stored, transported, and gradually degrade. Because many bottles are made from low-grade plastic, they shed particles whenever they are handled or exposed to sunlight and changes in temperature. Unlike plastics that move through the food chain before entering the human body, these are consumed directly from the container itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_494959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494959" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-494959" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-777x518.jpg" alt="Sarah Sajedi and Chunjiang An" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-777x518.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-768x512.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Sarah-Sajedi-and-Chunjiang-An.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-494959" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sarah Sajedi and Chunjiang An. Credit: Concordia University&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sajedi, the health risks are significant. Once inside the body, these small plastics can pass through biological barriers, enter the bloodstream, and reach major organs. Their presence may contribute to chronic inflammation, cellular oxidative stress, hormone disruption, reproductive issues, neurological damage, and some cancers. Still, their long-term impacts are not fully understood, largely because of limited testing and the absence of standardized ways to measure and track them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sajedi also outlines the range of methods available to detect nano- and microplastics, each with benefits and limitations. Some approaches can locate particles at extremely small scales but cannot reveal their chemical makeup. Others identify the material composition but overlook the tiniest plastics. The most sophisticated and dependable tools are often prohibitively expensive and not widely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Education is the best prevention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sajedi is encouraged by the legislative action that has been adopted by governments around the world aimed at limiting plastic waste. However, she notes that the most common targets are single-use plastic bags, straws, and packaging. Very few address the pressing issue of single-use water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Education is the most important action we can take,” she says. “Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency but it is not something that should be used in daily life. People need to understand that the issue is not acute toxicity—it is chronic toxicity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even “normal” levels of vitamin B12 may not be enough to protect the aging brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UCSF researchers found that older adults with lower, but still technically normal, B12 showed slower processing speeds, more white matter damage, and cognitive weaknesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When “Normal” Vitamin B12 May Not Be Enough&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting the standard daily requirement for vitamin B12, which is essential for making &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_a15e5d2ae3fd42fd6258493af70006cf" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;, red blood cells, and nerve tissue, may not provide enough protection for the brain, particularly in older adults. In fact, falling within the “normal” range could still increase the risk of cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco studied healthy older adults and discovered that participants with lower B12 levels, even though still considered normal, showed neurological and cognitive weaknesses. These individuals had more damage in the brain’s white matter (the network of nerve fibers that allows different regions of the brain to communicate) and scored lower on tests measuring cognitive speed and visual processing compared with those who had higher B12 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rethinking Vitamin B12 Guidelines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of UCSF’s Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, the results raise concerns about whether current B12 recommendations are sufficient and suggest that guidelines may need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said Green, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia. “Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

The richest natural sources are animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. For those who follow vegetarian or vegan diets, B12 can be obtained through fortified foods like breakfast cereals, plant-based milks, and nutritional yeast, or by taking supplements to ensure adequate intake.

&lt;h4&gt;Low B12, Slower Thinking, and Brain Lesions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers enrolled 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment, whose average age was 71. They were recruited through the Brain Aging Network for Cognitive Health (BrANCH) study at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their blood B12 amounts averaged 414.8 pmol/L, well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L. Adjusted for factors like age, sex, education and cardiovascular risks, researchers looked at the biologically active component of B12, which provides a more accurate measure of the amount of the vitamin that the body can utilize. In cognitive testing, participants with lower active B12 were found to have slower processing speed, relating to subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. They also showed significant delays responding to visual stimuli, indicating slower visual processing speeds and general slower brain conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRIs revealed a higher volume of lesions in the participants’ white matter, which may be associated with cognitive decline, dementia, or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implications for Prevention and Future Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study volunteers were older adults, who may have a specific vulnerability to lower levels of B12, co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said that these lower levels could “impact cognition to a greater extent than what we previously thought, and may affect a much larger proportion of the population than we realize.” Beaudry-Richard is currently completing her doctorate in research and medicine at the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition to redefining B12 deficiency, clinicians should consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” she said. “Ultimately, we need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the February 2025 publication, the findings have sparked wide discussion among researchers and clinicians. Several reviews have reinforced the link between low-normal vitamin B12 and subtle neurological damage, pointing out that current guidelines may underestimate the brain’s true requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentators have called for raising the cutoff for deficiency and shifting toward measuring biologically active B12 (holo-transcobalamin) rather than total serum levels, as even “healthy” amounts may leave older adults vulnerable to cognitive decline and white matter damage. Early reports also highlight associations between low active B12 and elevated neurodegeneration markers such as tau protein, strengthening the case for redefining what counts as adequate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — The Chicago Department of Health is encouraging Chicagoans to get vaccinated as respiratory virus season kicks up — and that includes the latest COVID-19 shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city health department has endorsed the vaccination standards set by the Illinois Department of Health for this year’s flu season, recommending everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu, the vast majority of people get vaccinated against COVID-19 and some people get RSV immunization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They mark a rare break with federal recommendations, as vaccine advisers under federal Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have not recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for anyone — but didn’t recommend against it, instead saying that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;“individual decision-making” should determine if someone gets the shot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois offering its own standards was “necessary because the federal government is no longer following its rigorous scientific review processes for vaccine-related decisions,” according to the state health department. The guidelines come out of a “detailed review” by the Illinois Immunization Advisory Committee of state and federal data, guidance documents and other recommendations, according to a press release from the city’s health department. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Respiratory season, which occurs between November and March, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/respiratory-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;encompasses the time of the year when most respiratory infections happen.&lt;/a&gt; These infections can include the common cold, flu, COVID-19, pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health Department will provide free updated flu and COVID-19 vaccines for Chicago residents throughout the season at its immunization clinics. &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/immunization_clinics.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Vaccine+Guidance+2025-26&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.chicago.gov%2fcity%2fen%2fdepts%2fcdph%2fsupp_info%2fclinical_health%2fimmunization_clinics.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1389291&amp;amp;sfmc_id=82406958" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for clinic locations and hours and to register; walk-ins are accepted, but registration is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Monday, COVID-19 vaccines are available at the city clinics for people 12 years and older. COVID-19 vaccines are not yet available for children younger than 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vaccination guidelines: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All children 6 months-23 months.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All adults 18 and older.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Children ages 2-17 who have at least one underlying risk factor, never been vaccinated for COVID-19 before or live with at-risk individuals.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Children ages 2-17 whose parents/guardians want them to get a COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All pregnant people, those who are planning to get pregnant, those postpartum and those lactating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;RSV vaccines are recommended for
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All adults 75 years and older.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All pregnant people during 32-36 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All infants up to 8 months old entering their first RSV season whose mother did not get an RSV vaccine during pregnancy. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Children 8 months-19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Adults ages 50-74 who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although the study has implied a different treatment approach &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;for g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;reen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;amba bite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, challenges still remain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;implement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the antivenoms in hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For example, we also have a lot of monoclonal antibodies now, which are basically, you know, like the next generation of snakebite treatment. So these are antibodies made in the lab compared to conventional antivenoms, which are made by humanised horses,” said Karthik Sunagar, an associate professor who studies animal venoms at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conventional antivenoms are produced by immunising animals, which are sometimes called “humanised” when their immune responses are modified. The process includes introducing animals to small doses of venom and extracting antibodies from their blood to create antivenom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So we make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;monoclonal antibodies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in cell lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; [lab-grown cell populations]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They have to be clinically tested,” Sunagar added&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also found that the venom of the Black Mamba (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dendroaspis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;polylepis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;) varies across Africa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So, r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;egion-specific antivenom treatment is necessary to treat snakebites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; every snake, there will be some kind of regional variation in the snake venom,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pratyush Mohapatra, Officer-in-Charge, Reptilia Section, Zoological Survey of India. For instance, when a person is being treated with the antivenom developed from a north Indian snake for a snakebite &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Chennai, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; becomes less effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This regional variation in snake venom can be addressed by regionally producing antivenom for a specific state or geographic locality,” Mohapatra added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also read:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theprint.in/science/in-last-3-decades-ganga-dried-up-at-highest-rate-in-1000-yrs-its-not-just-climate-change/2752606/"&gt;&lt;em&gt; In last 3 decades, Ganga dried up at highest rate in 1,000 yrs. ‘It’s not just climate change’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Snakebites in India&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;reen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;amba doesn’t exist in India, more research into snakebites and related reactions in the human body is necessary in the country. “India is now targeting zero snakebite death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So, we are on a mission to zero down or at least reduce it to half by 2030,” said Mohapatra. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://shorturl.at/afvsm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;May 2025 report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time to Bite Back: Catalysing a Global Response to Snakebite Envenoming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; India ranked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in snakebite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;related deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hospital-based data reflect poorly the national burden of fatal snakebites,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3075236/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;noted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a study on snakebite mortality in India 15 years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;today,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; snakebites in India are not documented, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the database isn’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;updated in a timely manner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; which makes it difficult to pin down the deaths to a number, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an expert in snake venom research who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;did not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; want to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;named.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At times, snakebites can cause a different reaction in the body, other than muscle paralysis as in the case of the African mamba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“India’s most medically important snake, which is the most clinically relevant species in the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; doesn’t cause neuromuscular paralysis. It affects the ability of your blood to clot,” said Sunagar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. His &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lab &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; IISc has shown that different snakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the same area can have very &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;different venoms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that become challenging to neutralise with conventional approaches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenges in snakebite research mostly boil down to funding for fundamental research, according to Sunagar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; who heads the Evolutionary Venomics Lab in IISc. Nonetheless, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;his lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is in collaboration with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to fund clinical trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Eventually, we’ll rely on ICMR’s clinical network for testing these &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on the ground,” Sunagar said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most research in India is focused on toxicity in common types of snakes, called the Big Four group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Russell’s viper, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ommon krait, Indian cobra, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indian saw-scaled viper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But we definitely need more studies on the effects of venom of all other species of potentially dangerous snakes,” Mohapatra &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the chances of snakebites from snakes that don’t fall into the Big Four category are less, the lack of research ails the toxicology side effects of snakebite. “The bites might lead to long-term effects of venom, which may affect the kidneys of the victim,” Mohapatra added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So, we need studies on other species of venomous or potentially dangerous snakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Here, experts break down the differences among the three RSV vaccines that have been approved for use in the U.S., plus the possible side effects, when you should be concerned about a reaction to the vaccine, and if it's safe to get. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, a.k.a. RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC).

One of those study participants died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In another study, one participant (again out of 2,500) developed Guillain-Barré syndrome nine days after receiving the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/168889/download?attachment" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/media/168889/download?attachment" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on Abrysvo of over 18,500 people, one person developed Guillain-Barré syndrome seven days after they were vaccinated, while another developed Miller Fisher Syndrome, which is a rare form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, eight days after they received the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You can develop Guillain-Barré syndrome from other causes, making it tricky to pin it to the vaccines. “Given the small number, it is unclear whether the vaccine caused these events, or whether they occurred due to chance,” Dr. Adalja said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Both the FDA and CDC’s advisory committee thought that these cases were probably coincidental, but that’s something that people are keeping an eye on,” Dr. Schaffner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="28" data-lazy-id="P0-19"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Is the RSV vaccine safe to get?" data-anchor-id="is-the-rsv-vaccine-safe-to-get" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;Is the RSV vaccine safe to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;On the whole, doctors said the vaccine is safe. “The RSV vaccine is very safe based on the clinical trial data,” Dr. Adalja said. “The risk-benefit ratio favors it in the approved groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Schaffner agreed. “The vaccine is safe,” he said, adding that both he and his wife get it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, Dr. Russo said that choosing to get the RSV vaccine comes down to your individual risk-benefit ratio. “There’s little question that if you’re 60 and older and you have significant underlying cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, or other significant comorbidities, the benefits of vaccination really outweigh any potential risks,” he said. “Those people should get vaccinated. RSV can be as deadly as influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But, Dr. Russo said, if you’re “perfectly healthy” and over 60, he recommended talking to your healthcare provider about whether you should receive the vaccine. “Certainly in high-risk groups, there’s little question where the benefit exceeds a potential and ill-defined risk," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="33" data-lazy-id="P0-20"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Is there anyone who should not get the RSV vaccine?

Residents should contact their local health departments or pharmacies for more information on specific vaccine clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-element"&gt;&lt;div class="image-rootCenter"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1ez1ofp"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background "&gt;&lt;span class="image-img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-credit"&gt;(Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) Vials of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine are stored in a freezer at the Salt Lake Public Health Center in Salt Lake City, Monday, Sept. 29, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do you need to qualify for a vaccine in Salt Lake County? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Prescriptions are not required, and those age 65 and older can just request a booster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;But individuals between 6 months old and 64 years old will have to sign a statement or “attestation” that they have an underlying health condition that would put them at risk for a severe case of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Those conditions are defined in guidance from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;, and they include factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, pregnancy or cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The person signing a statement does not need to specify which condition they have, Rupp said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the vaccine cost? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department will bill the health plans it accepts; &lt;a href="https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/globalassets/1-site-files/animal-services/events/accepted-insurance-plans-march-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a list of those plans can be found on the county website.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;For those who would like to pay out-of-pocket themselves, the vaccination costs $105-$158 Rupp added, depending on the age of the patient and which brand of vaccine they receive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you get a vaccination at your local pharmacy? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;National chains like Walgreens and CVS also offer COVID-19 boosters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In Utah, CVS plans to offer vaccines without a prescription as soon as Tuesday, due to the new guidance from the Division of Professional Licensing, a spokesperson said. Without that guidance, the chain required patients to have a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Walgreens will allow anyone aged six months or older to get a COVID-19 booster as long as they discuss it with a pharmacist, a Walgreens spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why has guidance on COVID-19 boosters changed so much recently?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There is a three-step process for vaccines to become available in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;First, the Food and Drug Administration must approve a vaccine for use nationwide. For the 2025-2026 COVID vaccine, the FDA approved the booster for those 65 and older, along with those between 6 months old and 64 years old who have an underlying health condition, Rupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Then, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices decides on guidance for how to use the vaccine, Rupp continued. The committee, which is typically made up of virologists and infectious disease experts, reviews studies and data to make a recommendation on who should get certain immunizations and how often, along with dosage amounts, Rupp added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;On Sept. 19, the committee — also known as the ACIP — made a rare &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommendation that was not in alignment with the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, Rupp said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;ACIP approved the vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older, regardless of whether an individual has an underlying health condition, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“They did say, ‘We want to highlight the greatest benefit to receiving the vaccine if you’re under 65 is if you have an underlying health condition, and you should have that conversation with your physician,’” Rupp said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“They were really careful to call that out — that it’s best for people who have an underlying condition if they’re under 65," he said, “but they didn’t say it’s only approved for people who have an underlying health condition if they’re under 65, which is what the FDA did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Once ACIP makes its recommendation, the director of the Centers for Disease Control will review that guidance and determine the official CDC recommendation for the country, Rupp added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The interim director of the CDC has not yet adopted ACIP’s recommendation, so Utah providers could not adopt the committee’s guidance yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;But the Division of Professional Licensing’s recent letter allows Utah providers to adopt ACIP’s guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“It is now much more of an option for many people,” said state epidemiologist Leisha Nolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“But I would say it probably will take a few days, if not a week, for a lot of the pharmacies to get the stock in place, [to] get ready to do this,” Nolen added. “So I would still suggest people call ahead and make sure that where they’re intending to go has the vaccine ready and are able to administer it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 12:13:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFA0bGRmemRFZzgxbDdUc3dOLUlmaFZ5ZWRES3A5Sy1nVlNRc2l4VU1uSVBOeU92dnZUQktTQ3lNY0tDSk5rRm1Xb2dQLWpPX2xzZWJ3WU5yUC1XQjJTdERUNjRiU0tFd21yNHRfTkxnWGhoM1BNSkhrUzZZd3c</guid></item><item><title>Jill Martin关于乳腺癌基因检测的研究- TODAY.com</title><link>https://www.today.com/health/jill-martin-breast-cancer-update-genetic-testing-rcna233417</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5ac98" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jill Martin is the TODAY lifestyle contributor and founder of By Jill Martin. In 2023, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/jill-martin-breast-cancer-diagnosis-rcna94105" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;she was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Now, she’s raising awareness about genetic testing and helping to fund breast cancer research through her brand, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jillmartin.com/pages/warrior-shop?srsltid=AfmBOopGB330SP5NzSE8YVPTvYHHamMOFvKgCQ6w_gplUzJu2QL_7Npb" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Warrior Effect.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Ahead of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/pink-power-day-2025-rcna229282" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pink Power Day on the TODAY Plaza Oct. 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Martin opened up to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://today.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; about her life now as a cancer survivor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-269845" class="body-graf"&gt;As soon as I received the diagnosis of Stage 2 breast cancer in July 2023, I immediately went into fight or flight mode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec837" class="body-graf"&gt;My life was suddenly centered around beating cancer and what I needed to do. I agreed to the recommended treatments, including a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, two reconstructive surgeries and surgery to remove my ovaries and fallopian tubes to prevent ovarian cancer. I focused on ticking each therapy off the list, and that dedication carried me through cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-549386" class="body-graf"&gt;Today, the intense and terrifying treatment is over, and I am cancer-free. Yet, my fight is now focused on a new goal. I'm still undergoing treatment to prevent breast cancer from returning, but it’s focused on medications I can take at home. I’m on a hormone blocker to stop my body from producing estrogen, as well as a targeted therapy that helps prevent the recurrence of cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45d6b1" class="body-graf"&gt;While not as intense as some of the other treatments I received, these medications still cause side effects, including extreme joint and bone pain, which I continue to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94a288" class="body-graf"&gt;This past spring, I also had a revision to my reconstructive surgery. Radiation changes the skin, so I experienced some complications after the first surgery. It was my sixth surgery in two years. Luckily, my doctor said I am finished with surgery — and now, I can focus on healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8f12b6" class="body-heading"&gt;Looking Back and Moving Forward &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24fdd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, I have the space to process all of the emotions that I felt throughout my breast cancer treatment. At times, it's tough to grapple with what I’ve been through. When I reflect on that time, I remember constantly going from treatment to treatment, feeling as though I was fighting for my life. I also have quiet moments when I confront the emotions of being a cancer patient and now, a survivor. While thinking about what I’ve overcome helps me feel resilient, it's also overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-da6f22" class="pullquote" data-testid="pullquote-medium"&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote__quote" data-testid="pullquote-quote"&gt; I choose to be the victor, not the victim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c1a55" class="body-graf"&gt;I’m living in my new body, and I am grateful for the way my body fought for me. But it will never look the same. This part of my body that I used to think of as sexy is now the badge of honor from a battle I fought and won. I’m glad that I’m not in pain and I don’t have cancer, but my body is a reminder that I am a changed person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b812b7" class="body-graf"&gt;I’ve also learned to balance my life. I dedicate 33% of my time to work, 33% to giving back and 33% to Jill time. When it’s my time, I might take a walk or call a friend — just do something that nourishes me. I live with more intentionality, and I ask myself whether something serves me before I decide to pursue it. This transformation has been one of the unexpected gifts I received from having cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8cf5b9" class="body-heading"&gt;From Fighting Back to Giving Back &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63b031" class="body-graf"&gt;Today, I am focused on launching the &lt;a href="https://jillmartin.com/pages/warrior-shop?srsltid=AfmBOopGB330SP5NzSE8YVPTvYHHamMOFvKgCQ6w_gplUzJu2QL_7Npb" target="_blank"&gt;Warrior Effect&lt;/a&gt;, a brand that highlights the cancer journey by donating proceeds to the Breast Cancer Research Fund (BCRF). Every day when I wake up, I have to decide between pulling the covers over my head, or moving forward. I choose to be the victor, not the victim. Every time I face a difficult moment, my strength improves, and I become more resilient. To me, that is the "warrior effect" that we all have. But for many of us, we need to learn to embrace it and let it carry us through our days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff537e" class="body-graf"&gt;I wanted to create a brand that honors the cancer journey and the strength of people going through it while also giving back. Beginning October 1, 2025, all month, a portion of proceeds from every item sold — including exclusive Warrior Collection essentials and select officially licensed NBA and WNBA pink logo products — will be donated to BCRF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-e8a44e" class="pullquote pullquote--small" data-testid="pullquote-small"&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote__quote" data-testid="pullquote-quote"&gt;Research saves lives, and I’m honored to be helping in my way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cf70d" class="body-graf"&gt;I’m alive and sharing my story thanks to research. Every new advancement in breast cancer screening and treatment comes from research. Research saves lives, and I’m honored to be helping in my way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62f165" class="body-graf"&gt;While the Warrior Effect will help scientists studying breast cancer, I’m also passionate about genetic testing. So to encourage others to learn everything they can about their health, I'm hoping to bring people together to sign up for genetic testing for &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/pink-power-day-2025-rcna229282" target="_blank"&gt;Pink Power Day&lt;/a&gt; on Oct. 1 on the TODAY Plaza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f1d0d" class="body-graf"&gt;Knowledge is power. I believe it’s essential that women understand their breast cancer risk and undergo genetic testing if they can. If I had known I carried the BRCA 2 mutation earlier, I could have avoided chemotherapy and radiation and ongoing treatment. Early detection doesn’t simply save lives; it changes them.

And it’s no wonder. People all over the world complain of insomnia and not getting enough sleep, driving a market for sleep aids worth more than US$100 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientists warn that online hacks and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00965-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00965-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;pricey tools&lt;/a&gt; aren’t always effective. And failed attempts to remedy the situation could have negative effects, says Andrew McHill, a circadian scientist at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland. “It could discourage people from finding help, and things could get worse,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02225-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03148-8/d41586-025-03148-8_51235262.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How the brain wakes up from sleep — and produces that morning feeling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, researchers point to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22736" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22736" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;lessons coming from circadian science&lt;/a&gt;, which over the past five decades has exposed a network of biological clocks throughout the body. This timekeeping machinery ensures that physiological systems are primed to do the right things at the right times — such as defend against pathogens, digest food and sleep. But circadian clocks don’t cycle precisely on their own. To stay in sync and function optimally, they need regular calibration from sunlight, daily routines and other cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern life doesn’t often cooperate. People spend much of their time indoors. They eat late into the night. They &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00723-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00723-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;shift sleep schedules between workdays and weekends&lt;/a&gt;, effectively jet-lagging themselves. The toll is steep. In the short term, circadian disruption and insufficient sleep can reduce cognition, mood and reaction time. In the long term, they can increase risks of infections, diabetes, depression, dementia, cancer, heart disease and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01044-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01044-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;For better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and overall health, McHill and other scientists emphasize three basics: contrasting light and dark, consolidating mealtimes and keeping sleep times consistent. “Simply taking a walk outside during the day and reducing our light exposure in the evening could have great effect,” says McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seek contrasts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light provides the most powerful signal to the circadian system. Blue wavelengths are especially potent. That is not a coincidence. Humans evolved outdoors, under the sky. And the midday sky is rich in blue light. Still, common advice about avoiding blue light at night captures only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s and 2000s, a string of discoveries proved the existence of light-sensitive cells in the eye that are not directly involved in seeing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Rather, these cells &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/458142a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/458142a" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;synchronize body clocks&lt;/a&gt;. They detect both intensity and wavelength, with input from rods and cones, and relay those data to a circadian pacemaker in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circadian system requires bright light to operate properly. “But we’re pretty bad at determining how much light we’re getting,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep and circadian scientist at Stanford University in California. Typical home lighting of 100–250 lux might feel like a lot to the eye. But the blue-rich daylight that the circadian system is primed to detect shines orders of magnitude brighter — upwards of 10,000 lux even on an overcast day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing matters, too. Bright blue light during the daytime synchronizes circadian rhythms and supports the nightly surge of melatonin — the hormone signal that tells the body it’s time to sleep. It can also directly boost alertness and cognitive performance. The same illumination at night, from artificial lights and glowing screens, confuses the circadian system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01044-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03148-8/d41586-025-03148-8_50831204.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Unlocking the secrets of sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue light is the strongest disruptor, but enough photons of any colour at night can shift rhythms, suppress melatonin levels and hinder sleep. Exposure in the middle of the night, such as with a flip of a toilet light switch, is most disruptive, says Zeitzer. The circadian system’s sensitivity peaks near the midpoint of sleep, when it least expects light. Studies show that even dim light, such as a hallway bulb, can raise overnight heart rate and impair sleep&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, scientists say, what matters most is contrast: bright days and dark nights. In fact, light during the day can buffer against the potential harms of light at night, says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Mounting research links greater daytime light exposure with stronger circadian rhythms and higher sleep quality. One study of college students found that their total hours of light exposure during the day better predicted their bedtimes and wake times than did light exposure after dusk&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “The more light you get during the day, the better you’ll sleep at night,” says Figueiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too little daylight and too much night light could even shorten life expectancy. A UK study of nearly 90,000 people found that the 20% with the poorest light-exposure patterns were predicted to die around five years earlier than were the 20% with the healthiest habits, even after accounting for factors such as income and physical activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Phillips, a sleep health scientist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and an author of the study, pins the explanation on circadian rhythms: “They regulate every aspect of your physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, achieving this daily contrast is difficult in the modern world. Indoor lighting leans on green wavelengths that serve vision but not circadian signalling. Energy-usage codes limit how bright those fixtures shine. Daylight entering through windows gets quickly diluted. And energy-efficient window glass and blue-light-blocking spectacle-lens coatings further reduce how many circadian-stimulating photons reach the eyes. Ageing compounds the problem; people’s lenses become more yellow over time and filter out more blue light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian science’s prescription: spend more time outdoors, sit near windows and use daylight-mimicking light-emitting-diode lamps during the day. In the evening, lower the brightness of lamps and power down screens — or use apps that dim or shift screens to a warmer spectrum. And consider a low-intensity amber night light for the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists note that the precise prescription is personal. Even &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people of the same age can vary considerably&lt;/a&gt; in how they respond to the same light, possibly because of characteristics such as sex or eye colour. And when light comes from screens, the content can matter as much as the light itself. “If you’re on an iPad at 11 at night, then the light exposure might have some effect,” says Zeitzer. “But if you are doing something relaxing, that might outweigh the effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Consolidate calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calorie intake is also intricately linked with circadian rhythms and sleep. The human liver at 10 a.m. and the human liver at 10 p.m. are very different organs. The same can be said for other parts of the body that process food. Hunger hormones, digestive enzymes and glucose-regulating insulin have rhythms, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are simply not equipped to deal with food at all hours, says Emily Manoogian, a circadian scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California. Late morning to early afternoon is when the body is usually most prepared for incoming calories. Eating late in the evening disrupts clocks and leaves key steps of digestion incomplete. It can also disrupt the gut microbiome, which could contribute to insomnia&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What’s more, late meals send blood to the gut and raise core body temperature, countering the natural night-time dip that promotes sleep. And they elevate glucose levels and uncouple liver and kidney clocks from the core clock in the brain, raising the chance of midnight toilet trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manoogian and others suggest reviving the old adage: eat like a king in the morning, a prince at noon and a peasant at dinner. That last meal, they say, should fall at least three hours before bedtime, ideally with no subsequent snacks or caloric drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01910-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03148-8/d41586-025-03148-8_51209366.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Revealed: how the brain turns stress into a bad night’s sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food quality matters, too. Diets high in sugar and saturated fat lighten and fragment sleep. Caffeine lingers for hours. And alcohol is deceptively disruptive: “You might fall asleep, but the quality of your sleep will be quite poor,” says Manoogian. On the flip side, eating some plant-based foods during the day could improve sleep. Research shows that walnuts boost melatonin levels and sleep quality&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Marie-Pierre St Onge, a nutrition, sleep and circadian scientist at Columbia University in New York City, co-authored a study that links greater daytime intake of fruits and vegetables with less-fragmented sleep&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The most common type of breast cancer thrives in an oestrogen-rich environment and one of the most successful treatments for breast cancer is to starve it of oestrogen,” says Prof Vaidya. “For example, the drug Tamoxifen (which many women take after breast cancer) prevents oestrogen from stimulating cancer cells and reduces relapse; it has saved thousands of lives. So creating an oestrogen-rich environment in the body with the addition of HRT can raise the risk of cancer flourishing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Vaidya is also keen to point out that not every woman has unpleasant symptoms when going through the menopause. “But for those who do, it can be severe, he says. “A woman is already anxious after a breast cancer diagnosis and these symptoms can make life more miserable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, women told the research team how their concerns and suffering were dismissed. “The oncologist completely shut me down when I tried to mention HRT,” said one patient. “The gynaecological consultant said anyone that prescribes me HRT should be struck off”, said another. “I read the available literature, saw a private menopause specialist, and [the] GP would still not prescribe, so I changed GPs. What a battle when I had been through so much and was feeling so unwell. I honestly wanted to die; it was so awful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients reported being put on antidepressants – a potentially inappropriate treatment that can come with side-effects and the risk of dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Shared decision-making is key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal, says Dr Glynne, is for patients to receive individualised care, taking into account their medical history, preferences, and treatment goals. “Shared decision-making is key to ensure women can make informed treatment choices that are right for them,” she says. “We want to treat the woman as a whole, after discussion with the oncologist, and to frame risk in a way the patient will understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading of risk is crucial here. There are several different types of breast cancer recurrence – and some more serious than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can get cancer in the same breast which is usually successfully treatable, as is cancer in the other breast,” says Prof Vaidya. “Getting cancer elsewhere in the body – what we call a ‘distant’ recurrence’ – is the most life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked closely, we found in these studies that only a small portion of relapses were distant relapses,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Prof Vaidya and Dr Glynne are hoping the new paper will encourage breast cancer specialists to recognise the importance of menopausal symptoms and the fact they need specialist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One needs to strike a balance, and consider the whole person,” says Prof Vaidya. “Medicine is about the quality of life, as well as the length of it. But we don’t want women to just say they want HRT, and for it to be given freely. The decision would depend on how severe their menopause symptoms are, their specific risk profile and their understanding that there is an increased risk of relapse. It should be a joint, informed decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now hoping to win funding for a large clinical study, called the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.londonbreastcancer.com/meno-abc-trial"&gt;MENO-ABC trial&lt;/a&gt;, to carry out further research on the benefits and risks of taking HRT after breast cancer. Everyone who has had breast cancer and has menopausal symptoms is eligible to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to look at not just the potential harms of HRT, such as an improvement of quality of life, and the positive effects on areas such as bone health,” says Dr Glynne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that there will be a balance,” says Prof Vaidya. “We’re not saying we will open the doors to everyone – and it might not be appropriate for every breast cancer survivor to be prescribed HRT. But let’s discuss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be it a cool iced coffee or warm cup of soup, the temperature of what we eat and drink may influence our mental and digestive health, according to new research led by San Diego State University.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S000711452510514X" target="_blank"&gt;British Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, examined more than 400 Asian and white adults across the United States. Researchers found that food and beverage &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/temperature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;, long recognized in traditional Asian medicine, has measurable links to anxiety, insomnia, and gut discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, among Asian adult participants, higher summer cold drink consumption was associated with increased anxiety, more sleep disturbances, and greater feelings of abdominal fullness. In contrast, white participants who drank more hot beverages in winter reported lower levels of depression, improved sleep quality, and fewer digestive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the U.S. to directly link cold and hot dietary consumption to multiple health outcomes, with important implications for addressing rising rates of anxiety, insomnia and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Something as simple as the temperature of what we eat and drink can have real impacts on health," said Tianying Wu, SDSU associate professor of epidemiology, and the study's lead author. "Because cold and hot consumption is such a routine part of daily life in the U.S., at home and in restaurants, the findings have broad relevance to everyday health choices."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was based on data from SDSU's Healthy Aging Survey, which investigates novel risk factors and health disparities among U.S. populations.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study also found that the effects were most pronounced in participants who frequently reported "cold hands," a possible indicator of reduced circulation. Subgroup analysis showed that Chinese participants, who consumed the least cold foods and drinks, experienced fewer adverse outcomes, while Asian Indians showed stronger associations between cold consumption and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adverse+health+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adverse health effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Western nutrition guidance rarely considers the temperature of food and drinks, the results, according to the researchers, echo long-held practices in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, which warn against excessive cold consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research provides a snapshot of how hot and cold consumption may relate to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+outcomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;," said Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The next step is to conduct more rigorous prospective and intervention studies, since the effects can be dynamic—for example, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; or individuals with poor circulation may be especially vulnerable to cold exposure."&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. who has advocated for beef tallow as part of his campaign to eliminate ultra-processed seed oils from American diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZIEGLCOMJHTZBFAM5NTIRSTZU"&gt;“Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients that we have in foods.

One photographer roamed the city's financial district amid an eerie emptiness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There had been hope that Covid-19 would have ebbed away in the northern hemisphere by the end of summer in 2020. Instead, a new wave of the disease appeared in earnest towards the end of August. In little more than a month, it would spark new lockdowns in the UK – and again plunge once-busy city centres into an eerie emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some blame was directed at a government programme called &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67658106" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;"Eat Out to Help Out"&lt;/a&gt;, which urged people to dine on subsidised meals at local pubs and restaurants. Held from 3-31 August 2020, the scheme was enormously popular as visitor numbers in the venues taking part soared by &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54015221" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;more than 50%&lt;/a&gt; compared to the previous August, before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But with the diners came Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The number of confirmed Covid-19 infections, which had been dropping, started to rise again.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a bold step towards tackling the HIV epidemic, the Ministry of Health and Wellness is now considering a pilot programme for the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved injectable HIV prevention drug, lenacapavir.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug has been described by former United States President Bill Clinton as “a genuine chance to end” the global epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaica’s decision to embark on the pilot was revealed by Dr Nicola Skyers, senior medical officer of the National HIV/STI programme in the Ministry of Health, who explained that there are also plans for the roll-out of cabotegravir, another injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), taken once every two months for the prevention of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Skyers, lenacapavir, which is to be administered twice a year, will be available free of cost in the public health system. That was confirmed by Health and Wellness Minister Dr Christopher Tufton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The current thought is to do that, but a lot depends on what turns out in the pilot, and how it evolves over time, but the thought is have it free in the public health system because we’re targeting vulnerable groups and that represents a particular segment of the population,” Tufton, who is on assignment overseas, told the &lt;b&gt;Jamaica Observer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Skyers noted that the ministry’s push for the pilot comes even as it accepts that the cost of the injectable antiretrovirals (ARVs) “is quite prohibitive at this point”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have injectables for prevention, and we have injectables for treatment, two different target groups, and we are exploring both,” she told the &lt;b&gt;Observer &lt;/b&gt;on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In terms of prevention, yes, the pilot will be done. That is cabotegravir. Lenacapavir is more of a treatment-based one, but for both injectables in general, we are looking at pilots. We would focus on persons who are most at risk for use, and then certainly, as the pricing becomes within our budget, we can scale up the use,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lenacapavir offers a highly effective, long-acting alternative to daily oral pills and other shorter-acting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Skyers noted that the injectable HIV prevention and treatment drugs will be particularly impactful as Jamaica is “not a pill-taking country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I definitely see that [lenacapavir] as a benefit, but we don’t like needles either, so we have to also create that balance, but I believe that overall it can have a significant impact if we get more persons on it, especially for younger persons who might not be as adherent to the pills,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For older persons, they are quite comfortable; they have been taking [pills] for diabetes, taking them for hypertension. So we do find that our older persons are actually doing better because they are more cultured towards taking pills, so they tend to do well,” Dr Skyers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, really, the injectables would be addressing the issues we have around adherence [because] you’re taking an injection every three or six months, depending on which medication we are talking about. And it covers you for that period, so certainly it will address some of the issues that we’re having with adherence,” Dr Skyers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is set to be rolled out at the end of this year in the United States at a cost of US$28,000 per person annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, 120 low- and middle-income countries will have access to the groundbreaking HIV treatment and prevention drug in 2027 at a reduced cost of US$40 per person each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows an agreement reached between the Clinton Health Access Initiative co-founded by the former US president, the Gates Foundation, and Wits RHI to partner with Indian manufacturers to scale up the production and distribution of lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, 1.3 million new HIV infections were recorded worldwide and experts have said that lenacapavir could have a transformative effect on that figure as it almost completely prevented new cases of HIV in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the WHO recommended it as a preventive drug or PrEP, with the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus describing it as “the next best thing” to an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, two young Jamaicans with whom the &lt;b&gt;Observer&lt;/b&gt; spoke said they would be willing to take lenacapavir as an added HIV protection measure if made available at a reduced cost rather than the daily oral pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would choose the injection because it is only twice per year as compared to the pill, which you have to take daily. Sometimes you may forget, and not everybody likes swallowing pills,” said a University of the West Indies (UWI) student who gave her name as Angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While noting that she may not be able to afford the pill at the initially announced cost of US$28,000, Angel shared that if the cost is reduced, then she would choose the injectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The young people would opt to take it because I am pretty sure nobody wants to contract HIV. It’s not something that goes away; it is a lifetime disease, so I think the young people would want to take the necessary precautions so as not to get this disease,” Angel added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anishka, another UWI student, said that she would consider taking the injectable HIV prevention drug as it would be more convenient than oral PrEP pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be something that I would consider because the disease, in general, is very detrimental, and I think taking the proper precaution and step as a young adult is very necessary for the benefit of my health and my future generations to come… Seeing that you would have to take [oral] PrEP more often than the injection, I would be more open to injectable drugs than having to remember to take this pill every day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jamaica, there are about 26,000 HIV/AIDS-positive individuals, according to the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 2023 report.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;After years of research, scientists have discovered that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; is often preceded by a silent, symptomless stage. Catching the autoimmune disorder earlier could mean lessening the painful joint inflammation and damage, or even stopping its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people who develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are deemed at risk years before the appearance of joint inflammation (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"&gt;synovitis)&lt;/a&gt;, due to the presence of anticitrullinated protein  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="175541" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; (ACPAs) in their blood. However, not everyone with ACPAs develops RA, and it hasn't been clear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study reveals new warning signs doctors could use to identify who is most at risk, which include inflammatory proteins in the blood and the behavior of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-immune-system-weighs-the-same-as-a-pineapple-study-finds"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; (which drive RA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/arthritis-affects-thousands-of-kids-and-one-piece-of-advice-is-crucial"&gt;Arthritis Affects Thousands of Kids, And One Piece of Advice Is Crucial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the work of a US team, led by researchers from the Allen Institute of Immunology, the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU Anschutz).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results support the concept that RA inflammatory disease begins well before the onset of active synovitis, earlier than clinically appreciated," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has implications for decisions about when to initiate preemptive treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed the progress of 45 individuals determined to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shocking-study-says-no-cold-isnt-making-your-joints-ache-so-whats-going-on"&gt;at risk of RA&lt;/a&gt; based on being ACPA positive, 16 of whom went on to develop full RA. Together with data from healthy controls, this gave the team a host of biological comparison points to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the blood of the at-risk participants, proteins linked to the immune system were much more abundant and active, while &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"&gt;B cells&lt;/a&gt; (which make antibodies) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; (which coordinate B cells) showed signs of being in a higher stage of alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to an RA diagnosis, the number of T cells and B cells primed for inflammation action increased, including T cells that would otherwise be more neutrally configured. It's as if the immune system can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immune-system-memory-might-explain-why-arthritis-flares-up-the-same-joints-twice"&gt;see what's coming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175544" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="Inflammatory proteins" class="wp-image-175544 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ProteinChart-600x220.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175544" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Inflammatory proteins were found to be more abundant in a group made up predominantly of people at risk of arthritis (C6). (He et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Transl. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some overlap between those who did and didn't develop RA in terms of these fundamental changes, but they give us a clearer picture of how the at-risk stage develops into a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/arthritis-affects-thousands-of-kids-and-one-piece-of-advice-is-crucial"&gt;full clinical diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings characterize pathogenesis of the ACPA+ at-risk stage and support the concept that the disease begins much earlier than clinical RA," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are brand-new findings, so any treatments are still a way off, but knowing more about how the immune system ramps up and shifts its activity before RA starts could ultimately help researchers target those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug abatacept is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)02649-1"&gt;already in use&lt;/a&gt; as a way of delaying RA in high-risk cases, and there's evidence that it helps to reverse some of the immune system activity that's been highlighted here – raising hopes for potential treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that going forward the findings from this study will support additional studies … to better predict who will get RA, identify potential biologic targets for preventing RA as well as identify ways to improve treatments," &lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org/news/new-study-reveals-rheumatoid-arthritis-begins-long-before-symptoms-opening-door-to-prevention/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; CU Anschutz rheumatologist Kevin Deane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If part of it is removed or injured, healthy liver cells multiply to rebuild the tissue. This ability is why liver transplants can succeed and why organs like the heart don’t recover the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: years of heavy drinking can rob the liver of this regenerative power. People with alcohol-related hepatitis or advanced cirrhosis develop scarring and liver failure, and sadly, stopping drinking doesn’t always reverse the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared healthy livers with those affected by alcohol damage. They found that liver cells try to switch into repair mode, but get stuck in a half-functioning state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not fully mature liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aren’t becoming the “stem-like” cells needed to regrow tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like being halfway up a ladder—unable to climb up or down. These semi-functional cells add pressure on the remaining healthy cells, causing the liver’s repair system to falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RNA splicing problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every cell uses RNA as instructions to make proteins. In damaged livers, RNA splicing—the process that edits these instructions—is broken. Think of it like trying to edit a movie but putting all the scenes out of order. The result? Proteins that don’t work in the right place, and liver repair grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified ESRP2, a protein that helps with RNA splicing, as missing in damaged liver cells. Without ESRP2, the liver’s “repair instructions” fail, stopping regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm this, researchers studied mice without ESRP2 and found the same type of liver damage seen in humans with alcohol-related liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammation makes it even worse&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol-damaged livers become inflamed. Immune and support cells flood the liver with chemicals that suppress ESRP2, compounding the problem. In lab experiments, blocking one of these inflammatory pathways restored ESRP2 levels and fixed RNA splicing, showing a promising path for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that the liver stops functioning and stops regenerating in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis and cirrhosis, even when a patient has discontinued consuming alcohol, but we didn’t know why,” said U. of I. biochemistry professor Auinash Kalsotra, who co-led the study with Duke University School of Medicine professor Anna Mae Diehl. “The only real life-saving treatment option once a patient reaches the liver failure stage in those diseases is transplantation. But if we understood why these livers were failing, maybe we could intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this could mean for the future&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens doors for new therapies for alcohol-related liver disease.

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing in your 20s or 30s that you carry a gene that will cause your mind and body to slowly unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease is inherited, relentless, and fatal, and there is no cure. Families live with the certainty of decline stretching across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new treatment is being &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro"&gt;widely reported&lt;/a&gt; as a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-gene-therapy-slows-huntingtons-disease-by-75"&gt;Breakthrough Gene Therapy Slows Huntington's Disease by 75%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, gene therapy company uniQure announced that a one-time brain infusion appeared to slow the disease in &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-from-pivotal-phase-i-ii-study-of-amt-130-in-patients-with-huntington-s-disease-1035197551"&gt;a small clinical study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, this would not only be a landmark for Huntington's disease but potentially the first time a gene therapy has shown promise in any adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the results, which were announced in a press release, are early, unreviewed, and based on external comparisons. So, while these findings offer families hope after decades of failure, we need to remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Huntington's disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's is a rare but devastating disease, &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/dementia/dementia-in-aus/contents/what-is-dementia/less-common-dementias"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; around five to ten people in 100,000 in Western countries. That means &lt;a href="https://hdna.com.au/hd-prevalence-study/"&gt;thousands in Australia and hundreds of thousands worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/huntingtons-disease"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; usually start in mid-life. They include involuntary movements,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175825" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, irritability, and progressive decline in thinking and memory. People lose the ability to work, manage money, live independently, and eventually care for themselves. Most die ten to 20 years after onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by an expanded stretch of certain DNA repeats (CAG) in the huntingtin gene. The number of repeats strongly influences when symptoms begin, with longer expansions &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;usually linked&lt;/a&gt; to earlier onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/huntingtons_genes_642-1.jpg" alt="huntington's gene" class="wp-image-175844 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/huntingtons_genes_642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/huntingtons_genes_642-1-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Huntington's disease is caused by repeated sequences in the DNA. (Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking for a treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene that causes Huntington's disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;was identified&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, 32 years ago. Soon afterwards, mouse studies showed that switching off the mutant huntingtin protein even after symptoms had begun could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80623-6"&gt;reverse signs and improve behaviour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggested lowering the toxic protein might slow or even partly reverse the disease. Yet for three decades, every attempt to develop a therapy for people has failed to show convincing clinical benefit. Trials of huntingtin-lowering drugs and other approaches did not slow progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the new treatment?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-time gene therapy, called AMT-130, involves brain surgery guided by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="175825" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;.

(&lt;a href="https://sites.uab.edu/mgraylab/huntingtons-disease/"&gt;University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus carries a short genetic "microRNA" designed to reduce production of the affected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abb8920"&gt;huntingtin protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By delivering it straight into the brain, the treatment bypasses the blood–brain barrier. This natural wall usually prevents medicines from entering the central nervous system. That barrier helps explain why so many brain-targeted drugs have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did they find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 29 patients received treatment, with 12 in each group (one low-dose, and one high-dose) followed for three years. According to uniQure, those given the higher dose declined much slower than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study compared how much participants' movement, thinking, and daily function declined, compared to a matched external group from a global Huntington's registry (meaning they weren't part of the study). The company claimed those given the higher dose had a 75% slowing in their decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a functional scale focused on independence, the &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-from-pivotal-phase-i-ii-study-of-amt-130-in-patients-with-huntington-s-disease-1035197551"&gt;company reported&lt;/a&gt; a 60% slowing in decline for the higher dose group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tests of movement and thinking also favoured treatment. Nerve-cell damage in spinal fluid was lower for study participants than would be expected for untreated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why should we be cautious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are an early snapshot of results reported by the company, not yet peer-reviewed. The study compared treated patients to an external matched control group, not people randomised to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="175825" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. This design can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jncimonographs/lgae046"&gt;introduce bias&lt;/a&gt;. The numbers are also small – only 12 patients at the three-year mark – so we can't draw solid conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reports the therapy was generally well tolerated, with no new serious adverse events related to the drug since late 2022. Most problems were related to the neurosurgical infusion itself, and resolved. But in a disease that already causes such severe symptoms, it is often hard to know what counts as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company uniQure has said it plans to seek regulatory approval in 2026 on the &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-from-pivotal-phase-i-ii-study-of-amt-130-in-patients-with-huntington-s-disease-1035197551"&gt;basis of this dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will face difficult decisions: whether to allow access sooner before all the questions and uncertainties are addressed – based on the needs of a community with no effective options – and wait for further data while people are being treated, or to insist on larger trials that confirm results before approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If upheld, these results represent the first convincing signs that a gene-targeted therapy can slow Huntington's disease. They may also be the first evidence of benefit from a gene therapy in any adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. That would be a milestone after decades of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these results do not prove success. Only larger, longer, and fully peer-reviewed studies will show whether this treatment truly changes lives. Even if approved, a complex neurosurgical gene therapy may not be easily accessible to all patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has said the drug's &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/first-gene-therapy-seems-slow-huntington-disease"&gt;price&lt;/a&gt; would be similar to other gene therapies – which can &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzek4dkyyo"&gt;cost over&lt;/a&gt; A$3 million per patient – and will have the added cost of brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families who carry this gene, the hope is profound. But caution is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may be witnessing the first credible step toward slowing an inherited adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, or just an early signal that may not hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, only time and rigorous science will show whether this treatment delivers the benefits so urgently needed.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266062/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange County Health Care Agency officials on Monday revealed a toddler has been infected with measles, but the virus is not expected to spread because the family isolated as it was contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationally, 1,514 cases of measles have been reported with 23 new ones in the past couple of weeks, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe illness such as pneumonia, brain swelling and even death, especially in young children who are not protected," said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county's health officer. "In recent years, approximately one in eight people diagnosed with measles in the U.S. have required hospitalization. Among children under 5, that number rises to one in five."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, cough, irritated teary eyes and a rash that usually starts on the head. The virus is highly contagious as it spreads through the air and from direct contact with those infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contagiousness starts about four days before a rash and four days after it appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with symptoms is encouraged to call a doctor first before going out because it is so contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the best way to protect from measles is by getting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;UC Irvine epidemiologist Andrew Noymer noted that the toddler who was infected had been traveling domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've had these outbreaks before from a traveler, but it's been an international traveler and now it's a traveler from the U.S. ... It's a sign of the times," Noymer said of recent domestic outbreaks such as in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy is increasing spread of the disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have measles transmission nowadays when we didn't really used to," Noymer said, adding since the early part of the century measles was "eliminated from the Western hemisphere. So COVID-19 has unleashed a wave of vaccine hesitancy and we're seeing that in parents who don't vaccinate their kids against measles."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's not "only a U.S. phenomenon. We're seeing the same thing in Australia, Canada and parts of Europe, which have had measles transmission for some time now.''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But "anyone up to date on their vaccine for measles really doesn't have anything to worry about. It's a very effective vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While "it's unfortunate there's a sick kid in the county and it should be a reminder to all of us to vaccinate our kids it's not really cause for panic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noymer added, "I'll be the first to acknowledge we over promised (the effectiveness) on Covid vaccines and in some ways still over promise on them, but the measles vaccine is really better than your Covid or flu shot, so it's really worth getting."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yogurt is a great source of high-quality protein, with some options having up to 25 grams per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-protein yogurts are usually strained, use ultra-filtered milk or contain whey or plant-based protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose yogurts with little to no added sugar—ideally less than 3 grams per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is one of those foods that can truly do it all. Enjoy it on its own as a high-protein snack, pair it with sweet or savory foods, or use it as a creamy base in smoothies and dips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t stop there—yogurt is full of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D and, of course, protein. What makes it unique is that yogurt protein is digested a little differently than other foods. Thanks to fermentation, its amino acids are more bioavailable, meaning your body can absorb and use them more efficiently.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, protein levels in yogurt can vary widely depending on the style and processing method. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917455/what-is-skyr/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Strained (Greek-style) and skyr yogurts&lt;/a&gt; tend to have more protein than traditional yogurt, while some brands boost their yogurts with added protein sources.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All yogurt naturally contains protein—it comes from milk, after all—but these stand out with an impressive 10 to 25 grams of protein per serving.

To reach that level, Ratio relies on ultra-filtered milk along with added whey protein concentrate.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also a low-sugar option, with just 3 grams of sugar per container; most flavored yogurts have much higher amounts of added sugar.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live and Active Cultures&lt;/strong&gt;. “For gut-health support, look for key words such as ‘live and active cultures’ in the ingredients,” says &lt;a href="https://signup.usenourish.com/providers/claudia-salinas?referralSource=Nourish+dietitian&amp;amp;referralName=Claudia+Salinas&amp;amp;utm_source=Nourish_dietitian&amp;amp;utm_term=Claudia_Salinas&amp;amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae4ao2S8g6VPZOYzubm1yI2vzyQ4sZIOdWHvZ_7dKkjZTiz7mk631f2NiMyAA_aem_pXPrPV1JJ_aKF23JShxzwQ" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Claudia Salinas, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Because heat can destroy beneficial bacteria during processing, this labeling ensures that the yogurt contains at least 10 million CFUs per gram of viable bacteria at the time of manufacturing and no less than 1 million CFUs per gram by the best-by date.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low or No Added Sugars&lt;/strong&gt;. Sugar content can vary widely, with some varieties having up to 20 grams per serving. To keep added sugar low, choose yogurts labeled ‘0 grams of added sugar’ or those with 3 grams or less per serving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat Content&lt;/strong&gt;. While the extra fat can make yogurt more satisfying, it also adds extra calories—especially when paired with toppings like peanut butter, nuts or granola. Choose a fat content that fits within your personal health goals, whether that’s nonfat, low-fat or full-fat varieties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Least 10 Grams of Protein&lt;/strong&gt;. Zenker recommends choosing a yogurt with at least 10 grams of protein to support satiety and muscle repair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is a delicious and nutritious way to boost your protein intake—if you choose wisely. Strained (Greek-style) and skyr yogurts are naturally higher in protein, while some other yogurts increase their protein through ultra-filtered milk or added whey or plant-based protein. For the healthiest choice, dietitians recommended choosing a yogurt that provides at least 10 grams of protein, contains live and active cultures and keeps added sugars to a minimum. &lt;br&gt;

Lead investigator &lt;a href="https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/staff/giovanni-marsicano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Giovanni Marsicano&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt; (UB), supervised the research alongside collaborators in Bordeaux and Moncton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mitochondria-linked-to-energy"&gt;Mitochondria linked to energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside each neuron, mitochondria convert nutrients and oxygen into ATP, the cell’s spendable energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reaction, called oxidative phosphorylation, keeps electrical signals firing and helps keep memory circuits stable, and it is already a focus of clinical &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01839-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also see energy shortfalls early in diseases like Alzheimer’s, well before many neurons die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large human &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abk1051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; showed widespread cellular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction across the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;Alzheimer’s brain&lt;/a&gt;, consistent with early bioenergetic failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it was hard to tell if failing mitochondria cause &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-molecules-unexpectedly-store-their-own-memory/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; loss or simply show up as collateral damage. The new work attacks that question directly by turning the organelle up, then watching behavior change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-switch-for-cellular-power"&gt;New switch for cellular power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team built on chemogenetic tools called &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)00065-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DREADDs&lt;/a&gt; that let scientists turn engineered receptors on with a lab-made drug and leave everything else alone, a method well known in neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They redesigned a stimulatory receptor so it sits on mitochondria, then named it mitoDREADD-Gs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When activated, this receptor triggers &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK518966/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;G proteins&lt;/a&gt; inside the organelle to kickstart energy production. The design lets researchers press a precise biochemical button without changing thousands of other cellular parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning on mitoDREADD-Gs rapidly raised mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption in brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, the switch boosted intramitochondrial &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3870303/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cAMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33167377/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PKA&lt;/a&gt;, a pathway known to tune respiration from within the organelle, as shown by classic cell biology &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2684673/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results-of-the-study"&gt;Results of the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group first tested a known form of amnesia triggered by tetrahydrocannabinol, the active compound in cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That impairment relies on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabinoid receptors&lt;/a&gt; located on mitochondria in the memory center, the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mitoDREADD-Gs turned on in hippocampal neurons, the THC-induced recognition memory deficit (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9855787/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RMD&lt;/a&gt;) disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals explored the new object again, a simple behavioral readout tied to long-term memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then moved to disease models. Mice that model frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, both showing early hippocampal bioenergetic defects, recovered recognition memory when their mitochondrial activity was temporarily boosted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration,” explained Marsicano&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-memory-and-mitochondria"&gt;Human memory and mitochondria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a hub for forming and stabilizing long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-does-the-human-brain-create-retrieve-memories-engram-cells-connections/"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt;. It depends on a steady ATP supply to maintain synaptic strength during the hours after learning, when fragile traces become durable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy deficits hit this process hard. If oxidative phosphorylation slows, neurotransmission weakens, plasticity fades, and cells compensate poorly, especially in aging or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tool increased assembly and activity of complex I in the respiratory chain, a bottleneck for electron entry that shapes ATP output. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That local, reversible boost was enough to normalize behavior in two distinct dementia models, a strong sign that bioenergetics sit upstream of the memory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-does-not-prove-yet"&gt;What it does not prove yet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments were done in mice and used viral delivery of engineered receptors alongside a designer drug. That is not a therapy for people, and safety would need rigorous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short bursts of extra respiration helped, but constant stimulation may carry risk. Excess energy flux can increase reactive oxygen species, strain quality control, and stress vulnerable neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings therefore map a mechanism and a target, not a ready-to-use treatment. Any clinical translation would need careful dosing windows, specific &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; regions, and long-term monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neurons-mitochondria-and-memory"&gt;Neurons, mitochondria, and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many current approaches try to coax cells to make more mitochondria, ship healthy mitochondria into damaged tissue, or scavenge oxidative byproducts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews highlight growing tests of such strategies in animals and early trials in several diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study offers a different angle, a way to tune the existing power plants quickly and locally inside neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By working with endogenous signaling, it avoids permanent genomic edits and keeps the intervention reversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will probe how long the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-pupil-dilation-to-brains-working-memory-levels/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; rescue can last, which cell types drive the effect, and whether similar bioenergetic tuning could help other cognitive domains beyond recognition memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answers continue to line up, mitochondria could shift from bystanders to central targets in the fight against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02032-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 03:14:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNMFhzLTVBYk5WU29uOTRyZE1icFREbkZ2N0hVM0dZQVFvV3U0Y3M3V19jU2pselJ2Rl9QWHZTVFdnTmt3S1lrN3hEOGZoN1VrenAxUVJsT01sbmRQYXBTcWpPTm9DV0hxeWVfaURzYldKdW9PY1FCZnJpQUZZMG1nYmNTSTJLZWlmeTBtVjMtYTlOOC1FTVE</guid></item><item><title>研究发现99 ％的心脏病发作，中风病例与“可改变”的风险有关- upi.com</title><link>https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/09/29/study-heart-attack-stroke-risks/3161759197171/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers found 99% of participants in&lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/journal/jacc" target="_blank"&gt; the study&lt;/a&gt; -- published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology -- had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, elevated blood sugar or had used tobacco leading up to a cardiac event. High blood pressure was the most common issue. All four risk factors are preventable and can be managed, the study said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 600,000 cases in South Korea and another 1,000 adults in the United States were tracked for up to 20 years. Participants were monitored for blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose and smoke exposure. High blood pressure affected more than 95% of South Korean participants and over 93% of U.S. participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is important because high blood pressure is fairly easily detectable but it is asymptomatic, so often overlooked," the study's senior author Philip Greenland, professor of preventative medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heart-attack-stroke-heart-failure-linked-to-preventable-risk-factors#What-are-the-4-major-cardiovascular-risk-factors" target="_blank"&gt;told Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;. "Our findings show how important it is to recognize it and treat it."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.109.192703" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, blood pressure over 120/80 should be treated, as should fasting glucose of 100 milligrams per deciliter or more. Total cholesterol of 200 mg/DL or more is another "major risk factor," according to Greenland, who added other "risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like genetics or certain blood markers, are not modifiable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most doctors recommend monitoring blood pressure and repeating lab work at each appointment -- depending on age and health history -- maintaining a good weight, eating well and getting plenty of sleep and exercise also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In brief, as we have known for many years, there are a small number of modifiable risk factors for heart disease, and at least one, but often more than one, are present in the background leading up to heart attacks, heart failure or strokes," said Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Patients should be sure that these four factors are assessed at every medical visit, and if there is even a slight elevation as per our paper, efforts need to be made to treat that factor to prevent heart attack, stroke or heart failure."&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study shows that vitamin D2 may reduce vitamin D3 levels, suggesting D3 is the more effective supplement for immune and overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-surrey/"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/john-innes-centre/"&gt;John Innes Centre&lt;/a&gt;, and the Quadram Institute Bioscience suggests that taking vitamin D2 may actually lower the body’s levels of vitamin D3, which is considered the more effective form of the nutrient. Many people use vitamin D supplements to maintain bone strength, support the immune system, and follow the UK government’s advice of 10 micrograms (µg) per day, particularly during the colder months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is available in two main supplement forms: D2 and D3. The researchers observed that when individuals take vitamin D2, it can cause a decline in vitamin D3 levels. Unlike D2, vitamin D3 is the type that the body naturally makes when exposed to sunlight, and it is also the form most efficient at boosting overall vitamin D status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, are based on an analysis of randomized controlled trials. The results showed that people taking vitamin D2 experienced reduced vitamin D3 levels compared with those who did not take D2 supplements. In several cases, vitamin D3 levels dropped even lower than in the study’s control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Brown, PhD Research Fellow and Lead Researcher of the study from the University of Surrey’s Nutrition, Exercise, Chronobiology &amp;amp; Sleep Discipline, said: “Vitamin D supplements are important, especially between October and March, when our bodies cannot make vitamin D from sunlight in the UK. However, we discovered that vitamin D2 supplements can actually decrease levels of vitamin D3 in the body, which is a previously unknown effect of taking these supplements. This study suggests that, subject to personal considerations, vitamin D3 supplements may be more beneficial for most individuals over vitamin D2.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Cathie Martin, Group Leader at the John Innes Centre, said: “This meta-analysis highlights the importance of ensuring plant-based vitamin D3 is accessible in the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;D2 and D3: Not Interchangeable&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research supports a previous study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.790444/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, led by Professor Colin Smith from the University of Surrey, which suggests that vitamin D2 and D3 do not have identical roles in supporting immune function. Vitamin D3 has a modifying effect on the immune system that could fortify the body against viral and bacterial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Colin Smith said: “We have shown that vitamin D3, but not vitamin D2, appears to stimulate the type I interferon signalling system in the body – a key part of the immune system that provides a first line of defense against bacteria and viruses. Thus, a healthy vitamin D3 status may help prevent viruses and bacteria from gaining a foothold in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research into the different functionalities of vitamin D2 and D3 should be a priority in deciding whether vitamin D3 should be the first-line choice of vitamin D supplement, subject to individual requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Martin Warren, Chief Scientific Officer at the Quadram Institute, said: “Vitamin D deficiency represents a significant public health concern, especially during the winter months, with significant deficiency across the UK population. This collaborative research effort aligns well with the Quadram Institute’s mission to deliver healthier lives through food innovation to enhance the nutrient density of the food we eat. Tackling this with the most effective form of vitamin D supplementation or fortification is of the utmost importance to the health of the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
