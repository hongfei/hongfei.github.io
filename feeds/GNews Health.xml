                                        &lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study has revealed that babies as young as four months old are capable of forming memories, despite being unable to recall them later in life. Researchers used brain scans to capture memory formation in 26 infants, ranging from 4 to 24 months old. The study found that the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with emotions and memory, is active in babies when they form memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt7570"&gt;researchers showed&lt;/a&gt; the babies a series of images and then tested their memory recall by displaying familiar and new images side by side. The study found that older infants (12-24 months) exhibited activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region involved in memory-related decision-making and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We showed infants photographs of faces, objects, and scenes one at a time during fMRI. Shortly afterward, we tested their memory by showing each of these now-familiar photographs alongside a new image of the same type. If the infant looked longer at the photograph they had seen before, we labelled that image as remembered; otherwise, it was forgotten," &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/you-dont-remember-being-a-baby-but-your-brain-was-making-memories/"&gt;said the lead author &lt;/a&gt;of the study Dr Nick Turk-Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that infants can create memories after brief experiences, with clearer effects after 12 months. The findings support the idea that people store memories as infants that they can't access later. However, questions remain about the duration and complexity of these memories. The research also raises deeper questions about why people can't recall memories from before age 4-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding infant memory can provide insights into language acquisition, developmental disorders, and early education. It may also shed light on memory loss in ageing and diseases like Alzheimer's. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms behind infant memory and its implications for human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    &lt;/div&gt;

When the swelling didn’t go down, she eventually went to a foot doctor, who thought the problem might be vascular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;About that time, her parents needed help clear across the country, so she put it on the back burner, but as she drove out to help her parents, her entire right leg swelled up into her groin and lower abdomen. Clearly not a foot problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Her family doctor suspected lymphedema, a diagnosis an ultrasound later confirmed. She had a malady few people know about, including many doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s not that it’s uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="2041" data-height="3000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/UWKV54ISJVGJ7MU3NFYY2XUKAE.jpg?auth=e34f8642dbaa5735203d0043b9685a430cc09ed0867a1a6251048d039b65256a&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1175" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/UWKV54ISJVGJ7MU3NFYY2XUKAE.jpg?auth=e34f8642dbaa5735203d0043b9685a430cc09ed0867a1a6251048d039b65256a&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2350 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ashley Hodge’s foot is still swollen with lymphedema after months of treatment including compression dressings, manual lymphatic massages and sequential pneumatic compression. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Ashley Hodge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/documents/LERN_Resource_Guide_Download.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Lymphatic Education &amp;amp; Research Network&lt;/a&gt; (LE&amp;amp;RN) reports up to 10 million people in the U.S. alone suffer from lymphedema and lymphatic diseases and that’s likely an undercount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s more than from multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s and AIDS combined. Seven million of those cases are related to cancer and its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Col. Susan Fondy, an Army flight surgeon whose 20-year career culminated with a three-year assignment as the chief surgeon of the Army National Guard before she retired to Frederick, Maryland, said when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she took a LE&amp;amp;RN eight-hour course designed for medical professionals “and learned a ton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She was told the “weird tightness” in her armpit within a couple of weeks of cancer surgery was normal. When it turned into full-blown lymphedema, she realized how little the medical community knows about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="2400" data-height="3000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IW3CRWFBKBDATPPLYCO2PILU7M.jpg?auth=8983199b8d52c376d14b4062718929fe04913e45234b2fdb7496a6510a1720ae&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1000" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IW3CRWFBKBDATPPLYCO2PILU7M.jpg?auth=8983199b8d52c376d14b4062718929fe04913e45234b2fdb7496a6510a1720ae&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2000 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Retired Col. Susan Fondy, a flight surgeon who did four tours in the military, developed lymphedema after cancer. While lymphedema is not deadly, it can be miserable and she said her medical school training spent 15 minutes on the topic. She was stunned to learn how little most doctors know about the condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| U.S. Army Official Photo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said when she was in medical school, lymphedema was about a 15-minute discussion, despite how often it afflicts people. Including her. Her own cancer was found at the end of her fourth deployment — “ one of those welcome home, you have cancer kind of things.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-cancer-'souvenir'" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A cancer ‘souvenir’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tissue swells when protein-rich fluid that’s supposed to drain through the lymphatic system instead accumulates, sometimes in shocking amounts. Google the condition and there are photos of legs as big as normal torsos or ankles grown to the size of cantaloupes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Risk depends in part on the type of cancer. Seventy percent of head or neck cancer survivors will develop lymphedema that can entirely alter their appearance. Lymphedema will impact 30% of breast cancer patients, 30% of sarcoma patients, 20% of those with gynecological cancer, 16% with melanoma and 10% with genital urinary cancer. All forms of cancer treatment, including for prostate cancer, can lead to lymphedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There’s also a rare inherited form, different from the acquired, “secondary” lymphedema that can happen to anyone at any age, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537239/#:~:text=Epidemiology,%2C%20external%2C%20or%20combined%20lymphedema." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Swelling can occur in arms, hands, legs, feet, breast, chest, shoulder, pelvis, groin, genitals and face/mouth tissues. It can steal range of motion and discolor skin or cause pain, and alter sensation and limb heaviness. Sometimes clothes no longer fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Actress Kathy Bates survived both ovarian and breast cancer and became a spokesperson for LE&amp;amp;RN. She calls the condition a “souvenir of cancer” that is “chronic, debilitating and currently permanent swelling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/video-library/cdc-kathy-bates-and-lymphedema" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/video-library/cdc-kathy-bates-and-lymphedema"&gt;In a video&lt;/a&gt;, she tells people with cancer to ask their medical team how it plans to reduce the risk of lymphedema during cancer treatment. She also tells them to learn the early signs, which include tingling and slight heaviness. Lymphedema is not deadly, though it can lead to infections that can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It is instead frustrating, disruptive, uncomfortable and incurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Hitting-brakes-on-research" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Hitting brakes on research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Lymphedema is a stark example of what happens when medical research is deprioritized, advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;William Repicci, president and CEO of LE&amp;amp;RN, sighs heavily as he discusses the roller coaster that has been research funding for lymphedema and other lymphatic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Getting funding for research has been like clinging to a coaster’s rails with your fingers and toes and inching forward manually, then jumping into the car at the top, only to plunge to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, researchers at the biannual Lymphatic Forum that LE&amp;amp;RN hosts said their grants had been canceled. Others said all research funding to their universities had been held up since March or April; whether it will be released is unknown. If money’s not released by August, research programs will start to close, Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Studying lymphedema provides insight into other diseases with lymphatic system ties, including diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Repicci said. “So when we pull back from research, it’s not just a matter of ignoring the needs of those people who have incurable lymphedema or the tens of thousands of children born with lymphatic malformations. It goes much further than that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For lymphedema research funding, the hits just kept on coming. LE&amp;amp;RN had lobbied hard to be part of the CDC’s Chronic Disease Education and Awareness program, which gets a lot of the public health giant’s attention. Their three-year grant resulted in more than 500 people a day visiting their virtual resource center to learn how to talk to their family and doctors about the disease. In October 2024, LE&amp;amp;RN was approved for a three-year extension if funds became available. To date, no money has been forthcoming and the group struggles to find outside funding to keep the program operating. The president’s budget for the coming year has zeroed out the program entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Advocates also managed to get lymphedema research included on the list that Congress puts together for the Department of Defense peer review medical research program by showing that lymphedema disproportionately impacts people in the military, “especially by pointing out that, thanks to the burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, where service members were inhaling toxic fumes, they were coming down with a whole host of diseases. At the top of the list was head and neck cancer, which results in lymphedema in over 70% of patients,” Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For two years, the research was funded, resulting in $12 million in lymphatic and lymphedema research grants. The program funding was then cut by more than half, while dozens of new diseases cut from other programs were added to the list eligible for funding. The result was twice as many diseases and half the funding, Repicci said. Neither lymphedema nor lymphatic diseases made the list for the fiscal 2025 budget, so researchers can’t even apply for the funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This year when lymphatic diseases mysteriously dropped from the list it was really shocking,” Fondy said, adding it wouldn’t cost any extra to add it back on. “It’s just a matter of letting our researchers compete with other researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2174"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FTNL754M4FH4PJLMGDSUJCC5NQ.JPG?auth=95d779daf8f67333aaac0e07df17484ac64b6db14bcadc5912ab5803f3264ad6&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=579" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FTNL754M4FH4PJLMGDSUJCC5NQ.JPG?auth=95d779daf8f67333aaac0e07df17484ac64b6db14bcadc5912ab5803f3264ad6&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1158 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Kirsten Fox poses for photos at her home near Park City on Saturday, July 12, 2025. She is among millions of Americans with lymphedema, a condition causing painful swelling. She developed lymphedema as a side effect of surgery following breast cancer, though it can also result from other causes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Scott G Winterton, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Other research funding has also been cut or is now very shaky, Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Congress had asked the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to create the National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases to study improving the prognosis for lymphatic diseases and to learn more about them. Work began last year, but there have been no official meetings this year. Repicci thinks the panel is determined to release its report, even with no further meetings, but “I fear no matter what it says, my ability to lobby to fund any of the kinds of changes that are in there has greatly diminished,” he said, despite bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The sense at this point from both sides is that an example is going to be made of Health and Human Services, and there’s nothing we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Almost-anyone's-disease" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Almost anyone’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While breast cancer accounts for the most cancer cases, lymphedema’s not a women’s disease. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=About%20313%2C780%20new%20cases%20of,do%20not%20die%20from%20it." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; reports roughly 1 in 8 men will at some point develop prostate cancer. After treatment, lymphedema can occur in the legs, groin or scrotum. Men and children also suffer from lymphedema either through cancer or because they are born with it or for hereditary reasons. Melanoma is one reason members of the military are hit so hard by lymphedema, because they spend so much of their time unprotected outside. Melanoma rates are much higher in the military than in the broader population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;People can get lymphedema as well from a bad car accident, surgical trauma, a groin hernia surgery, said Dr. Fatma Tuncer, a lymphedema specialist and plastic surgeon at Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. The origin of some cases remains unknown. Long-term studies suggest it can take 10 years to manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Most of the time, the issue is quality of life,” she said. “People have jobs, careers, hobbies they can’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1067" data-height="1600"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CIPVEIAGTZGANF5TV5V5DVEKJQ.jpg?auth=1bd72a3d9702cbd6fe9c3f33a7f1456134921f9bc6b87198e10d62a5fa523a24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1199" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CIPVEIAGTZGANF5TV5V5DVEKJQ.jpg?auth=1bd72a3d9702cbd6fe9c3f33a7f1456134921f9bc6b87198e10d62a5fa523a24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2398 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ashley Hodges, holding baby, at her daughter’s wedding.

Patients with chronic lymphedema for a decade or more risk developing lymphangiosarcoma — a highly aggressive tumor that may require amputation of the involved extremity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Treating-lymphedema" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Treating lymphedema&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Managing lymphedema can take hours daily, including donning compression garments, being vigilant about skin care, doing self-lymph draining or using a pneumatic compression device, as well as special exercises to remove fluid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2971"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/QZQATABMYFHPNEPC2KJ4QU7BKE.jpg?auth=acbfa259e2c9fc4442e084d521afe5e5a96a04f668341f21084ff3a9d22fa229&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=792" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/QZQATABMYFHPNEPC2KJ4QU7BKE.jpg?auth=acbfa259e2c9fc4442e084d521afe5e5a96a04f668341f21084ff3a9d22fa229&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1584 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jeffrey “Doc” Hodges does a light massage to help manually drain the lymphedema from Ashley Hodge’s leg. She uses a combination of compression, dressings, manual lymphatic massages and sequential pneumatic compression to try to control the accumulation of fluid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Ashley Hodges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Few know that better than Fondy, who wears compression garments all the time. Lymphedema, she said, is “one of those things that profoundly affects my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Huntsman Cancer Institute is designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center of Excellence in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Lymphatic Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“At Huntsman Cancer Institute, we offer a spectrum of surgeries, use state of the art imagery, and offer care from our certified lymphedema therapists to provide patients the best lymphedema treatment possible,” said Tuncer, who is also an assistant professor of surgery at the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said most people first hear the word when it’s diagnosed. While some patients have mild cases, others may be hospitalized for infection and even end up in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The main treatment is massaging where fluid builds up, and once the fluid goes down, compression garments to keep the fluid from building up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When surgery was first suggested as a possible solution, it was met with doubt. Fondy said there’s no medication to treat it. Surgery can provide relief, but surgeons are often overworked and booked seven months to a year out. A lot of the lymphedema therapists don’t even recommend surgery because there are so few plastic surgeons trained to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Patients should not expect a cure from surgery, “which is not perfect,” Tuncer added. But it can help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Some of Tuncer’s older patients have arthritis and can’t put their garments on. She would also love to see lighter garments developed. And garments don’t help everyone. Head and neck cancer treatments are especially problematic because there is no way to use compression safely. Those patients have few options to manage it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tuncer emphasized the need to avoid infection. That’s something Kirsten Fox, 62, knows about firsthand. In 2014, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, the Park City, Utah, woman had a double mastectomy. Because of the family history, the cancer, which was in both breasts, was detected fairly early, but during surgery cancer was found in multiple lymph nodes and 10 were removed on one side, the rest radiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had a little lymphedema after surgery. Hers isn’t out of control like some get, but it impacted her job and thus her livelihood. Her arm was wrapped in something akin to a cast. She started seeing a lymphedema therapist for full lymph drainage. That included relatively light massages every six to eight weeks. Then she bumped her arm in July 2023. The skin didn’t break, but she developed great pain, got flushed and felt loopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the emergency room, doctors said she had cellulitis, a serious infection that’s common with lymphedema. “I’ve never been so terrified,” she told Deseret News. “And I’ve been in a plane crash.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had to pause lymphedema massage therapy for a month to ensure the infection was all gone; she worried about pushing it around in her arm, which was very swollen and painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;At Huntsman, a lymphovenous bypass surgery was the recommendation. A plastic surgeon takes the lymph tube and dumps it into the nearest vein, then sews it in. That helps the lymphatic fluid drain from the limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The surgery wasn’t covered by her insurance, a decision she said was later overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now she sees her lymphatic therapist weekly. And she also does self-massage and uses light therapy. She’s careful not to bonk her funny bone. And she wears long sleeves to mask the difference in the size of her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 23:18:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOOElPdjY5aG9LaEdIRHFTSnVIS1ZmNXRwQ1JRYmtIeW42VnY0Mk1RaGZjN0tMWUwtUm8yZ0cwQ0lGNWZUYmN2WXlHSHlQUTd2Q09ISEZlbWhpNXlZcHhCNWxlbV9PeDdmMDNRQkIyd2NTVVRHakNKYkx2ckc3ZlM0XzVZUTJsdVI5R3NKMTA3UEdOVm1LbFlOeGItNkFpaHZhZFlXYVlKaw</guid></item><item><title>重磅研究中的休克自闭症和阿尔茨海默氏症的联系-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdzVBaVJnZkpfUHZESWxFckNIOEFlLXcydkdUbzIxUk9RR1p6ekY3cE1iR2hiSE9wMS1mNzJpWmprVEFkNEZ2R29OU25KdEo1Zkd2aGxSS2dQU3labnlEZEpkNDM2VzNXdGhwT1ZqTW9HelBzZkZ0UjJvZEkxOXVIT1IwREgza3ZCZ21JV1JwVzB3blpC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exposure to a toxic metal as far back as childhood could raise the risk of developing dementia later in life, a first-of-its-kind study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-79b5ebf0-6af6-11f0-b9c0-3167b0ebb072"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; studied more than 600,000 older US adults who were exposed as children to high levels of lead, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14706935/popular-toothpaste-toxic-metals-linked-autism.html"&gt;toxic metal linked to autism, infertility and cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people who grew up in the 1960s and 70s - when the use of lead in gasoline and paint was commonplace and unregulated - were 20 percent more likely to have memory issues later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These memory issues could develop into mild cognitive decline, a precursor to several forms of dementia, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-3d1f8ec0-6c05-11f0-8c8f-41c7c211c652" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease - the most common form which affects nearly 7 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, nearly nine in 10 Americans growing up at the time had 'dangerously high' levels of lead in their blood, suggesting damning long-term consequences for older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, unveiled at the world's largest dementia conference this week in Toronto, suggests the exposure is likely tied to leaded gasoline, which took nearly two decades to be phased out of cars sold in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the metal still lurks in older houses, meaning younger generations could face the same dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional US-based studies revealed at the conference found even small levels of lead exposure could lead to more amyloid and tau plaques - which cause Alzheimer's disease - forming in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lead exposure dating to childhood could increase the risk of memory issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maria C Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead of the Alzheimer's Association, who was not involved in the studies, said: 'Research suggests half the US population - more than 170 million people - were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research sheds more light on the toxicity of lead related to brain health in older adults today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results come as nearly 9 million adults in the US are living with some sort of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first study, from researchers at the University of Toronto, looked at approximately 600,000 US adults sourced from the American Community Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants, all over the age of 65, were exposed to historically atmospheric levels of lead (HALL) between 1960 and 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not analyze the source of the lead but believe that a higher density of automobile traffic, such as in urban areas, was the main contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team determined that 17 to 22 percent of people living in areas with moderate, high or extremely high atmospheric lead reported memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translated to a 20 percent increased risk of memory problems compared to those without high lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Eric Brown, lead study author and associate chief of geriatric psychiatry at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, said: 'Our study may help us understand the pathways that contribute to some people developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When lead enters the body, it travels through the bloodstream and spreads to vital organs, including the brain. Once there, it infiltrates cells responsible for nutrients like calcium and iron, causing permanent damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no safe level of lead, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, lead was added to paint, pipes and even some children's toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted it was also used in gasoline to improve performance, and the process to phase it out did not start until 1975. It took roughly 20 years to fully remove lead from gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Esme Fuller-Thomson, senior study author and professor at the University of Toronto, said: 'When I was a child in 1976, our blood carried 15 times more lead than children's blood today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An astonishing 88 percent of us had levels higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter, which are now considered dangerously high.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned while atmospheric lead levels have decreased, the metal can still be found in older homes without updated paint or pipes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, roughly 38 million homes throughout the country (one in four) were built prior to lead paint bans and may still contain the paint on windowsills, doorframes, stairs, railings, porches and fences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EPA also estimates there are still about 9 million lead pipes in use across the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brown urged those who have been exposed to atmospheric lead to focus on reducing other risk factors for dementia, including high blood pressure, smoking and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers tied high lead exposure to gasoline used in the 1960s and '70s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional study presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that older adults who live within three miles of a lead-releasing facility were more likely to have memory and thinking issues than those who lived further away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These facilities include those that manufacture glass, mixed concrete or computers and other electronics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of California, Davis, assessed 2,379 older patients who had an average age of 74. All lived in California and were taken from two studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to two years earlier, participants who lived three miles from a lead-releasing facility scored lower on verbal episodic memory tests - recalling personal experiences - and overall cognition than those who lived further away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And every three miles farther a participant lived from one of these facilities, their memory scores improved an additional five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kathryn Conlon, senior study author and associate professor of environmental epidemiology at UC Davis, said: 'Our results indicate that lead exposure in adulthood could contribute to worse cognitive performance within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite tremendous progress on lead abatement, studies have shown there is no safe level of exposure - and half of US children have detectable levels of lead in their blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Conlon also found there were 7,507 lead-releasing facilities in the US in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce exposure, she said people living nearby should keep their homes clean to avoid the accumulation of lead-contaminated dust, remove their shoes when coming inside and place dust mats inside and outside to avoid tracking contaminated dust indoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows populations served by drinking water with the highest levels of lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third study from Purdue University exposed human brain cells to lead in zero, 15 and 50 parts per billion, simulating the kind of lead exposure people might experience through contaminated water or air. The EPA's action level for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found neurons were more electrically active than those with no exposure, suggesting early signs of cognitive dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was also an increase in amyloid and tau proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Junkai Xie, lead study author and post-doctoral research associate in chemical engineering at Purdue University, said: 'Our results show that lead exposure isn't just a short-term concern; it may set the stage for cognitive problems decades later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  The Lancet Commission on liver cancer found that most cases were preventable if &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/21/alcohol-cancer-risks-warning-labels-charities-say" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, fatty liver disease and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/27/scientists-warn-90-of-hepatitis-b-sufferers-remain-unaware-of-silent-killer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;levels of viral hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; B and C were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission set out several recommendations for policymakers, which it estimated could reduce the incidence of liver cancer cases by 2% to 5% each year by 2050, preventing 9m to 17m new cases of liver cancer and saving 8 million to 15 million lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/obesity","type":"Keyword","title":"Obesity"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"politics/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/hepatitis-b","type":"Keyword","title":"Hepatitis B"},{"id":"society/hepatitis-c","type":"Keyword","title":"Hepatitis C"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/rachel-hall","type":"Contributor","title":"Rachel Hall","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/17/Rachel_Hall.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ebf88b36e5b5ece33a2d5bb1bf844d50","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/17/Rachel_Hall_Next_Gen.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=19a035691b77985e87f022431bae5766"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/jul/28/lifestyle-changes-and-vaccination-could-prevent-most-liver-cancer-cases","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Jian Zhou at Fudan University in China, who led the research, said: “Liver cancer is a growing health issue around the world. It is one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with five-year survival rates ranging from approximately 5% to 30%. We risk seeing close to a doubling of cases and deaths from liver cancer over the next quarter of a century without urgent action to reverse this trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. The number of deaths is predicted to grow from 760,000 in 2022 to 1.37 million in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Previous analyses have predicted that the number of new liver cancer cases will nearly double from 870,000 in 2022 to 1.52m in 2050, mostly due to population growth and ageing populations, with the largest increases expected in Africa. At present, more than 40% of the global liver cancer cases occur in China due to its relatively high rates of hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the fastest growing causes of liver cancer globally is fatty liver disease, and this is expected to rise because of increasing rates of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One-third of the global population is estimated to have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) – previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where fat builds up in a person’s liver – though it can be prevented by eating a balanced diet, being physically active and potentially losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Only 20% to 30% of people with MASLD go on to develop the more severe form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to liver cancer. The commission said the proportion of liver cancer cases associated with MASH was projected to increase from 8% in 2022 to 11% in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The second fastest growing cause is alcohol, with associated liver cases projected to increase from 19% in 2022 to 21% in 2050. In contrast, the proportion of liver cancer cases linked to hepatitis B is expected to decrease from 39% in 2022 to 37% in 2050, while hepatitis C-related cases are projected to drop from 29% to 26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission author Prof Hashem B El-Serag of Baylor College of Medicine in the US said: “Liver cancer was once thought to occur mainly in patients with viral hepatitis or alcohol-related liver disease. However, today, rising rates of obesity are an increasing risk factor for liver cancer, primarily due to the increase in cases of excess fat around the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission’s recommendations included that governments boost HBV vaccination and implement universal screening for adults; introduce minimum alcohol unit pricing and sugar taxes along with warning labels; invest in early detection of liver damage and cancer; and improve palliative care for sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission author Prof Valérie Paradis of Beaujon hospital in France said: “There is an urgent need to raise awareness within society about the severity of the growing health issue of rising liver cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Compared with other cancers, liver cancer is very hard to treat but has more distinct risk factors, which help define specific prevention strategies. With joint and continuous efforts, we believe many liver cancer cases can be prevented, and both the survival and quality of patients with liver cancer will be considerably improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matt Hoare, an associate professor in hepatology at the University of Cambridge’s Early &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute, said liver cancer was “unlike many other cancers” in that the death rate was still rising, with the causes varying by region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He said public health policy changes have proven effective, since Japan had successfully reduced its death rate by implementing preventive policies and improving detection to find cancers earlier. His team is seeking to identify new ways to spot patients with liver disease who will develop cancer through DNA sequencing of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPVlFmSVh0dFNmdWRaZnFTbkl5dk11U2MwTTJHYnBlemE1S0U1ZVFqNHBTUi1tcW9nS2ZyZ3ZWVFh1NFJ5cGh5eUIxcUVJSFY2bDlqUVl1NmtiQzdzU1htRFZwN0lhZzRUQmZVZk5FeDZwWk9NZkFwYlVpNV8yUWw0cHBqR1l3V2FpdkxpZzMwTS1kQlpBX2dCVjZvandzaGQzaWRKY1U1dmFDeWRXZEF5akhQNDNTVWNCRWhv</guid></item><item><title>万步迷思：这是您真正需要的-德撒律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxONnNHUHgyRTNsN0RRaE5BeUtWZGNTMTZCTEJEcU1XMUtTakhhWjJMNXRDR1lOQzF6cXFmTV9mZHpNTk0zZDV3bGpUaGtZZC1ZYk5faHhGRXNHbzNucl8zQjdxNE11bm41RVBTMzZHVElNTWxZbDFRSUR1NEhoUEpnS0ZrLTNkazJoVC1qY2ZLazlYcXNSdFNlTGFzZXZvX2cxLUFJUjZkbUJEVFVCQXNySg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests walking 7,000 steps daily offers the same health benefits as 10,000 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking a minimum of 7,000 steps can minimize the risk of early death by 47%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 daily steps is linked to significant health gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Take a walk, 10,000-step goal. A new study says you might be too demanding when it comes to boosting health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Research from the University of Sydney shows that walking at least 7,000 steps a day offers about the same health benefits as the widely touted 10,000 steps we’ve heard about for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just 7,000 steps a day can reduce the risk of premature death by up to 47%, per the study in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home"&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The study focused on how much impact different daily step counts had on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The team also examined the relationship between walking a certain number of steps and the risk of developing various diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Aiming for 7,000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn’t been looked at before,” said professor Melody Ding, who led the study. “However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7,000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts — such as increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain," she said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes, including reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and depressive symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study's-mechanics" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study’s mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study by researchers at the University of Sydney looked at data from nearly five dozen studies conducted between 2014 and 2025 in more than 10 countries, including the U.S., Australia, United Kingdom and Japan. It is the “largest and most comprehensive review to date,” per the researchers from the university’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers used pedometers, accelerometers and other fitness trackers to see how far study participants walked each day. Beginning with 2,000 steps, experts compared the health outcomes, looking at 1,000-step increments to see if the numbers made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the news release, compared to 2,000 steps a day, they found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking 7,000 steps a day reduced risk of death by 47% — almost identical to the benefit of walking 10,000 steps per day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia risk dropped by 38% at 7,000 steps a day, with just a 7% extra reduction at 10,000 steps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk of type 2 diabetes fell by 22% from walking 10,000 steps a day and reduced to 27% at 12,000 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Significant health improvements were seen when people increased their average daily steps from 2,000 to between 5,000 and 7,000 steps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That doesn’t mean you should slow down if you’re already hitting the 10,000-step benchmark, said Dr. Katherine Owen, co-author and the study’s chief analyst. But she added that the health benefits of the extra steps are “modest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Ding said the study “helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More study is needed to see if set goals should vary based on age, health status and region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="10000-steps-a-made-up-number" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;10,000 steps a made-up number&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study is not the first to say 10,000 steps isn’t really scientific when it comes to health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://in.nau.edu/ucan/myth-debunked-10000-steps-a-day-is-required-for-good-health/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://in.nau.edu/ucan/myth-debunked-10000-steps-a-day-is-required-for-good-health/"&gt;Northern Arizona University&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2023, the number has been ingrained for years, but it’s not like a scientific study declared that a magic number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Rather it can be traced more than 60 years back to Japan, when a marketing campaign for a pedometer called the “manpo-kei” gave the notion the patina of settled fact. “Manpo-kei” means “10,000 steps meter.” And it was chosen because it was “catchy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The 2023 release notes other things to consider when raising or evaluating your activity level, including your own fitness level, intensity — which is needed to boost heart health — as an amble doesn’t do much, and what kind of health outcome you want to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the article, “Research suggests that moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 150 minutes a week or vigorous-intensity activity for 75 minutes a week is a helpful benchmark for cardiovascular health — regardless of the number of steps. This can provide a gentle guide of what to shoot for, however, it’s best to focus on your own individual starting point and increase gradually from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 21:06:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxONnNHUHgyRTNsN0RRaE5BeUtWZGNTMTZCTEJEcU1XMUtTakhhWjJMNXRDR1lOQzF6cXFmTV9mZHpNTk0zZDV3bGpUaGtZZC1ZYk5faHhGRXNHbzNucl8zQjdxNE11bm41RVBTMzZHVElNTWxZbDFRSUR1NEhoUEpnS0ZrLTNkazJoVC1qY2ZLazlYcXNSdFNlTGFzZXZvX2cxLUFJUjZkbUJEVFVCQXNySg</guid></item><item><title>OHSU研究表明，长期COVID可能比以前认为的更常见- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I3DOFOD4KNDSBPH2SPIADTHISI"&gt;New research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University suggests that long-term effects of COVID-19 may be far more common and slower to appear than previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G7M63RYFVVHJHBSIAY5S5FUDPU"&gt;In a study published last week in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012988" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;, scientists tracked a group of rhesus macaques infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus. The animals, all unvaccinated and previously unexposed to the virus, appeared to recover quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y2OPOSLBEFEHLKSSA3BW4A3EOM"&gt;But over six months, researchers found signs of chronic health issues in most of them — despite their initial symptoms being little more than sniffles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QTW5JUHLMVA5ZAC6OQN3E7VW3U"&gt;“You don’t have to have a very severe case of COVID in the first place to have potentially long-term changes,” said Dr. Charles Roberts, a lead author of the study and professor at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="462DMNIYGNB5VIUDWLL4JKXMAE"&gt;Although the animals showed only mild symptoms during the acute phase of infection, up to 90% developed signs of chronic health issues months later — including inflammation, disrupted sleep and changes in metabolic hormone levels tied to conditions like diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QPITYHHY2BCX3BTRDUC2G6JHHM"&gt;The idea isn’t new to people suffering from long COVID, the umbrella term for symptoms that persist or appear long after someone has technically recovered.

OHSU has maintained that most primates live in outdoor social groups, receive attentive veterinary care, and are part of research that meets strict federal standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SSNXF5OUU5FSNGO5G7WJU76TZE"&gt;Roberts said rhesus macaques serve as a close biological proxy for humans and a proven model for studying infectious diseases. Primates, he said, offer a controlled system that lets scientists “track things you just can’t see in people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HREZGJUZ5JEEZKRLPMYEROTXNY"&gt;The study observed the animals in two groups — some lean and healthy, others overweight — to see how underlying health influenced long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6IOGD3YPMZB4ZLSMZKYP4DG4FE"&gt;While the overweight animals experienced more dramatic changes, even the lean, healthy group didn’t fare much better.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living near the ocean is linked to longer life expectancy in both urban and rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People near large inland water bodies tend to have shorter lifespans—but only in cities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors like heat, air quality, elevation, and income help explain the difference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rural communities near lakes and rivers may still benefit from their local blue spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio —&lt;/strong&gt; A new study calls into question the general assumptions about waterfront living, showing that Americans living close to the coast tend to live longer lives, while those near inland waters like lakes and rivers actually have shorter life expectancies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s long been thought that living near waterways brings benefits for everyone. But it turns out that the location of your blue space matters far more than simply living near any water at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-researchers-analyze-66-000-communities-nationwide"&gt;Researchers Analyze 66,000+ Communities Nationwide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ohio State University analyzed data from 66,263 census tracts across the continental United States, creating one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind. They compared &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; data from 2010–2015 with proximity to both coastal waters and inland water bodies, while accounting for dozens of other factors that influence longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans living within 31 miles &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/childhood-blue-spaces-adult-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;of the coast&lt;/a&gt; showed consistently higher life expectancy rates compared to areas near large inland water bodies. The average American in the study lived 78.3 years, but that number varied based on their relationship with water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-climate-air-quality-and-income-differ-near-coasts-vs-inland-waters"&gt;How Climate, Air Quality, and Income Differ Near Coasts vs Inland Waters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The differences between coastal and inland water environments are stark. Areas near inland waters averaged 21 scorching days per year with temperatures above 95°F, while coastal areas saw just 2.2 such days. Coastal residents also breathe cleaner air, with lower levels of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; and wildfire smoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; plays a major role too. Mean household income near coastal waters reached $91,075 compared to just $67,774 near inland water bodies — a gap of more than $23,000 per year. Higher incomes often translate into better healthcare access, nutrition, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coastal geography may also provide logistical and health advantages. These areas tend to feature flatter terrain and better transportation access, while inland water regions are more mountainous and harder to navigate, affecting everything from emergency response times to daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ocean acts as a natural climate moderator, helping &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-purifier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;purify air&lt;/a&gt; and regulate temperature. Coastal areas experience less extreme weather overall, with fewer dangerously cold days and more stable seasonal patterns. Recreational access to beaches and opportunities for outdoor activity, such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/swimming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; or walking along the shore, may also offer added health benefits not always matched by inland water features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-inland-water-impacts-life-expectancy-differently-in-cities-and-rural-areas"&gt;Why Inland Water Impacts Life Expectancy Differently in Cities and Rural Areas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the research gets particularly interesting: the negative effects of inland waters primarily impact urban areas, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/rural/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rural communities&lt;/a&gt; near inland waters actually see modest life expectancy benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In cities, proximity to large inland water bodies correlates with shorter lifespans. But in rural areas, the relationship flips. Urban inland waters face greater pollution, flood risks, and air quality challenges, while rural inland waters can offer recreational and aesthetic benefits without the same environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This urban-rural split reveals that context matters enormously when evaluating how water proximity affects health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-findings-mean-for-public-health"&gt;What the Findings Mean for Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125012320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, carry serious consequences for the millions of Americans living near inland waters. The Great Lakes region, mountain lake communities, and riverside cities may need to address environmental factors that could be undermining residents’ health and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledged limitations in their work, including the inability to measure actual water quality or track how individuals personally interact with nearby water bodies. They also couldn’t include behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and exercise in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the massive scale of the study — covering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/where-you-live-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;virtually every American community&lt;/a&gt; — provides robust evidence for the patterns they identified. The consistency of results across multiple statistical approaches strengthens confidence in their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than assuming all waterfront living offers the same benefits, Americans might want to consider whether their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blue-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blue space&lt;/a&gt; comes with an ocean breeze or sits inland. The difference, the authors suggest, may be associated with meaningful differences in health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ohio State University analyzed life expectancy data from 66,263 census tracts across the continental United States from 2010–2015. They measured proximity to coastal waters using distance thresholds of 0, 20, and 50 kilometers, while proximity to inland water bodies was determined by whether census tracts contained water bodies larger than 10 or 20 square kilometers. The team used multiple regression models including linear regression, multi-level regression, and spatial regression to examine relationships while controlling for environmental factors (climate, air quality, elevation, land cover), socioeconomic variables (income, poverty rates, demographics), and geographic characteristics. They also conducted sensitivity analyses and used mutual information modeling to identify key differentiating factors between coastal and inland water environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that proximity to coastal waters within 50 kilometers was positively associated with life expectancy, while proximity to inland water bodies larger than 20 square kilometers was negatively associated with life expectancy. Census tracts near coastal waters showed consistently higher life expectancy compared to those near inland waters. Key environmental differences included: coastal areas experienced fewer hot days (2.2 vs 21.0 days above 35°C), lower maximum temperatures (34.3°C vs 37.7°C), better air quality with less PM2.5 pollution (0.52 vs 0.78 μg/m³), and higher household incomes ($91,075 vs $67,774). Urban-rural analysis revealed that inland waters negatively affected life expectancy in urban areas but positively affected it in rural areas, while coastal proximity remained beneficial in both settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study acknowledged several limitations including the use of cross-sectional ecological data that limits causal inference, the inability to measure actual water quality or recreational use patterns, and lack of data on individual behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and physical activity. The proximity-based exposure measurements may not fully capture individuals’ actual interactions with blue spaces. There were also potential temporal mismatches between exposure timing and life expectancy estimates, and the possibility of residual confounding from unmeasured healthcare access and quality factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children born by planned cesarean section are 21% more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a childhood cancer, than those born vaginally, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted in Sweden, is consistent with previous studies that also found a link between pediatric ALL risk and C-sections. More recent research, including this latest study, has specifically connected the majority of that risk to planned C-sections. In this study, planned C-sections were defined as those initiated prior to labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But crucially, the risk of ALL, and childhood cancer in general, remains low across the board, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/joseph-leo-wiemels/" target="_blank" data-url="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/joseph-leo-wiemels/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joseph Wiemels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the work. In the U.S., &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/childleuk.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/childleuk.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 4.8 in 100,000 children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with leukemia per year. So while "the relative risk [for ALL] is significantly higher" for babies born by planned cesarean, Wiemels cautioned that that the risk is "still relatively low" overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cesarean section "is a vital and often life-saving component of modern obstetric care," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ki.se/en/people/christina-evmorfia-kampitsi" target="_blank" data-url="https://ki.se/en/people/christina-evmorfia-kampitsi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Christina Evmorfia-Kampitsi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolina Institutet, told Live Science in an email. Some people give birth by planned C-section due to maternal conditions, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000898.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000898.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or to protect the baby's health because they aren't getting enough oxygen, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings should not be a cause for concern when the procedure is medically indicated," Evmorfia-Kampitsi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/babies-brain-activity-changes-dramatically-before-and-after-birth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/babies-brain-activity-changes-dramatically-before-and-after-birth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babies' brain activity changes dramatically before and after birth, groundbreaking study finds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="confirming-a-known-link-3"&gt;Confirming a known link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's unique about the study, published July 4 in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.70027" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.70027" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Journal of Cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is that researchers controlled for a range of characteristics in mothers and newborns and still found a higher risk of ALL in children born by planned cesarean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to the richness of Swedish register data, we were able to adjust for a wide range of maternal, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pregnancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and neonatal [newborn] factors," Evmorfia-Kampitsi said. "This helps strengthen the evidence that the association is not merely due to underlying conditions that might have led to the CS [C-section] in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlling for these other factors is important, Wiemels said, in part because maternal ages above 35 are also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6384148/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6384148/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;associated with a higher risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of children developing ALL. There's also a link between &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022347698701003" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022347698701003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birth defects and ALL risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as environmental factors like radiation. But because ALL occurs at such young ages, researchers have been exploring factors before and just after birth that may lead to its development, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/staff/daee.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/staff/daee.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Danielle Daee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, program director of the genomic epidemiology branch at the National Cancer Institute who wasn't involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at the mode of delivery — vaginal, planned cesarean or unplanned cesarean — in more than 2.4 million births that took place in Sweden over 20 years. Data on newborns' weights, birth defects, and whether their mothers were overweight or had obesity, diabetes or preeclampsia were also examined. Additionally, they looked at the incidence of ALL among these children over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also grouped the kids based on the decade in which they were born, to account for changes in obstetric practice, the rate of C-sections, changes in how childhood cancers are diagnosed, and other factors that might vary over time, Evmorfia-Kampitsi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 375,000 of the children, about 15%, were born by C-section, including about 213,000 planned, which were initiated prior to labor starting. About 1,200 of the 2.4 million children, or 0.05%, developed ALL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of ALL was higher among the babies born by any type of C-section than among those born vaginally. There was a slight increase in risk tied to unplanned C-sections, which began post-labor, but the risk was highest among those born by planned cesarean, initiated before labor began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned C-sections could be further divided into "planned" and "acute," with the latter meaning there was some sort of immediate medical need, like fetal distress. These acute cases didn't seem tied to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; increase in cancer risk — but because there were only a handful of such cases, it's difficult to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results should be interpreted with caution," Evmorfia-Kampitsi said. "Our primary finding remains the increased risk associated with planned pre-labor CS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-reveal-surprising-factor-that-may-prolong-pregnancy" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-reveal-surprising-factor-that-may-prolong-pregnancy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists reveal surprising factor that may prolong pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cause-for-concern-3"&gt;Cause for concern?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood ALL is most often diagnosed in children under 5 years old, and the study findings were only statistically significant for the children in this age group. In other words, the connection between planned C-sections and ALL seems clearest in that age range, Evmorfia-Kampitsi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study may "tell us something about leukemia risk, and the mechanisms behind that risk," Wiemels suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that front, it's known that there are genetic mutations that can develop before birth and cause children to be born with pre-leukemia cells. However, more children are born with these cells than actually develop full-blown cancer, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/erin-marcotte" target="_blank" data-url="https://med.umn.edu/bio/erin-marcotte" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Erin Marcotte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Division of Pediatric Epidemiology &amp;amp; Clinical Research at the University of Minnesota, who wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's likely that most children are able to cull those cells," Marcotte told Live Science in an email. But how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two leading theories as to how this works, and how those mechanisms may be compromised by planned C-sections. The first suggests that babies born via C-section miss out on exposure to microbes in the vaginal canal, which may promote a more "permissive" environment for leukemia to develop, Wiemels said. Babies born via C-sections that begin before labor are exposed to fewer microbes than those whose C-section start after labor because, at that point, the water has broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second hypothesis is that babies born by planned C-section miss out on short-term exposure to stress hormones that they would typically encounter during labor. It's thought that these hormones may help eliminate pre-leukemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the idea is the fact that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/child-all-treatment-pdq" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/child-all-treatment-pdq" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;corticosteroids are a mainstay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of childhood leukemia treatments, and are similar to body-made cortisol. Additionally, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/k-schmiegelow" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/k-schmiegelow" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kjeld Schmiegelow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor at the University of Copenhagen, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_5660407662149926785&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fleu2008212&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Fplanned-c-sections-linked-to-increased-risk-of-childhood-leukemia-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/leu2008212" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fleu2008212&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Fplanned-c-sections-linked-to-increased-risk-of-childhood-leukemia-study-finds" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has hypothesized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the stress that stems from infections in early childhood can help eliminate pre-leukemic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the root cause of the link, the absolute risk of ALL remains low even in the context of C-sections. But it's potentially something for doctors to consider, Evmorfia-Kampitsi said. "When a CS is being considered without a clear medical indication, it's important to be aware of potential long-term outcomes," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, more research on the relationship between ALL and planned cesarean is needed, as countries with higher rates of cesarean deliveries don't always have higher rates of ALL. Since the study was done in Sweden, "it is plausible, but not confirmed, that other populations, with different demographic features and environmental exposures, may have a similar result," said Daee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS-VKE4XvquPoKgaIcjmTcOPHUWXL70w2Yk" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Crd5zr5bSuKeVw9YviMgrS-VKE4XvquPoKgaIcjmTcOPHUWXL70w2Yk slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It gives scientists a better chance to study it in depth and gives patients and families more time to plan and get support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, US researchers have uncovered four telltale medical sequences that appear to predict the onset of the progressive neurological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the large new study, scientists analyzed health records from 24,473 people diagnosed with Alzheimer's, searching for patterns that typically led up to their diagnosis – and crucially, how different factors combined in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that multi-step trajectories can indicate greater risk factors for Alzheimer's disease than single conditions," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/new-study-maps-four-key-pathways-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mingzhou Fu, a bioinformatician at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding these pathways could fundamentally change how we approach early detection and prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-2-existing-drugs-can-reverse-alzheimers-brain-damage-in-mice?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Find 2 Existing Drugs Can Reverse Alzheimer's Brain Damage in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four "trajectory clusters" were identified by the team, which are essentially different routes to Alzheimer's, like step-by-step directions towards a destination on a map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of an independent dataset&lt;span&gt; from across the US &lt;/span&gt;found people who follow one of these trajectories tend to have a significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-all-do-to-hold-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;higher risk of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four clusters were mental health (psychiatric conditions), encephalopathy (brain dysfunctions that gradually get worse), mild cognitive impairment (declining mental dexterity), and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-cut-heart-disease-risk-heres-how-many-flights-of-stairs-to-climb-daily"&gt;vascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (heart and blood conditions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168765" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168765" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's clusters" class="wp-image-168765 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic-547x415.jpg 547w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AlzheimersGraphic-600x455.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168765" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers identified four clusters of pathways to Alzheimer's. (Fu et al., &lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an algorithmic approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping"&gt;dynamic time warping&lt;/a&gt;  to standardize the duration and sequence of health issues across these thousands of database records, and find patterns that matched up between patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mental health cluster, for example, anxiety often came first, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, which often eventually led to Alzheimer's. In the vascular cluster, conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and joint disorders were common starting points on the road to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the four clusters, thousands of different individual trajectories were identified, varying in terms of their progression speeds and associated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt;Alzheimer's risk level&lt;/a&gt;. It shows just how complex the road to Alzheimer's can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By unveiling distinct and interconnected routes to Alzheimer's disease, this approach offers insights that may improve risk assessment, timely diagnosis, and targeted interventions," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105831"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their findings, the team ran their model on a separate set of health records from 8,512 people. The pathways identified by the study were far more likely to be present in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;those with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;adding weight to the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, understanding more about how Alzheimer's progresses in the body could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;help us stop it&lt;/a&gt;: there may be blocks that can be put in place along the way that prevent the disease from fully developing, or at least reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, there's plenty more work to do here. The researchers want to study broader groups of people with and without Alzheimer's to further validate their findings, and expand the work to more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;types of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these four clusters don't imply direct cause and effect or guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer's, they're likely to be important in future assessments of patients – and in figuring out how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;to stop this devastating disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recognizing these sequential patterns rather than focusing on diagnoses in isolation may help clinicians improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/new-study-maps-four-key-pathways-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Timothy Chang, from UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105831"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                A big new study finds that diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes can significantly enhance the health of aging brains.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have unveiled the strongest evidence yet that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can improve thinking and memory in older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2837046" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s found that those who spent two years on the intensive regimen not only improved their mental abilities, but appeared to reduce the usual declines associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These people are obtaining cognitive function scores that are similar to people [like them who are] one to two years younger than they are," says &lt;a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu/faculty/b/laura-d-baker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Laura Baker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study's principal investigators and a professor of gerontology and geriatrics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is really showing that we can change people's trajectories over time," says &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/research/about-banner-research/research-leadership/jessica-langbaum" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Langbaum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Results of what's known as the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37776210/" target="_blank"&gt;POINTER&lt;/a&gt; study were reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Toronto. They were published simultaneously in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results are consistent with earlier findings from a &lt;a href="https://fbhi.se/the-finger-study/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;smaller Finnish study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which involved a less diverse population. They are also consistent with decades of research suggesting that single interventions, like exercise, could reduce brain and cognitive changes associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A study of people at risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The POINTER study was limited to people from ages 60 to 79 who had normal memory and thinking but were at elevated risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You had to be sedentary, not a regular exerciser, and you had to be consuming a sub-optimal diet," Baker says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half the participants were asked to come up with their own plan to eat better and exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other half entered an intensive, highly structured program that included aerobic exercise four times a week, adherence to a heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, online cognitive training, mandatory social activities, and monitoring levels of blood pressure and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both groups improved on tests of memory and cognition, but the intensive group did markedly better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though difficult, the intensive regimen was "life changing" for many participants, Baker says. Most were able to make substantial and lasting changes, thanks to coaching, supervision, and lots of encouragement, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is no way to form a new habit or change behavior without intentional work on a regular basis," Baker says. "It's impossible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Next comes the hard part&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Association spent nearly $50 million conducting the POINTER study. The National Institutes of Health spent an even greater amount to have many of the participants undergo brain scans, blood tests, and sleep studies that, once published, will provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The results are limited to changes in normal brain aging, not Alzheimer's disease. But scientists think lifestyle changes that improve cognition and reduce "brain age" are likely to delay dementia, including Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the Alzheimer's Association is planning to invest another $40 million over four years to implement what they've learned from POINTER.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The translation from the POINTER prescription to how we then deliver that into the community is absolutely the next step," Snyder says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To do that, the group will be asking a range of questions, Snyder says:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's somebody going to respond to? Is it going to be something from their health care provider. Is it some sort of app, a motivation using technology, is it something in their technology that they go do?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These kinds of efforts to change behavior nationwide should be bolstered by Americans' growing desire for guidance on how to improve their brain health, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At the Alzheimer's Association it's one of the top questions we get," she says. People often say things like, 'My mother had dementia, my father had memory problems, what can I do?' And that's a motivating question for someone."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One important step will be buy-in from the nation's health care providers, Langbaum says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Doctors should be treating lifestyle interventions as they would a drug," she says. That would mean prescribing regimens like the one in POINTER, and getting insurance companies to cover those prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another boost to implementation could come from study results still in the works. These include analyses of brain scans and blood tests indicating whether a person's cognitive improvement was accompanied by measurable changes in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those results are expected to be published later this year. In the meantime, Langbaum says, even people who are living a healthy lifestyle might want to up their game.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you already do the Sunday crossword puzzle, and it's not challenging, pick up something new, find that exercise regimen that you'll adhere to," she says, "and if you can do it around people, that's even better."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Langbaum notes that socializing is one of the best ways to keep your brain young.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So it’s natural to wonder if there are foods to eat for migraines that might help ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/brian-l-gerhardstein/2094680" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of headache medicine at JFK University Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://freshcommunications.com/team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian at FRESH Communications; and &lt;a href="https://www.sachardental.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist based in New York City&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A migraine is a neurological condition that causes severe headaches and pain, according to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fmigraine-headache%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20360201&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65489066%2Fbest-foods-to-eat-for-migraines%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. And its causes are hard to pin down—there are so many factors at play, and diet is just one of them. “The concept of food triggers in the development of migraine headaches is complex,” says &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/brian-l-gerhardstein/2094680" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brian Gerhardstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of headache medicine at JFK University Medical Center. And because most migraine-havers experience very different frequencies and pain points, there is no specific cure-all diet that will promise results. For example, some people find that caffeine helps their headaches, and others find the ingredient is a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is “growing evidence” that certain foods may help relieve migraines or reduce their frequency, says &lt;a href="https://freshcommunications.com/team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kayla Farrell, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt; at FRESH Communications. “While identifying and avoiding trigger foods is important, incorporating nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory foods into the diet can also support migraine management,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods and drinks for migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some foods experts say may help you find relief or lessen the frequency of migraines. Again, more research is needed on the connection between what you eat and migraines, but these bites and sips may be promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, sardines, and oysters are high in omega-3 fatty acids, “which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties,” says Farrell, and therefore &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327818300723" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may offer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may offer&lt;/a&gt; migraine relief. In &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, after 16 weeks of treatment with diets higher in omega-3 fatty acids, the frequency and severity of headaches in people with regular migraines were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flax seeds, edamame, walnuts, and avocado&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t meat eaters, these foods are also high in omega-3 fatty acids and may offer the above benefits while remaining plant-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sweet potato, eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, migraines are triggered by temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), explains &lt;a href="https://www.sachardental.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sandip Sachar, D.D.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist based in New York City, which manifests as tight muscles around the jaw, head, and neck, often due to teeth clenching or grinding. Symptoms can be exacerbated by a diet of hard, chewy foods. So, Sachar recommends prioritizing soft, nutritious eats like mashed sweet potatoes and scrambled eggs that are easy to chew and won’t trigger pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beans, berries, and apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9846638/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 12,710 people, researchers found that an increase of 10 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a33382312/fiber-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day in their diets decreased severe headache or migraine prevalence by 11%. Most fruits and vegetables contain some amount of fiber, but legumes, berries, and apples, are on the top of that list. The study authors explained that the gut-brain axis’s impact on migraines has not been explored much, but research suggests that more “intestinal permeability may lead to the arrival of pro-inflammatory substances,” in an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7164539/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:area of the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;area of the brain&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in pain receptors and headaches. Therefore, boosting fiber may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brown rice, bananas, and dark leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503279/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published in 2021 found that people who experienced migraines weren’t getting enough magnesium, “a mineral that plays a role in muscle and nerve function,” explains Farrell. The study authors noted that magnesium’s association with serotonin (a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemical;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; that carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and body) may aid in migraine treatment. Other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7489225/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found the nutrient to offer some relief in women with migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many foods on this list &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60749717/foods-high-in-magnesium/#foods-high-in-magnesium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contain magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;contain magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, and some other honorable mentions are brown rice, bananas, and dark leafy greens. In fact, one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8689122/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; discovered improvement of migraines when participants followed a whole food, plant-based diet with emphasis on dark, leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Water, cucumber, and watermelon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to maintain adequate hydration throughout the course of the day as well,” says Dr. Gerhardstein. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446809/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; on 256 adult women who were 45 and younger found that drinking more water each day decreased both the severity and frequency of their migraines. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8280611/#Sec8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dehydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/a&gt; related to migraines can be overlooked as a trigger and can make headaches worse,” adds Farrell. If you struggle to drink enough water, you can eat hydrating fruits and vegetables like cucumber and watermelon to help support fluid balance and retention, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to avoid if you get migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avoiding or limiting certain foods may be important for a subset of people with migraines, but there is inconsistent scientific evidence that certain foods are migraine triggers,” says Dr. Gerhardstein. With that said, “the most commonly cited triggering foods include alcohol and chocolate,” he adds. “Other possible triggers include cheese, yogurt, meats containing sulfites (like salami, ham, sausage, and bacon), soy products, certain vegetables (like tomatoes and onions), as well as foods containing aspartame sweetener, MSG, or caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s important to note that there is a lack of consistency among research on all of these potential triggers. “So, this means that there is no particular food that should be avoided for all migraine sufferers,” says Dr. Gerhardstein. “In fact, avoiding certain foods for fear of migraine attacks may actually cause more health concerns, stress, or social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Caffeine and migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gerhardstein mentioned, caffeine is often cited as a migraine trigger ingredient by his patients. However, it’s worth mentioning that the stimulant is an active ingredient in multiple over-the-counter headache medications, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Excedrin-Strength-Caplets-Headache-Relief/dp/B012SA8IOO?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65489066%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Excedrin;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Excedrin&lt;/a&gt;. Also, some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468766/#sec4-nutrients-12-02259" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found caffeine to effectively relieve acute headache pain, but notes that further investigation into the link between the two is warranted to fully understand caffeine’s potential impact. Therefore, consult your physician if you believe caffeine may help or hinder your migraine symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Migraine diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generally accepted migraine diet would simply be a healthy, balanced diet that prioritizes whole, fresh foods, says Dr. Gerhardstein. “More studies are needed to discern if there is indeed a scientific basis for specific food triggers in migraines,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:29:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9lSEFDbmdBRDZnV3c1alRSNlNHLS0wSUV2dkVVYVl5V2JkSV9COUMzQXdIWFlyNThtTnVjcVR4Wi1IRmFUa1JFR0M1ZmlsdG5SNW9wNmU5dEhCRUJzNEwtNzhHR0lGcU9FYjZ1QmdYa0s</guid></item><item><title>肌酸可能是看到严重肌肉增长的秘诀—但不要犯这个错误-纽约邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOejhVaGFpZFJteE0zdHBoQjM4SWdjTGp0c1Z1M2YtdHJvZ2R4TVk3UlNDSVE1bFFRZTQ4aXVsWHdoUGNoYzhoV1EzV0RUaUVpZzNKQVhfMlVVZm92enFjb0pOWDBfY1RULWNZQzRJNzM3MEJXVnZYZzlzUjV5TThuYkg3WlpBclFlNG92Z05XRlVJbkhaWE9ibnlJNldIeDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTokers describe it as “natural fuel,” and biochemists tout its far-reaching benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/c/protein-fitness/performance-supplements/creatine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; craze is real. The organic compound, which is naturally found in the body’s muscles, as well as seafood, meat, and poultry, has been trusted by professional athletes for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s surging in popularity online and has become one of the most studied supplements in sports nutrition. But, choosing the right form — and brand — is very important, as some people could be more sensitive to side effects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/c/protein-fitness/performance-supplements/creatine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The Vitamin Shoppe&lt;/a&gt;, creatine sales have exploded by over 320% in the past five years. The company’s nutritionist, Brian Tanzer, explained that creatine works by helping muscles produce more energy during short, intense activities like sprinting, lifting weights, or doing burpees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10449017" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that men who added creatine to their diets made greater strength and muscle mass gains after 12 weeks of strength-training than those who took a placebo. Emerging research has also revealed that creatine could support &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;, healthy aging, and even blood sugar level regulation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, before starting creatine, there are some things users should be aware of. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creatine can draw water into the intestines, which may lead to gut discomfort for some users. On social media, some &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@realityofnaj/video/7517096138793618719" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;viral posts&lt;/a&gt; reveal alarming before-and-after videos highlighting bloating as a side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tanzer shared that there is another option for those with sensitive stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have digestive issues with monohydrate, you’d want to try creatine hydrochloride, which is more soluble,” he recommended, also adding that drinking plenty of water also helps the body metabolize the creatine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re goal is to complete a marathon or triathlon, creatine may not be the best supplement for you. Tanzer explained that it’s a great compound for bursts of power, but does less for long-term endurance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vitamin Shoppe offers a selection of &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/c/protein-fitness/performance-supplements/creatine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;creatine products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/p/creatine-monohydrate-unflavored-60-powder/vs-0397" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;powders&lt;/a&gt;, soft-chew &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/ZFOXOZJL/p/creatine-gummies-strawberry-90-chews/vs-0442" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;bites&lt;/a&gt;, and time-release &lt;a href="https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/creatine-beadlet-n-a-120-capsules/vs-0401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;beadlets&lt;/a&gt; that support a variety of health needs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As always, be sure to check with a physician before adding new supplements to your health regimen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitive stomach? No worries. BodyTech is Vitamin Shoppe’s #1 selling creatine brand, and the 100% Pure Creatine Monohydrate is micronized for enhanced absorption and reduced GI discomfort. It’s also completely free of the junk — artificial sweeteners, dyes, fillers, and additives. Mix it into a glass of water, and get your daily dose of 5 grams of creatine in every scoop. Reviewers say they barely notice the taste, but have noticed some big changes during sweat sessions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions: &lt;/strong&gt;Mix one (1) scoop with 8-12 oz. of water and consume immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The flagship health journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has grown quiet this year, and a report from &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/116670"&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/a&gt; indicates that a variety of actions by the Trump administration may be to blame for hamstringing the critical resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most strikingly, sources told MedPage that the journal's scientific articles must now obtain clearance for publication from health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has no health, science, or medical background. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services disputed this claim, calling it "false."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, there's no denying that the journal appears to have been muffled in some ways since the new administration took office. Publications have slowed and press are no longer getting early access to studies under the standard embargo system. And, for the first time in its more than 60-year history, the journal—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html"&gt;the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)&lt;/a&gt;—was not published on schedule amid a blanket federal communication freeze in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MedPage crunched the numbers, looking at published study totals for May, June, and July in past years compared to this one. The outlet included five previous years: 2022 to 2024 as well as 2018 to 2019, leaving out the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic when public health communications could have spiked. In 2025, there were only 35 total publications in the three-month window, but in the past years, the average was 76, with a range of 55 to 89.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/19753/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/quick-easy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Quick &amp;amp; Easy Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 313 to 390 calories, while the lunches span 377 to 390 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are ways to help make your cells more responsive to insulin, such as weight loss, exercise and by eating a balanced diet that is higher in fiber and protein and less added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_157-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who follow the Mediterranean diet are less likely to develop insulin resistance and its associated conditions, like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because the Mediterranean diet is so broad, there is not one single nutrient or food that we can point to as the reason for its associated health benefits. Rather, it's likely that the diet's high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; content—from its inclusion of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes—plays a role. Plus, the diet incorporates foods linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, like nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables, fish, unsaturated-fat-rich plant oils, herbs, spices, nuts and seeds. Though it doesn't completely restrict anything, the Mediterranean diet doesn't include a lot of added sugars or processed and refined grains, which are linked to increased blood sugar levels. And, the diet focuses on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025502/cooking-and-eating-together-impact-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy habits around food&lt;/a&gt;, such as cooking more meals at home, sharing meals with others and finding overall enjoyment in our food again.

Using objective sleep data from actigraphy devices worn by over 88,000 people for nearly seven years, the study found that erratic bedtimes and poor circadian stability were among the most damaging traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with irregular sleep schedules had significantly higher risks for serious conditions, including liver cirrhosis and gangrene. The findings challenge previous assumptions about long sleep being harmful and spotlight sleep regularity—not just duration—as a critical factor in long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep regularity was linked to 172 diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Irregular bedtime raised liver cirrhosis risk 2.57x; low rhythm stability raised gangrene risk 2.61x.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth Debunked:&lt;/strong&gt; Most “long sleepers” actually had poor sleep efficiency—not longer sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A groundbreaking international study, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed objective sleep data from 88,461 adults in the UK Biobank and found significant associations between sleep traits and 172 diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by teams from Peking University and Army Medical University, highlights sleep regularity—such as bedtime consistency and circadian rhythm stability—as an underrecognized but critical factor in disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111979"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sleep-health-disease-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people sleeping.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using actigraphy data over an average of 6.8 years, researchers identified that 92 diseases had over 20% of their risk attributable to poor sleep behavior. Notably, irregular bedtime (after 00:30) was linked to a 2.57-fold higher risk of liver cirrhosis, while low interdaily stability increased the risk of gangrene by 2.61 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study challenges previous claims that “long sleep” (≥9 hours) is harmful. While subjective reports have linked long sleep to stroke and heart disease, objective data revealed this association in only one disease. Misclassification may be to blame: 21.67% of “long sleepers” actually slept less than 6 hours, suggesting that time spent in bed is often confused with actual sleep time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings underscore the overlooked importance of sleep regularity,” said Prof. Shengfeng Wang, senior author of the study. “It’s time we broaden our definition of good sleep beyond just duration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team confirmed several associations in U.S. populations and identified inflammatory pathways as a possible biological link. Future research will explore causality and assess the impact of sleep interventions on chronic disease outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#09646860567e68676e49667c7d65666662276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mai Wang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spj.science.org/journal/hds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mai Wang – Health Data Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.34133/hds.0161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Phenome-wide Analysis of Diseases in Relation to Objectively Measured Sleep Traits and Comparison with Subjective Sleep Traits in 88,461 Adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Yimeng Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Health Data Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenome-wide Analysis of Diseases in Relation to Objectively Measured Sleep Traits and Comparison with Subjective Sleep Traits in 88,461 Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep traits have been suggested to correlate with various diseases, but most evidence is based on subjective sleep measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated the associations of accelerometer-derived objective sleep traits with diseases throughout physiological systems to ascertain whether the disease spectrum related to objective sleep traits differs from that related to subjective sleep traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; In 88,461 UK Biobank (UKB) adults wearing accelerometers, multiple dimensions of sleep were objectively derived: (a) nocturnal sleep duration and onset timing, (b) sleep rhythm (relative amplitude and interdaily stability), and (c) sleep fragmentation (sleep efficiency and waking numbers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision–decoded diseases during follow-up were estimated using the Cox model, and the results were compared with those of a published literature search of subjectively measured sleep traits and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were used to validate the newly identified associations unreported by previous studies. For the meta-analysis-reported associations (with subjective sleep traits) that were negative (with objective sleep traits) in our study, reanalysis was done in UKB with subjective sleep traits, stratified by objective measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; During the average 6.8-year follow-up, 172 diseases were associated with sleep traits. Among them, 42 showed at least doubled disease risk, including age-related physical debility (lowest versus highest quartile of relative amplitude, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25, 5.02), gangrene (lowest versus highest quartile of interdaily stability, HR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.41, 4.83), and fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver (sleep onset timing ≥0030 versus 2300 to 2330, HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.42, 4.67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 92 diseases had &amp;gt;20% burden attributable to sleep, such as Parkinson’s disease (37.05%, 95% CI: 21.02%, 49.83%), type 2 diabetes (36.12%, 95% CI: 29.00%, 42.52%), and acute kidney failure (21.85%, 95% CI: 13.47%, 29.42%). Notably, 83 (48.3%) disease associations were sleep rhythm specific, distinct from existing subjective-measure literature that focused on sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reanalysis in UKB showed a contamination of objectively short sleepers in self-report long sleepers, which induced false-positive associations in subjective meta-analyses, including for ischemic heart disease and depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly identified associations of sleep rhythm with 4 diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes were successfully replicated in NHANES. A mediation analysis showed that inflammatory factors including leukocytes, eosinophils, and C-reactive protein contributed significantly to all these newly identified sleep–disease associations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Objective sleep traits showed a disease spectrum similar to but not identical to that of subjective sleep traits. Objective measurement can be a useful complement to sleep–disease studies as it may help overcome false-positive associations caused by misclassification bias of some subjective measurement such as sleep duration. Comprehensive control of multiple sleep traits may be important for health as substantial disease burden was attributed to different sleep traits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 17:06:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5PUF9KWThXQ0V4R1NRbTJvVTRMUWZNSGFKR3huVkhIOXFSZjBOY3pfcExWZGtBWGR5SmFJTEI1VkIxS3BpX1BHZ2VvcU1jYnhWdFlPMjV0N3BYYTBqTXpBRV9GcUVZT0N4</guid></item><item><title>科学家可能已经在我们的直觉中找到了人类的第六感- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE1tRkRqeXdnMkdDNnN4RGl3NnNLMFlUM0c2Qi1YeXQ2bllCc0JtZUZzU2ItSnRweFM0YlZHejJ2dzdtaGQ1N3VRdk5XSnhLNjlGZ2xxS2xvSEU0MVBtX1c3MHd5eXpoakZhM3Q1RE8xOUdHSW90YVUwcXJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Scientists May Have Found Humanity’s Sixth Sense&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Yuichiro Chino - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study says that the organisms in our gut have more direct influence on our actions that we previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists analyzed an ancient protein called flagellin, released from the tail of bacteria (known as the flagella), and found that the gut’s neuropods could sense this protein, triggering an appetite-suppressing response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team hopes that a greater understanding of what impacts the microbiome could help experts develop treatments for obesity and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science textbooks typically describe humans as having five senses—&lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64655992/regenerate-retina-sight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seeing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seeing&lt;/a&gt;, smelling, hearing, seeing, and touching. While it’s true these are the most outward and &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; senses, they’re far from the only ones. For one, there’s proprioception, which describes the body’s ability to sense its position and movement in space—that may not seem like a big deal, but if you live without it, poor balance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/proprioception#symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is only the beginning of your problems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is only the beginning of your problems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, a new study led by scientists at Duke University suggests that there’s yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; sense lurking in our gut. This is the home of the microbiome—a collection of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea that impact our &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a64673758/snake-man-antivenom/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, our digestion, and even our mental health. And it’s within this microbiome that bacterial flagella (the tail-like structure bacteria use to swim) release an ancient protein known as “flagellin.” This new study, published yesterday in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09301-7%23Sec9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65503221%2Fneurobiotic-sense%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:journal Nature;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes the flagellin as the method through which neuropods, essentially neurons in your gut, regulate appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the scientists, neuropods contain a receptor known as “toll-like receptor 5,” or TLR5, which then sends impulses to the brain via the vagus nerve—the gut-brain information highway that is also the longest nerve of the body’s autonomic nervous system. This shows how &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a62544952/two-billion-year-old-microbes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:microbes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; living in our gut can communicate with the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were curious whether the body could sense microbial patterns in real time and not just as an immune or inflammatory response,” Diego Bohórquez, the senior author of the study from Duke University, said in a press statement, “but as a neural response that guides behavior in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the idea, scientists fasted mice overnight, and when supplied with a dose of flagellin to the colon, the mice ate less than expected. When the same experiment was conducted with mice that lacked the TLR5 receptor, the mice ate their fill and quickly gained weight. This suggests that this microbe-to-brain communication pathway plays a role in giving &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65255851/synthetic-genome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;—and other mammals—the “I’m full” sense. This is what the researchers call our “neurobiotic sense,” and it very well could be our sixth sense. Or, maybe seventh? Or eighth? We’ve lost count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the microbiome is an immensely chaotic environment, containing some 100 trillion microbial &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65398598/beating-cell-death-with-anti-necrotics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; that can all be influenced by diet, lifestyle, and environment. The next step for the scientists is to figure out what diets change the microbiome and in what ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, I think this work will be especially helpful for the broader scientific community to explain how our behavior is influenced by microbes,” Bohórquez said in a press statement. “That could be a key piece of the puzzle in conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a23132898/states-with-highest-obesity-rates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; or psychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 16:52:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1tRkRqeXdnMkdDNnN4RGl3NnNLMFlUM0c2Qi1YeXQ2bllCc0JtZUZzU2ItSnRweFM0YlZHejJ2dzdtaGQ1N3VRdk5XSnhLNjlGZ2xxS2xvSEU0MVBtX1c3MHd5eXpoakZhM3Q1RE8xOUdHSW90YVUwcXJB</guid></item><item><title>化学盾牌阻止触发疾病的DNA损伤- “范式转变” -好消息网络</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNUzlieEhtNjRhNy05a3FzVHJITmxwUVl6MnBlMkhLQVJROGRkQ1o3ckM5dk9QYlZrcUdoZk1jbDNjN05jRnJoY0RJMXE0VFFNZzFpQUU0RE1fOFZoT3AtYVU2V0ZJZlY0bXE1clNJQk50RDl1cHZpSG9uVkM3NkNpVE1SSHFjQnhUWVZoa0I0aEJRVG1USS1OWVJ5X3F5cWRkTDVpc3BteWt0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new chemical probe protects healthy cells from DNA damage, preserving them from one of the 8 hallmarks of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this potentially paradigmatic development begins where so much of human health begins: the mitochondria. These organelles are disrespectfully monikered as “the powerhouses” of the cell, but they do so much more than just provide cellular energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so important, it even has its own DNA. &lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is separate from the DNA housed in a cell’s nucleus. While nuclear DNA contains the vast majority of the genetic code, mitochondria carry their own smaller genomes that are essential for cellular functions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;MtDNA exists in multiple copies per cell, but when damage occurs these copies are often degraded rather than repaired. If left unchecked, this degradation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt; can set off a cascade of failures linked to heart conditions, neurodegeneration, and chronic inflammation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.7mi9uuAP0Ed-2BNfyXj0eZnjCEMShBsVWOB27mTWd4mujq4SvRsb5U7DEDToT0lDA-2Ft8HCp-2FQz1zKJyr7j-2FATO1EanXopA89jFDzH4Z1ifO9A-3DHO0Y_B6BZnHqZQWKc-2Fye3pBcBpLJBYcfy4QRdfZeMLXkRfBCkBmm8V7nZk3Ec16U2rz0cLpgD-2BwH1YghVqo8AsQqk2-2FTzJ9MwdusVdgAE-2F8h-2FKLBbUbILatV36mu631fVvalv-2BnKqouC1QQzAcUhUrqAMX30aiHfwkHFukkfNFfNMrx7mmSD-2FwtLvmpewMmRPjxl4gDbjoIXAU7X8L0wob00hUoMfXBaBCfFltGGRY8g36JvaO1nnfx5YrYzirXUgssVi8TAFVhRgD2ssNYXd-2F7fo-2BImSHYhgrtN-2Bm3ZsxHJv9QyjincFA-2B5jRlgH6ZyHZIUS4-2BBECq9Pj-2FqLiwVgnOnH8m7rEjE4uHmHModUKVqenWZElVBu7phBwuOcR-2Fw1CXFd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in the German Chemical Society journal &lt;em&gt;Angewandte Chemie&lt;/em&gt; International Edition, researchers at UC Riverside developed a chemical probe that binds to damaged sites in mitochondrial DNA and blocks the enzymatic processes that lead to its degradation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“There are already pathways in cells that attempt repair,” &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/07/21/chemical-shield-stops-stressed-dna-triggering-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Linlin Zhao, UCR associate professor of chemistry, who led the project. “But degradation happens more frequently than repair due to the redundancy of mtDNA molecules in mitochondria. Our strategy is to stop the loss before it becomes a problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;The new molecule includes two key components: one that recognizes and attaches to damaged DNA, and another that ensures it is delivered specifically to mitochondria, leaving nuclear DNA unaffected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;In lab tests as well as studies using living cells, the probe significantly reduced mtDNA loss after lab-induced damage mimicking exposure to toxic chemicals such as nitrosamines, which are common environmental pollutants found in processed foods, water, and cigarette smoke. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;In cells treated with the probe molecule, mtDNA levels remained higher, which could be critical for maintaining energy production in vulnerable tissues such as the heart and brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA loss is increasingly linked to a range of diseases, from multi-organ mitochondrial depletion syndromes to chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. When mtDNA fragments escape from mitochondria into the rest of the cell, they can act as distress signals that activate immune responses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“If we can retain the DNA inside the mitochondria, we might be able to prevent those downstream signals that cause inflammation,” Zhao said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE AGING SOLUTIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Man’s Biological Clock Set Back 10 Years After 93 Days Living Under the Ocean in a Research Station" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mans-biological-clock-set-back-10-years-after-93-days-living-under-the-ocean-in-a-research-station/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Man’s Biological Clock Set Back 10 Years After 93 Days Living Under the Ocean in a Research Station&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that the protected DNA remained functional, despite being chemically tagged. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“We thought adding a bulky chemical might prevent the DNA from working properly,” Zhao said. “But to our surprise, it was still able to support transcription, the process cells use to turn DNA into RNA, and then into proteins. That opens the door for therapeutic applications.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;The project builds on more than two years of research into the cellular mechanisms that govern mtDNA processing. While additional studies are needed to explore clinical potential, the new molecule represents a paradigm shift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE AGING SOLUTION: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Psychedelic Mushrooms Reduced Human Cellular Aging by 57%, Increased Lifespan in Mice 30%" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/psychedelic-mushrooms-reduced-human-cellular-aging-by-57-increased-lifespan-in-mice-30/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Psychedelic Mushrooms Reduced Human Cellular Aging by 57%, Increased Lifespan in Mice 30%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DNA damage makes up two of the 8 hallmarks of aging first outlined in a landmark paper in 2013, which also includes mitochondrial dysfunction as an antagonistic hallmark, i.e. a result of DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="v1p1"&gt;&lt;span class="v1s1"&gt;“This is a chemical approach to prevention, not just repair,” Zhao said. “It’s a new way of thinking about how to defend the genome under stress.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

experiments to see how they responded to faces they were shown.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Lombardini22 Neuroscience Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Participants were then split into groups and shown the same three faces multiple times, either with a neutral expression or signs of viral infections such as skin rashes. In some experiments, an additional subset of participants were shown the faces displaying an expression of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one experiment, participants were asked to press a button as fast as possible after receiving a mild touch to their face while an avatar was shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team found that when the avatars showed signs of sickness, participants pressed the button when the faces appeared further away than for faces showing a neutral or fearful expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Results from EEG tests to investigate the electrical activity of the brain tallied with these findings. As expected, as avatars loomed closer, the brain system that represents the space closely surrounding our body became activated. However, this activation differed when the avatars showed signs of infection compared with neutral expressions, even when they appeared far away. These differences, the team add, were localised in areas of the brain involved in detecting and filtering threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team found that functional MRI (fMRI) brain scans supported these results, further revealing that when infectious avatars were shown there was a greater connection between this threat-detection network and part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which acts as a key regulation centre for the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team also found differences in participants’ blood when they were shown the infectious avatars compared with neutral or fearful faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[In terms of cells], we saw mainly that there is an activation of an immune cell family called the innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)that [are] early responders in immunity to basically alarm other immune cells,” said Prof Camilla Jandus of the University of Geneva and an author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team added that they found a similar activation of ILCs when they examined the blood of individuals who had received an influenza vaccine but had not been exposed to the VR setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Esther Diekhof of the University of Hamburg, who was not involved in the work, said the study chimed with previous research, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912500025X#:~:text=Perceiving%20sneezing%20and%20sick%20individuals,to%20increased%20release%20of%20sIgA." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;including that of her own team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The study provides yet another good example for the existence of a mechanism that responds to potential contagion threats even before the immune system has come into contact with pathogens,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Prof Benedict Seddon, of University College London, said questions remained, including whether the observed responses help the immune system actually fight an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When we get infected, by Sars-CoV for instance, it can take a day or two for the infection to establish and for the immune system to become aware of it and respond, a long time after the initial encounter that stimulated this short-lived mobilisation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNMUJPN2E2VUdBUkwxTzVzbFFSVjBuUHY5U2w1T2J5eDhyZ1ZHZ09oSFN3Vng5REtGNHpiQThlNUlaaGdGV0tCalYzSVZxNjhwdWpkeXpzSmUwZjUzS3lCcmZuU1d5R2k2b1pFZEVHeXRrX21PYmdNcGJnUVVkUFotX1lyNUp0WkNsVTliYkpsWGJrdFNmWHNPXy1kN3VOWFcyeVpFdUFwMEZIN0NNZTU5ODB6dHh3QkQza2dSQ0hieS1XcVVKVGhr</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员说，斯托宁顿的狂犬病检测呈阳性-补丁</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPOW90THRKMEREc2dUNGpLVkViN2RHSXEyT1k5TGRTYlEzb3k5d1BaWXJWMTNHek5xS0xCWDB6anV4c2IzckVCeElNdEhhZEdjU2IwSHNpWThJZW81cHdhd1NyQVZfUUxBLVF1OURubGF4clhmaVY3blAzTXBtS1Z0OEdsd2hYSGlCZk1Eb1ROelBvRkFSekd2REpqZ1lxeVl0S2ZZ0gG-AUFVX3lxTE9WX1BiekpTamVwdGhOVnUtMTYzSWtPYUtTRDFvVXplbFFOd2dWZWtIZXNHMEw5RlhmZDRjUHBNV2RUdm9aaUQ3S28xZzBEZ0ZRbzJhOWJoWnRsNEkwRXljc213Q2ZpM1BTWUJZbV95SnBDWmFsaF9veXVsZS1rSm5WcV9CdmUxWFJyYUc2TnZVRTZwVG9JWWhvTllSeVBGUnc1RXNnN3BQQW5TeEVKRmxBODZTOVBVT3BvNHBjUlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONINGTON, CT — A racoon found on Wamphassuc Road in Stonington tested positive for rabies on Friday, according to a statement from the Ledge Light Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the third animal to test positive for rabies in the area this month.

"It is spread mostly by wild animals, but stray cats and dogs may also become infected and spread the virus. The rabies virus lives in the saliva and brain tissue of infected animals. Rabies can be spread by scratches from infected animals or when infected saliva comes into contact with open wounds, breaks in the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.)"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health district also gave the following advice to residents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refrain from feeding or approaching wild or stray animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets up to date on their rabies vaccines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit your pets' unsupervised time outside&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or concerns, contact Ledge Light Health District at 860-448-4882 or Stonington Animal Control at 860-599-4411.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:40:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPOW90THRKMEREc2dUNGpLVkViN2RHSXEyT1k5TGRTYlEzb3k5d1BaWXJWMTNHek5xS0xCWDB6anV4c2IzckVCeElNdEhhZEdjU2IwSHNpWThJZW81cHdhd1NyQVZfUUxBLVF1OURubGF4clhmaVY3blAzTXBtS1Z0OEdsd2hYSGlCZk1Eb1ROelBvRkFSekd2REpqZ1lxeVl0S2ZZ0gG-AUFVX3lxTE9WX1BiekpTamVwdGhOVnUtMTYzSWtPYUtTRDFvVXplbFFOd2dWZWtIZXNHMEw5RlhmZDRjUHBNV2RUdm9aaUQ3S28xZzBEZ0ZRbzJhOWJoWnRsNEkwRXljc213Q2ZpM1BTWUJZbV95SnBDWmFsaF9veXVsZS1rSm5WcV9CdmUxWFJyYUc2TnZVRTZwVG9JWWhvTllSeVBGUnc1RXNnN3BQQW5TeEVKRmxBODZTOVBVT3BvNHBjUlE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，您实际上可以在丧亲后死于心碎- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPckdTa0JTdXBXMlhEd3R0bFYxNEZWOWNldXFxNng4cnFndzk5bXA1a25sNkNSQ19WQU9uSFpuc2ROM2drMm0zQUJjMzdaRHpvVmRzZ0QwRFRsYU5ZcFpXWlpKYUdDeDN6R0psZWNkX29WVzNkdHFEaVF0TTZhLXA1OTRaWGhWdU1VeWh4UGFQWXRfNjdsQnfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTXptcXcxS3lPQ2tWNFhSS1dHaVFRUUtWQUV6YnV4cGxzSDh1NFdPNlBWRXIyOU16dmZaNlkzbllzSDZuTzRtRjdZYnpLeHlSdGdwNWZJREIycnpfRG50bmNyRENLbkNvZWtSak5KaEdRXzJ2VDk5aFZmSzZkTXY0QzlGOUlydkFkTkQ0ZzF5Ylc1ZkdDdUJkM0x6VGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            You can actually die of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/health/men-broken-heart-syndrome-wellness"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; after the death of a loved one, especially if the grief is overwhelming, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0006356n45g64xml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/broken-heart-syndrome/index.html"&gt;Bereaved relatives&lt;/a&gt; who experienced “high levels” of grief symptoms were more likely to die in the 10 years following their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/health/broken-heart-syndrome-wellness"&gt;bereavement&lt;/a&gt; than those who experienced “low levels” of grief, a study published Friday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1619730/full" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/a&gt; found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0009356n5wt7fke5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, coauthor Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, a postdoctoral researcher&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at Aarhus University in Denmark, and her colleagues investigated the long-term health outcomes of bereaved relatives in Denmark over the course of 10 years, dividing the 1,735 participants into groups who experienced “low levels” and “high levels” of grief symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn61qfu0009356nherbzzb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the study period, 26.5% of the relatives who showed high levels of grief died, compared with 7.3% of those who were less powerfully affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn4f52j0002356nnrq2es7k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These “high levels” of grief are defined as someone experiencing more than half of nine grief symptoms researchers have identified. These include feeling emotionally numb or that life is meaningless; experiencing difficulty accepting the loss; and experiencing confusion over their own identity. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000c356n52iwerxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants were asked to fill in questionnaires when they first enrolled in the study, as well as six months and three years after their bereavement, allowing researchers to collect their symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000d356npwz18uns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time, researchers observed how often the study participants interacted with the health care system, finding that relatives with high grief symptoms also used more antidepressant medication, mental health services and primary care services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0007356nw9f9415i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those with a high grief trajectory seem to be a vulnerable group of relatives already before the death, with need for special attention,” Nielsen told CNN via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0008356nz86aiybo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(They) may need additional support. They may experience distress and have difficulties coping with the situation,” she said, pointing to previous studies that have highlighted low socioeconomic status, poor self-reported health, and higher symptoms of depression and anxiety as all contributing to overwhelming grief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0zqu60000356nprtqbm97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even accounting for these risk factors, the researchers have “done a good job” isolating the specific effect of grief, Sian Harding, a cardiologist and professor emeritus of cardiac pharmacology at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved in the research, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000a356nkpqd8vej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the “key things” about the paper is its longitudinal perspective, she said, since “we know very well that there’s an acute effect of any kind of bereavement on heart health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000b356nop8s64i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was not a particular surprise to me that this particular form of stress, while prolonged, has a damaging effect on the body. It can come out particularly as heart disease, but other things as well,” Harding added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000e356nk7q11a4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this study didn’t investigate the bereaved relatives’ causes of death, it aligns with wider research showing the effect a traumatic loss can have on a person’s physical health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn4qu880004356n28a7uoml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One cardiac condition known as broken heart syndrome — also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy — is a well-established acute phenomenon, triggered by intensely stressful situations, like losing a loved one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000g356ncnf9vx0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prolonged stress caused by bereavement can also cause raised blood pressure, raised cortisol, an increased risk of diabetes, and poor mental health, Harding said. She also noted previous research into broken heart syndrome that found that some people die on the anniversary of their bereavement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000h356nsnekp27i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Findings from the latest study suggest that healthcare workers “may be able to discover distressed relatives early in the patient’s illness trajectory and offer follow up,” Nielsen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Knowing magnesium deficiency symptoms can help you identify if you’re lacking in the mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Magnesium is one of those under-the-radar minerals that quietly powers hundreds of essential processes in the body,” says &lt;a href="https://simplywellnessllc.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samantha Peterson, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Samantha Peterson, R.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of Simply Wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While magnesium deficiency is rare, research consistently shows that 48% of Americans get less magnesium than they should, per the NIH. That’s because many of us don’t eat enough vegetables, which are naturally rich in magnesium, explains &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-barrett-7968a82/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Erin Barrett, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Erin Barrett, Ph.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of product innovation and scientific affairs at Shaklee. And many processed foods are stripped of minerals when they’re refined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, some people just need more magnesium than others, adds &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebalanceddietitian/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Davis, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amy Davis, R.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.weliveconscious.com%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65512522%2Flow-magnesium-symptoms%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Live Conscious;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Live Conscious&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; nutrition consultant.

Wen School of Population &amp;amp; Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since magnesium deficiency is rarely symptomatic, it can be hard to tell if you’re getting enough of the mineral. But, there are some subtle (and not so subtle) signs that you need more in your diet, according to experts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling tired, weak, or generally low on energy, your magnesium levels may be to blame. “Magnesium is essential for making ATP—the main energy molecule in your cells,” Barrett says. “Without enough of it, your body can’t produce or use energy efficiently, which can leave you feeling tired or weak.” This is one of the most common signs of low magnesium. And if you’re struggling to tell the difference between run-of-the-mill fatigue and true exhaustion, keep an eye out for “persistent fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest,” as Landry describes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Muscle cramps and spasms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low magnesium can make your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a33375083/muscle-cramps-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:muscles cramp;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;muscles cramp&lt;/a&gt;, twitch, spasm, and tingle—and in some cases, it may even cause seizures or repetitive eye movements (nystagmus), says Barrett. That’s because it regulates calcium and potassium, two nutrients that affect your muscles and nerves. “When magnesium is low, nerves and muscles become more excitable,” Barrett explains. That can cause your muscles to feel weaker, twitchier, or just different than usual. Think: “Waking with tight calves” or “having muscle cramps at night,” Peterson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anxiety or irritability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling stressed, anxious, or irritable for no apparent reason? Check your magnesium levels. “Magnesium is a key player in calming the nervous system,” Peterson says. It helps regulate your neurotransmitters, including feel-good chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, and fight-or-flight hormones like epinephrine. “When [magnesium is] low, the brain and muscles can go into overdrive, making you feel on-edge, tense, or mentally revved up,” she explains. This can leave you with unexplained stress or anxiety—or simply make you more irritable than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Irregular heartbeat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time you notice your heart racing or beating irregularly, you should tell your doctor. But in some cases, low magnesium may be the reason, per Barrett, Davis, and Landry. “Magnesium plays a role in stabilizing electrical activity in the heart,” Davis says. So low levels of the mineral can throw things off, making your heart rate fast or irregular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Headaches&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One lesser-known symptom of low magnesium? Headaches or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/migraines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:migraines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you start experiencing them more frequently. “Magnesium influences nerve transmission and blood vessel function in the brain,” Barrett says. “Deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of migraines in some people.” Though this low magnesium symptom won’t impact everyone, all four experts recommend keeping an eye out for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trouble sleeping&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low magnesium can make you feel tired, even when you’re getting enough sleep. But it can also impact your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. “If someone is feeling ‘wired but tired’ … or having trouble falling asleep despite being exhausted, I often take a closer look at magnesium,” Peterson says. Maybe your mind is racing at night, she says. Or maybe you just don’t feel rested, Barrett adds. Either way, low magnesium may be your problem, and more &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a42815152/magnesium-for-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium might help you sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium might help you sleep&lt;/a&gt;. But again, be sure to consult your doctor before adding anything to your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since magnesium helps regulate blood pressure, not getting enough of the mineral may increase your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a30915774/what-causes-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, per Barrett and Davis. “Magnesium helps relax blood vessel walls, supporting healthy circulation and normal blood pressure levels,” Barrett explains. And research suggests that upping your intake (through &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35524386/best-magnesium-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; or your diet) may lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease or stroke, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mood swings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low magnesium levels can leave you feeling moody, depressed, or unlike yourself, according to Davis and Landry. “Magnesium helps regulate [your] neurotransmitters and stress response,” Davis says. When these get thrown off, you might experience mood swings, what Landry calls “personality changes,” or even mild depression. “Think of [magnesium] as your body’s chill-out mineral,” Peterson says. “Without it, things start to misfire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Digestion issues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, low magnesium can impact your digestive system, causing &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65352322/best-time-to-take-magnesium-citrate-for-constipation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms like constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptoms like constipation&lt;/a&gt; and abnormal stools, Peterson says. Since these (and many low magnesium symptoms) can also be signs of other health conditions, look for other symptoms—like fatigue, muscle cramps, or stress—before assuming magnesium’s the culprit. “A red flag combo?” Peterson says. “Constipation and chronic stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugar cravings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly craving sugar? Low magnesium may be behind your sweet tooth, Peterson says. That’s because magnesium helps regulate your blood sugar, and low magnesium can make it harder to keep your blood sugar healthy, Barrett says. Blood sugar imbalances—like &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/hypoglycemia-low-blood-glucose/symptoms-treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hypoglycemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (low blood sugar) or &lt;a href="https://diabetesfoodhub.org/blog/high-blood-sugar-and-hunger" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperglycemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hyperglycemia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (high blood sugar)—can make you hungry, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weak bones&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium helps your body build healthy bones. “[It] supports bone structure and helps regulate calcium and vitamin D—two nutrients essential for strong bones,” Barrett says. Over time, not getting enough magnesium “may contribute to reduced bone density,” she explains. This can eventually lead to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20460075/what-you-need-to-know-about-osteoporosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:osteoporosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where your bones become weak, fragile, and easy to break, Davis and Barrett say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? If low magnesium is indeed the culprit, eating more &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60749717/foods-high-in-magnesium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium-rich foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; should quell your symptoms, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/matthew-landry/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Matt Landry, Ph.D., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Matt Landry, Ph.D., R.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor at UC Irvine Joe C.

Be sure to discuss your concerns with your doctor; they can do a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/magnesium-blood-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood test;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt; to see if your levels are low and provide you with a tailored plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you think of the nutrients you need every single day, your mind probably jumps to vitamin D, iron, or even calcium. One crucial mineral you might miss? &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/life/a20475017/health-benefits-of-magnesium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Magnesium is a very important mineral and is involved in more that 600 chemical reactions in the body,” explains Sonya Angelone, MS, RDN, CLT, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body after calcium, potassium, and sodium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, the average person only gets 50 to 66 percent of the magnesium they need daily, says Angelone. Why? Most Americans don’t eat enough magnesium-rich foods—like leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes—and load up on processed ones instead, where magnesium has been removed in the refining process, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while most people probably aren’t getting enough, true deficiency is less common. Your kidneys actually limit the amount of magnesium you flush out through your urine, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to consistently eating a diet heavy in processed foods, several health conditions (including diabetes and celiac disease), chronic alcoholism, and taking certain medications can bump your risk of true deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutrients work together to promote optimal health, and an inadequate intake of any nutrient, including magnesium, can lead to symptoms depending on the shortfall,” says Angelone. Here are six signs you’re not getting enough magnesium and how you can bump your intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:30:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1JTzRUaWc1RmhfY3p0YnRFQURaUjg3OC1kc1RRWTV6ZEZYS2hTUTdQcW5LSk9JaWktQ2dvelQ2WHpVVkJ6MUpfQy1rTzFyV0toX1cxR0k0QXZYUWdGSThhSnNPa2VvaHpIM2JMVg</guid></item><item><title>发病前12年与体力活动减少有关的心血管疾病- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPcENrM0dvQndyOENmSnlaRW51NnJKb3NESVVtdjI0X0FjZTItYXhpdGppcDA2NlhyeDdhaWNnWnZwYW1qbF9MakhOQS1ONFFrc19RaEF2UWFRb2RGUW5HVHc5SUtXZnU0YktzS1FIWWY3NVh4ekU3aXR5MWQ3UzNFTXFPZlVpMTZBY1lDQTdlTVlDUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-institution team of investigators report that adults who later develop cardiovascular disease show declining physical activity levels beginning roughly 12 years before their event, with the gap versus their healthy peers persisting long afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Physical activity serves as an essential countermeasure for both preventing and managing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Many adults do not meet recommended levels of moderate to vigorous-intensity &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, with substantial demographic differences in who stays active throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Trajectories of Physical Activity Before and After Cardiovascular Disease Events in CARDIA Participants," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2836452" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed complementary longitudinal and nested case-control analyses to evaluate moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity trajectories across adulthood, pre- and post-cardiovascular disease changes, alongside demographic variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, which included researchers from the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, and Tel Aviv University, analyzed data from 3,068 participants in CARDIA, a prospective study initiated in 1985–1986 with up to 10 physical activity assessments through 2020–2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohort analysis examined long-term trajectories across adulthood, while a nested case-control analysis assessed activity patterns around cardiovascular events. Participants were followed in four US cities with a median follow-up of 34.0 years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers measured moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity using exercise units, where 300 EU approximates 150 minutes per week of activity consistent with guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants self-reported activity using a validated questionnaire covering eight vigorous-intensity and five moderate-intensity activity types over the past 12 months. Cardiovascular events included &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coronary+heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, and heart failure, tracked through August 2020 and verified using medical records with trained physician adjudication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity decreased steadily from young adulthood into middle age, then stabilized in later years across the full cohort. Black men had a more sustained decline, while Black women consistently reported the lowest activity throughout adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White men showed initial decline followed by stabilization and slight recovery, while &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/white+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;white women&lt;/a&gt; began with lower activity than men but showed notable recovery beginning in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of 236 incident cardiovascular disease cases matched 1:1 to control participants revealed striking patterns around heart events. Activity levels in case participants began declining approximately 12 years before cardiovascular disease diagnosis, with accelerated declines within two years of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trajectories analyzed by cardiovascular disease type showed the steepest pre‑event decline in participants who later developed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+failure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, whereas those who experienced coronary heart disease or stroke declined more gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;After diagnosis, all three groups remained at similarly low physical‑activity levels (&amp;lt;300 exercise units), and the post‑event trajectory differences between disease types were not statistically significant (P = 0.90).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting for pre-cardiovascular disease activity levels, cases were more likely than controls to exhibit low activity post-cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.26–2.50).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black women faced the highest risk of low post-cardiovascular disease activity (odds ratio, 4.52; 95% CI, 2.29–8.89), while white men showed no significant increased risk (odds ratio, 0.92).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that physical activity declines from early adulthood to midlife then stabilizes, with notable demographic differences. Cases experienced steep declines before cardiovascular disease events, supporting a link between physical activity and disease outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that sustaining physical activity across the lifespan, especially for groups such as Black women, may help reduce cardiovascular risk and improve recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

'Since it didn't seem life-threatening, they sent me home.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mars' condition worsened, and she began throwing up every few hours. Concerned, she went to a different hospital and was told the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[They told me] "Your bloodwork shows you're fighting something, but it's not life-threatening,"' she recalled. 'Again, I was sent home.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;JaMarriae Lawrence, who goes by Mars, was working overnight at a Walmart distribution center in Virginia last year when she was hit with a 'sudden, excruciating' pain in her stomach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, that night, the content creator and singer began 'vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time.' Noticing how sick she was, her mom took her to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They ran more tests and finally discovered I was septic,' she shared. 'I was hospitalized. They gave me fluids and ran stool and urine cultures.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After running more in-depth tests, doctors found that she had C. difficile (C. diff) in her stool and Mycoplasma hominis in her urine, with Mars saying she contracted the virus from using a bathroom from someone who also suffered from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) is a type of bacteria that can cause inflammation of the colon, known as colitis, which can cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions. Mycoplasma hominis causes pain or burning during urination, genital discharge, and pelvic pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mars was treated with antibiotics and discharged after a week - but that wasn't the end of her medical nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt okay for a few months,' she recalled. 'Around the same time, I visited someone who had C. diff at the same time I did the previous year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used her bathroom and was shocked to find there was no soap. A month later, my symptoms returned,' Mars shared. 'I told my GI doctor that I suspected I had C. diff again. He ordered a stool test, which confirmed it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mars was put on an antibiotic called Dificid, which eventually cleared up her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mars was treated with antibiotics and discharged after a week - but that wasn't the end of her medical nightmare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After running more tests, doctors discovered Mars was septic. 'I was hospitalized. They gave me fluids and ran stool and urine cultures' she shared&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mars, who lives in Newport News, recalled the pain being so severe she couldn't even stand upright (stomach pictured during her ordeal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This whole ordeal began in April 2024, and I am only now beginning to feel relief,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'C. diff can be picked up anywhere. What I really want people to understand is this: we've become too comfortable with filth,' she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see people skip handwashing all the time. People go out in public while sick. They don't finish their antibiotics. And all of this leads to antibiotic-resistant superbugs,' Mars continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In elementary school, our teachers made us wash our hands before lunch. But where is that standard now — in middle school, high school, college? I think we've forgotten basic hygiene. I think we've forgotten empathy,' she declared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some say there's always risk of going to public places, which there is, but C. diff isn't a normal bacteria. It's strong. Contagious. And deadly,' Mars warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, 500,000 infections cause 15,000 deaths each year, as per the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15548-c-diff-infection"&gt; Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr. Steven Goldberg, Chief Medical Officer at HealthTrackRx, C. diff can be spread through toilets and bathrooms - especially in hospitals, nursing homes, or shared facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'C. diff is spread via spores that are shed in the stool of an infected person,' he told DailyMail.com. 'These spores can survive on surfaces like toilets, sinks, and medical equipment for weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Transmission typically occurs when someone touches a contaminated surface and then their mouth, or through healthcare workers' hands.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Goldberg added that spores can spread to others if high-touch surfaces like toilets, handles, and sinks are contaminated and not thoroughly disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The proper handwashing with soap and water is critical, as alcohol-based sanitizers do not reliably kill C. diff spores,' he urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[C. diff] most commonly leads to watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, and in severe cases, life-threatening complications,' Dr. Goldberg said. 'C. diff often occurs after antibiotic use, which disrupts normal gut bacteria and allows C. diff to overgrow.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:09:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNd0txd2FCcDhFX1RvMzRMM09LNWczT1JSYThoLUY0UFMwNm5SVWxaa1F4SEJTSW9nV2kxODBQY1JmeXJvazNPR01jTXlFaDVESUpIRGtPZDVEb0thTnduelV2dlBZZ0FKS2gxUEVCZVN0RjJSZ0Z4RFdUdUlFNV9MMVc4UEpaa0tTNzhFVzlucGl5T1dva0J5NTJpZWHSAaIBQVVfeXFMTTUxVG9GUzdjNzZMQi1MODMzTTlsdU5tYnRWS3FPRy1IOGtFM3REMTFZN1JZRUNVQ01LdGFCdjNVLUhYejBHa0dYS080bmJGMzBJYjBjekZVNDBPTnp0NXFCRmpzN3l4SXQ4bURHOHdPenNOcFlUb21lckdDSlVTZDBxYnBtTDJIdmszXzdMNndyWUZWX2xqMERYeWtyaDJHZGNn</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州脑食变形虫感染导致男孩死亡-《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNaXkzNGsybzh1MEFxWjdZMzBWdkhRUktwVVpzendZZnhxUlRGQkplSloyS0syMVJnZlpQUkFhQk45ajF2WHVIQnRIbnNPYldOUFdfaWM1QjN5d2FVSGRDVGRmUHk5NEhPal9xNm5vZnB1YU4zUWRxQzNSZHp4YmN1WGtQWkk3aG11dENOSVppU3lPOTBLWnFHbDMxNnRIVThaUjNoeGcydWY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNaXkzNGsybzh1MEFxWjdZMzBWdkhRUktwVVpzendZZnhxUlRGQkplSloyS0syMVJnZlpQUkFhQk45ajF2WHVIQnRIbnNPYldOUFdfaWM1QjN5d2FVSGRDVGRmUHk5NEhPal9xNm5vZnB1YU4zUWRxQzNSZHp4YmN1WGtQWkk3aG11dENOSVppU3lPOTBLWnFHbDMxNnRIVThaUjNoeGcydWY?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Infection from brain-eating amoeba kills boy in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lBaGFEZkRoRWFZV3RGZTRwaDhTZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 13:55:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNaXkzNGsybzh1MEFxWjdZMzBWdkhRUktwVVpzendZZnhxUlRGQkplSloyS0syMVJnZlpQUkFhQk45ajF2WHVIQnRIbnNPYldOUFdfaWM1QjN5d2FVSGRDVGRmUHk5NEhPal9xNm5vZnB1YU4zUWRxQzNSZHp4YmN1WGtQWkk3aG11dENOSVppU3lPOTBLWnFHbDMxNnRIVThaUjNoeGcydWY</guid></item><item><title>我刚刚经历了一场恶心而昂贵的考验。现在它又发生了，我会失去它。-石板杂志</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOdTdLZVdnRUZIOW5BbDM4TWVyV25FbERhVWNqbDljaWI0ZmR3N2x5N2E2RU9nQ1J1UmNOQWdTOGhEQ29zellPX3RmZHdrOWtWY2M5LXhNQkRHRE9ySXQwcmtjLTJTNi02TTE3eGxvbi1ySkQyOUNfRF9hbURjNmRwenRqSE02cEE1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn2zvb5006acqm6ib5og10n@published"&gt;A year and a half ago, I went through one of the most disgusting and stressful experiences of my life. It took all my emergency savings, and most of my mental reserves, to get through it. And now it’s happening again.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3mkdd000r3b77o93slvuw@published"&gt;Last year, for the first time in my life, my apartment had bedbugs. While my landlord covered the cost of the treatment, I had to burn through the majority of my “in case of emergency” savings to get the apartment prepped for fumigation and to replace the items that had to be disposed of. It was horrible, but I  was working under the assumption that I wouldn’t have to deal with this situation again anytime soon, and I got through it.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3sdui00123b77pnmussio@published"&gt;Well, here we are today, and it’s happening again. No bugs have been found in inspection, but some mystery bites and some mystery stains have meant that the whole process needs to be repeated. I feel like I’m on the brink of a mental collapse. I’m exhausted, stressed, and embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="167" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3t2cb00153b77qsnle7bq@published"&gt;But also, I don’t have the money to cover it again! My savings still haven’t recovered from the last time, and the costs are adding up so fast. My parents have offered me a no-interest loan, and my sibling has come through with making sure I still have clothes to wear and a sympathetic ear to talk to. I feel so privileged and grateful to have a family that loves me and supports me, but I feel so bad about even needing it in the first place. I live several hours away from anyone in my immediate family, and my parents have also offered to fly in from out of town so that I’ll have a hotel to stay in for a few nights and so they can help me unpack once the treatment is done. When they offered this to me, I started crying in relief but also with guilt, since it’s now going to cost them even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money than what they’ve already given me.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3lt45000h3b77y0omo53l@published"&gt;The loan and the support are being graciously given: no guilt-trips, no digs. But I can’t shake the shame I feel not being financially stable enough to handle it myself. The fact that there are signs of an infestation but no actual bugs seen yet are also making me feel like I overreacted (even when my landlord has made it clear this isn’t a situation to under-react to). It all feels so wasteful and irresponsible in a way that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make any logical sense but that I can’t get out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

They can wreak havoc on your mental wellness, physical health and, as you’ve seen, your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3ltdx000l3b77wr6y3ztw@published"&gt;Let’s start by separating out your financial issues from your emotional ones. On the financial side, you’re broke, in debt to your parents, and worried about running up the bill beyond what they can afford. Those are all real concerns and they are legitimately anxiety-producing. On the emotional side, you feel indebted to your parents, embarrassed that you can’t pay your own way, and angry you’ve been forced into a place where you’ve used up all your savings paying for someone else’s problem. Cue an additional level of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3ltj9000m3b7760jykvnv@published"&gt;If you can’t live in your apartment because of a pest infestation, you shouldn’t be paying rent. Ask the landlord for a rent abatement while the property is being treated and for the time you couldn’t live in the apartment the last time it happened. If they refuse, look up your local landlord-tenant code and see what it says about the landlord’s responsibility to manage and eradicate pest infestations and what they owe you, the tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3ltla000n3b77kxuiqbuc@published"&gt;You didn’t say where you live, but New York City has some of the strongest tenant protections and most stringent requirements when it comes to pest infestations, particularly bed bugs. The &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/HousingMaintenanceCode.pdf"&gt;New York City Housing Maintenance Code&lt;/a&gt; (Section 27-2017.2) requires landlords to keep premises free of rodents and insects and tenants have the right to a bedbug-free environment. Bedbugs are specifically named in the list of insects that building owners are legally required to eradicate. Chicago and California (on the state level) also have strong tenant protections.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s no short-term fix, other than &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/money-advice-lottery-ticket-roommate.html"&gt;winning the lottery&lt;/a&gt;, which as I’ve written about isn’t exactly a winning strategy. Instead, thank your parents for their love and support. Then, start to map out a longer-term life plan that will give you the financial wherewithal to live your life on your terms, including finding a new job, adding in some side-hustles and for sure finding a new, bug-free place to live.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn2zvb5006dcqm66f2xx6hf@published"&gt;I’m not a neat freak. I’ve heard people sometimes do things like clean their baseboards, but I’ve never done it myself, and it doesn’t bother me. That’s my baseline for what comes next. What bothers me is clutter and trash. I feel like I have a pretty normal threshold for not wanting “stuff” on the floor, tables, counters, etc. My wife is less bothered by messiness. She’s not a hoarder. But lived for years with a hoarder roommate, with that level of actual trash in the hallway between our bedrooms, and it didn’t really bother my wife. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/04/house-cleaning-wife-personal-finance-advice.html"&gt;I’m trying to find a middle ground on picking up after ourselves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — Monday, July 28, is World Hepatitis Day and the &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/hepatitis-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;South Carolina Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; (DPH) wants you to join in the observance and get tested for for the virus at a local DPH public health clinic near you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Hepatitis C&lt;/a&gt; is commonly known as the "silent" infection because people can live for years without showing signs of the disease while liver damage is occurring. Nearly 40% of people with hepatitis C being unaware of their status and many who are diagnosed aren’t aware that treatment is now fast, simple and effective. DPH says anyone can be at risk but certain groups are more prone to getting hepatitis C:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis C is spread when blood from an infected person — even microscopic amounts — enters the body. You can prevent transmission by:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment for hepatitis C is easy and 95% effective. It can be cured in as little as 8-12 weeks with oral medications rather than interferon therapy involving painful injections.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hepatitis C treatment has come a long way since the 1990s,” said Dr. Linda Bell, State Epidemiologist. “As compared to previously availability treatments, with the newer direct-acting antiviral medications, about 95% of people with hepatitis C infection can be cured within about three months with a daily pill that causes few side effects. This is exciting progress and why everyone should know their hepatitis C status."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DPH, approximately 1,900 cases of hepatitis C were diagnosed in South Carolina in 2024, with Richland, Greenville and Horry counties having the highest number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been at risk, or are unsure of your hepatitis C status, get tested. If you have the infection, get treated and get cured. Preventing the complications of hepatitis C is possible and the first step starts with awareness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Yet we have the tools to stop hepatitis,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral hepatitis – types A, B, C, D, and E – are major causes of acute liver infection. Among these only hepatitis B, C, and D can lead to chronic infections that significantly increase the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. Yet most people with hepatitis don’t know they’re infected. Types B, C, and D affect over 300 million people globally and cause more than 1.3 million deaths each year, mainly from liver cirrhosis and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hepatitis D now classified as carcinogenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00403-6/abstract" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;classified hepatitis D as carcinogenic to humans&lt;/a&gt;, just like hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis D, which only affects individuals infected with the hepatitis B, is associated with a two- to six-fold higher risk of liver cancer compared to hepatitis B alone. This reclassification marks a critical step in global efforts to raise awareness, improve screening, and expand access to new treatments for hepatitis D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO has published guidelines on &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240090903"&gt;testing and diagnosis of Hepatitis B and D in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, and is actively following the clinical outcomes from innovative treatments for hepatitis D,” said Dr Meg Doherty, incoming Director of Science for Health at WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with oral medicine can cure hepatitis C within 2 to 3 months and effectively suppress hepatitis B with life-long therapy. Treatment options for hepatitis D are evolving. However, the full benefit of reducing liver cirrhosis and cancer deaths can only be realized through urgent action to scale up and integrate hepatitis services – including vaccination, testing, harm reduction, and treatment – into national health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Latest data and progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, the majority of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have strategic plans on hepatitis in place and progress in national hepatitis responses is increasing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;in 2025, the number of countries reporting national hepatitis action plans increased from 59 to 123; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as of 2025, 129 countries have adopted policies for hepatitis B testing among pregnant women, up from 106 reported in 2024; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;147 countries have introduced the hepatitis B birth dose vaccination, an increase from 138 in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, critical gaps remain in service coverage and outcomes, as stated in the &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240091672"&gt;2024 Global Hepatitis Report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;testing and treatment coverage remain critically low; only 13% of people with hepatitis B and 36% with hepatitis C had been diagnosed by 2022;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;treatment rates were even lower – 3% for hepatitis B and 20% for hepatitis C – well below the 2025 targets of 60% diagnosed and 50% treated; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;integration of hepatitis services remains uneven: 80 countries have incorporated hepatitis services into primary health care; 128 into HIV programmes and just 27 have integrated hepatitis C services into harm reduction centres.&lt;p&gt;The next challenge will be to scale up the implementation of prevention, testing and treatment coverage. Achieving WHO’s 2030 targets could save 2.8 million lives and prevent 9.8 million new infections. With declining donor support, countries must prioritize domestic investment, integrated services, better data, affordable medicines, and ending stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Forging new partnerships&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark World Hepatitis Day, WHO is partnering with Rotary International and the World Hepatitis Alliance to strengthen global and local advocacy. This year’s campaign &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Hepatitis: Let’s break it down&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; demands action to confront the rising toll of liver cancer linked to chronic hepatitis infections. It also calls for decisive steps to dismantle persistent barriers – from stigma to funding gaps – that continue to slow progress in prevention, testing, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a joint &lt;a href="/news-room/events/detail/2025/07/28/default-calendar/global-hepatitis-webinar-let-s-break-it-down!"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt; and coordinated outreach, the partnership underscores the vital role of civil society and community leadership, alongside governments, in sustaining momentum and accelerating progress toward hepatitis elimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When it’s acute, it tends to start suddenly, with an obvious cause (like a broken bone) and a standard fix. But chronic pain, experienced by 1 in 5 adults in the United States, persists for more than three months (or beyond an injury’s expected healing time). And it sometimes doesn’t have a clear cause. So if you have chronic pain, how can you find relief and improve your quality of life? “We’ve learned a lot in recent years about the major differences between acute and chronic pain, which require vastly different approaches,” says Kimeron Hardin, a clinical psychologist and president of the American Association of Pain Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T2HA77FFDZG33OOI756EFKY7TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chronic pain goes beyond the sensory experience of “how much does it hurt and where does it hurt?” says Steven P. Cohen, an anesthesiology professor and vice chair of research and pain medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Our thoughts, emotions and behavior can significantly affect the physical sensation of chronic pain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GZWA7WCR7BFKDNRVYSXOSVNZYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medication, physical therapy, steroid injections and implanted devices may be helpful, but newer research has discovered that techniques that target the psychological aspects of pain can also provide relief. In this article, we look at three such treatments. Ask your primary care provider if any of these might be an option. They can refer you to a licensed mental health professional who specializes in chronic pain. You can also find specialists at &lt;a href="http://aapainpsychology.org/" target="_blank"&gt;aapainpsychology.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AAIGDAFO5ZBK3LMVRARSNABZFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This is a form of talk therapy that helps people identify negative thoughts and behaviors and develop skills to change them. For people with chronic pain, expecting the worst or focusing on the pain can actually increase the discomfort they feel. “Many people have fear-based or catastrophic thinking around pain that can make pain worse,” Hardin says. “CBT can help you understand patterns that might be exacerbating your pain and teach you how to recognize and replace those thoughts with something that’s soothing, comforting and even more accurate.” A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub4/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 Cochrane Review&lt;/a&gt; found that CBT led to a small but significant reduction in disability and distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RNP5PMQVUZDUZKPCR45VAKDW4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This has some things in common with CBT but adds in mindfulness techniques. And while CBT focuses on changing the way people think about their pain, ACT helps people accept their pain and commit to lifestyle changes that will lessen its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GMJ53ZGQWRHALABKTY4REUBFYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such changes are standard advice for conditions like high blood pressure, and they can be helpful for treating chronic pain, too. Physical inactivity, stress and poor sleep are all linked to more severe chronic pain. ACT also helps people distill what matters most to their quality of life, such as family time, and then figure out which actions can facilitate that despite the pain. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228207/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 25 trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ACT helped reduce disability and depression and improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCZF2MXEX5CH7LDTRA2TML5KEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People with chronic pain that has no identifiable cause — such as fibromyalgia and some back pain — may become overly sensitive to stimuli such as pressure or heat, a process called central sensitization. Pain resulting from altered pain processing “means there’s no clear injury or nerve damage,” says Christopher Robinson, a physician-scientist in the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y35EODHFTNFE3DEXTGICPHBYCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy is an emerging technique that helps the brain “unlearn” this type of pain. Therapists have people engage in movement they fear will cause pain — such as bending — while training them to perceive their sensations as a result of nondangerous brain activity rather than tissue damage. It aims to silence what may be thought of as a false alarm from the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYPWMUBXW5A2FGNPR63ZFFM34Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8482298/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that two-thirds of people with chronic back pain who received four weeks of pain reprocessing therapy were pain-free or nearly pain-free after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hyvuql-isBold-true wpds-c-esEUdQ-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2025, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

ROACH: I am a 75-year-old woman in reasonably good health. Two months ago, I had a seizure in my doctor’s office during my annual checkup. I woke up in an emergency room in a large metropolitan hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IHBMSG5AEJE6ZFPJKTXHW4LCKQ"&gt;I take ramipril for high blood pressure, which is controlled. I am now taking levetiracetam for seizures. I have never had a seizure before and know of no one in my family who has had one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z7VRDQFZPJFG7G7BABEP3BOCSY"&gt;Initially I had a CT scan that showed nothing. Two weeks later, I had an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was clear and an MRI. No tumors or aneurysms were found. I am waiting to have a follow-up consultation with the neurology department. All my blood work was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H67JCVKORZHYVNCQFEOTHVAPBE"&gt;My own general physician said that there might be an age-related disease in the small blood vessels of my brain. What does this mean? She would offer no more information. I suppose she thinks that I should see the assigned neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J2AVVHSEXNG4ZHUFAUYCF6QJYA"&gt;I am in shock about this latest development in my health. I had low to normal blood pressure until I turned 70. In January, I had the worst case of the flu (worse than COVID). I was tested for COVID and was negative. Could this flu have been a factor in my having the seizure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PU67WI2MVVEEVH3Z6ZRXFREF5E"&gt;Is there anything that you can suggest to prevent further seizures? I’ve had no symptoms since and seem to be tolerating the medication well. -- D.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JLPIYXSVFVA5JNC2PJC2IJEDTA"&gt;ANSWER: A new onset of a seizure in a person aged 75 is very concerning, and a thorough evaluation is mandatory. There are many possible causes, and one of them is a tumor, which is one reason they did the MRI. It’s very good news that there was no tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IEMHFYEJAFCSBNQAVDDT6DNQKM"&gt;Age-related changes in an MRI are common, and if there has been damage to the brain due to blood vessel changes, this can be a source of seizures. (Between 30% and 50% of new seizures in older adults are due to blood vessel disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGTGANZ64RFRRJSRIHT7I2I444"&gt;COVID, especially severe COVID, can cause damage to the blood vessels. Most cases of the flu are less inflammatory than COVID, but I suppose it is possible that the flu affected the small blood vessels in your brain. However, if the small blood vessels in your brain really are damaged, I think it more likely that the high blood pressure caused the damage to the blood vessels from when your blood pressure wasn’t as well-controlled than it being due to COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A5ITSDJCMJATTIGVNRLDMXDOEU"&gt;However, many times we cannot find an answer as to why a person has a seizure. As far as treatment, I, too, would await the decision of the epilepsy-trained neurologist, but most recommendations I read would defer long-term treatment in a person with only one seizure when no cause can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5JHLXZZAUJGKZPGALAJZSZONEU"&gt;A normal EEG also tends to make me think that the expert would recommend that you hold off on immediate treatment unless you have a second seizure. Still, the neurologist will look at all your data, especially the brain and blood vessel imaging, then give you a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;CORRECTION: In the July 10 column, we stated that vitamin D “may help people with high-risk prediabetes develop overt diabetes.” It should have read “prevent” rather than “develop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FETIGQSX7RGXHCUX6Z6GTOB25Q"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

A bloody scene from Grey's Anatomy, or a putrid peek at Dr. Pimple Popper squeezing pus-filled blemishes. It's like we can't help ourselves, even if our stomachs are churning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;Some scientists believe it's because viewing such content from a safe distance allows us to be both disgusted and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;curious&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. Both are evolutionary feelings. And both can protect us. But more on that later...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;First, we're going to test your ability hold down your breakfast while scrolling through some rather unsettling &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/medical-pics-medicalpedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;medical images&lt;/a&gt;. From a really creepy-looking medical dummy, to an x-ray of a brain after a piece has been removed... &lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; has put together a list of "look away but not quite yet" medical photographs shared by people online. Each image tells its own story, and all provide a window into a world that we wouldn't ordinarily see.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-items clearfix "&gt;  &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering why you can't stop scrolling through this list even though a part of you is begging you not to? Don't worry. You're not alone... “People are often drawn to things that bother them,” &lt;a href="https://qz.com/997516/the-psychological-reason-you-love-watching-online-videos-that-gross-you-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alexander Skolnick, a psychologist who studies disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disgust is an important emotion. It's meant to protect us. "We tend to feel it when there’s something harmful around," explains Quartz. "We know &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/snake-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;snakes&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/cute-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; mean danger. Vomit means something made someone else sick. Poop carries diseases. When we see any of these, we naturally want to avoid them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, curiosity calls on us to explore and learn more about the world. Including those things that can be harmful to us. Viewing unsettling or gross content allows us to feel disgust and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;curiosity&lt;/a&gt; together. Basically, we can be a bit disgusted, while still using the images or videos to protect ourselves in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it is about experiencing these things in safe ways,” Skolnick explains. “It’s gross, but it’s not you…it’s something you can turn off. You have power over it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9027212"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her name is Harriett and she was a maid employed at drexel university college of medicine, now the medical college of pennsylvania.

She's the director of the Environmental Health Group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. And says that disgust is specifically about things that might make us sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might dislike the taste of cheese, but it’s not going to necessarily make you sick," &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zjx4rj6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Curtis. "You might be disgusted by the sight of a cockroach sitting on that plate of cheese - because the cockroach has probably come out of the toilet and is carrying pathogens on its feet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, our ancestors relied on disgust to survive. Feeling disgusted helped them avoid harmful bacteria in rotting food, toxic water, waste and dead animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Humans with a strong sense of disgust not only stayed healthier, but would have been seen as a more attractive mate and passed on those 'disgust genes’ to their offspring," BBC &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zjx4rj6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who had a ‘healthy squeamishness’ would have gone on to have more children and practised good hygiene, and that would have protected their children,” explains Curtis. “Those who didn’t have that squeamishness would have simply died out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disgust comes with a physiological reaction. And there are steps to feeling disgusted... The first is paying attention. The gross thing makes you stop what you’re doing and check it out, without getting too close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, you might squirming or sweat. "Your palms go clammy, your hands go up and you stay away from touching the thing - or dropping it if you ignored step one," Curtis told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9027210"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He proceeded to memorize a medical textbook just before hand and all the patients survived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://bit.ly/4lReKPi" target="_blank"&gt; ImSoFrickinPissed &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/an-identity-thief-stole-the-identity-of-a-surgeon-and-while-aboard-a-navy-destroyer-was-tasked-with-performing-several-life-saving-surgeries-2/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could very well pulling a face. Perhaps you stick out your tongue out or close your mouth up tight. "Your tongue is simulating pushing the thing out of your mouth and keeping it out, just in case," explains the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step, which many of us have experienced, is gagging. "Especially if it’s a food-related disgust response, your stomach starts to churn to discourage you from ingesting it, and prepare you to throw up in the event you did," reads the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9046402"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Didn't Expect To See I Have A Condition Where My Hearts Artery And Vein Has Been Flipped To The Opposite Sides Of Each Other At Birth, Which Is Apparently Rare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://bit.ly/4lGWbh1" target="_blank"&gt; QuizzicallyTrans285 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/went-to-get-a-scan-for-practicing-medical-students-i-was-a-volunteer-modle/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;          &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9027211"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common trope at the time was that of “A Student’s Dream” — where the medical student was being dissected by his cadavers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://bit.ly/3TSqMM7" target="_blank"&gt; naturebeatsnurture &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/as-photography-became-more-common-an-odd-tradition-emerged-medical-students-taking-pictures-with-their-cadavers-as-sort-of-a-first-portrait-into-the-medical-field/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9046743"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dupuytren contracture is a painless condition that causes one or more fingers to bend toward the palm of the hand.

A relative afferent pupillary defect was observed, and retinal examination showed an occlusion of the central retinal vein. The abnormal pupillary response was caused by retinal ischemia. A hypoperfused retina exudes angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). New vessels formed on the pupil (Panels A and B show low and high magnification, respectively) and also in the angle, the aqueous drainage system that surrounds the iris. Angiogenesis in the angle can occlude the drainage pathway, causing glaucoma and the complication of a painful, sightless eye. Regression of iris neovasculature was achieved with the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and maintained with the use of scatter laser photocoagulation of the ischemic retina. The patient's vision in the affected eye remained unchanged, and hypertension was the risk factor associated with this ocular vascular occlusion. Owing to the severity of disease at baseline, there was no visual improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://medizzy.com/feed/17788152" target="_blank"&gt; DR MOHAMMED IRFAN &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/neovascular-festoons-on-the-iris/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9046715"&gt;   &lt;p class="shareable-post-image "&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="post-content-description submission-description "&gt;&lt;div class="bordered-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a condition that develops due to congenital failure of cerebellar vermis development that leads to blockage of CSF circulation.

Wen School of Population &amp;amp; Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Since magnesium deficiency is rarely symptomatic, it can be hard to tell if you’re getting enough of the mineral. But, there are some subtle (and not so subtle) signs that you need more in your diet, according to experts.&lt;br data-node-id="6.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fatigue" data-node-id="7" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re feeling tired, weak, or generally low on energy, your magnesium levels may be to blame. “Magnesium is essential for making ATP—the main energy molecule in your cells,” Barrett says. “Without enough of it, your body can’t produce or use energy efficiently, which can leave you feeling tired or weak.” This is one of the most common signs of low magnesium. And if you’re struggling to tell the difference between run-of-the-mill fatigue and true exhaustion, keep an eye out for “persistent fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest,” as Landry describes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="muscle-cramps-and-spasms" data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Muscle cramps and spasms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Low magnesium can make your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a33375083/muscle-cramps-treatment/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a33375083/muscle-cramps-treatment/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="muscles cramp" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;muscles cramp&lt;/a&gt;, twitch, spasm, and tingle—and in some cases, it may even cause seizures or repetitive eye movements (nystagmus), says Barrett. That’s because it regulates calcium and potassium, two nutrients that affect your muscles and nerves. “When magnesium is low, nerves and muscles become more excitable,” Barrett explains. That can cause your muscles to feel weaker, twitchier, or just different than usual. Think: “Waking with tight calves” or “having muscle cramps at night,” Peterson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anxiety-or-irritability" data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Anxiety or irritability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Feeling stressed, anxious, or irritable for no apparent reason? Check your magnesium levels. “Magnesium is a key player in calming the nervous system,” Peterson says. It helps regulate your neurotransmitters, including feel-good chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, and fight-or-flight hormones like epinephrine. “When [magnesium is] low, the brain and muscles can go into overdrive, making you feel on-edge, tense, or mentally revved up,” she explains. This can leave you with unexplained stress or anxiety—or simply make you more irritable than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="irregular-heartbeat" data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Irregular heartbeat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Any time you notice your heart racing or beating irregularly, you should tell your doctor. But in some cases, low magnesium may be the reason, per Barrett, Davis, and Landry. “Magnesium plays a role in stabilizing electrical activity in the heart,” Davis says. So low levels of the mineral can throw things off, making your heart rate fast or irregular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="headaches" data-node-id="15" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One lesser-known symptom of low magnesium? Headaches or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/migraines" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/migraines" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="migraines" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you start experiencing them more frequently. “Magnesium influences nerve transmission and blood vessel function in the brain,” Barrett says. “Deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of migraines in some people.” Though this low magnesium symptom won’t impact everyone, all four experts recommend keeping an eye out for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="trouble-sleeping" data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Trouble sleeping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Low magnesium can make you feel tired, even when you’re getting enough sleep. But it can also impact your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. “If someone is feeling ‘wired but tired’ … or having trouble falling asleep despite being exhausted, I often take a closer look at magnesium,” Peterson says. Maybe your mind is racing at night, she says. Or maybe you just don’t feel rested, Barrett adds. Either way, low magnesium may be your problem, and more &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a42815152/magnesium-for-sleep/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a42815152/magnesium-for-sleep/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="magnesium might help you sleep" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;magnesium might help you sleep&lt;/a&gt;. But again, be sure to consult your doctor before adding anything to your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="high-blood-pressure" data-node-id="19" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Since magnesium helps regulate blood pressure, not getting enough of the mineral may increase your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a30915774/what-causes-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a30915774/what-causes-high-blood-pressure/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high blood pressure" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, per Barrett and Davis. “Magnesium helps relax blood vessel walls, supporting healthy circulation and normal blood pressure levels,” Barrett explains. And research suggests that upping your intake (through &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35524386/best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35524386/best-magnesium-supplements/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="magnesium supplements" data-node-id="20.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; or your diet) may lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease or stroke, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="mood-swings" data-node-id="21" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Mood swings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Low magnesium levels can leave you feeling moody, depressed, or unlike yourself, according to Davis and Landry. “Magnesium helps regulate [your] neurotransmitters and stress response,” Davis says. When these get thrown off, you might experience mood swings, what Landry calls “personality changes,” or even mild depression. “Think of [magnesium] as your body’s chill-out mineral,” Peterson says. “Without it, things start to misfire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="digestion-issues" data-node-id="23" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Digestion issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In some cases, low magnesium can impact your digestive system, causing &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65352322/best-time-to-take-magnesium-citrate-for-constipation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65352322/best-time-to-take-magnesium-citrate-for-constipation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="symptoms like constipation" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;symptoms like constipation&lt;/a&gt; and abnormal stools, Peterson says. Since these (and many low magnesium symptoms) can also be signs of other health conditions, look for other symptoms—like fatigue, muscle cramps, or stress—before assuming magnesium’s the culprit. “A red flag combo?” Peterson says. “Constipation and chronic stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="sugar-cravings" data-node-id="25" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Sugar cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Suddenly craving sugar? Low magnesium may be behind your sweet tooth, Peterson says. That’s because magnesium helps regulate your blood sugar, and low magnesium can make it harder to keep your blood sugar healthy, Barrett says. Blood sugar imbalances—like &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/hypoglycemia-low-blood-glucose/symptoms-treatment" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/hypoglycemia-low-blood-glucose/symptoms-treatment" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hypoglycemia" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (low blood sugar) or &lt;a href="https://diabetesfoodhub.org/blog/high-blood-sugar-and-hunger" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://diabetesfoodhub.org/blog/high-blood-sugar-and-hunger" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyperglycemia" data-node-id="26.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.3.0"&gt;hyperglycemia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (high blood sugar)—can make you hungry, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="weak-bones" data-node-id="27" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Weak bones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Magnesium helps your body build healthy bones. “[It] supports bone structure and helps regulate calcium and vitamin D—two nutrients essential for strong bones,” Barrett says. Over time, not getting enough magnesium “may contribute to reduced bone density,” she explains. This can eventually lead to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20460075/what-you-need-to-know-about-osteoporosis/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20460075/what-you-need-to-know-about-osteoporosis/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="osteoporosis" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where your bones become weak, fragile, and easy to break, Davis and Barrett say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-bottom-line" data-node-id="29" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The good news?

                &lt;p&gt;At age 22, Emma Roma Jayne had no confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content creator and TikTok strategist, based in Australia, told Business Insider that she was very active growing up, but an injury forced her to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-exercise-doesnt-help-you-lose-weight-chart-fat-loss-2023-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stop playing sports&lt;/a&gt; and she "started piling the weight on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, Roma Jayne decided to get &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-bariatric-surgery" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;bariatric surgery:&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bariatric-surgery-weight-loss-changes-unexpected-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;weight-loss procedure&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the size of the stomach, meaning you can't eat as much and feel full faster. At the time, &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-loss-glp-1-drugs-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-effects-future-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt; like Ozempic weren't on her radar. Roma Jayne complemented the surgery with therapy to treat her eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of working on my mental health, I would just binge and eat and get the dopamine from food," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be eligible for the surgery, she had to commit to making &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/essential-healthy-habits-for-your-twenties-thirties-longevity-advice-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;serious, long-term lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; to prevent gaining the weight back, including having regular&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sessions with a nutritionist and a personal trainer for six months pre-surgery and two years after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People think that it's like a 'lose weight quick' thing. And that's all you have to do and you'll be happy and everything will be solved, but your hunger does come back," Roma Jayne said of bariatric surgery. "If I had those bad habits, that lifestyle that I had before weight loss surgery, I would 100% gain my weight back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data is mixed, but one a review of studies published in the journal Obesity Surgery found that up to 76% of patients regained a significant amount of weight six years after bariatric surgery. Reasons included the size of their stomach growing over time, inadequate support post-op, and patients struggling to break unhealthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Following the advice of her nutritionist,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Roma Jayne initially followed a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/protein-carbs-eat-more-lose-fat-gain-muscle-strength-training-2022-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;high-protein, low-carb diet to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;, started working out six times a week, and lost 132 pounds over two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years post-op, she's maintained her lower weight by mainly eating whole foods and being as active as possible. She has what she sees as a more balanced and sustainable approach to her diet and fitness routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne, now 24, shared the four habits that she said have helped her stay in shape.&lt;/p&gt;

After the surgery, she ate small portions and few carbs to lose weight, but she no longer excludes any food group as her focus is long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She still eats lots of protein as she learned that it helps her maintain her weight, but avoids &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-processed-food-expert-tips-for-avoiding-the-worst-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and prioritizes whole foods, which are linked to better overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne said that she eats nutritious, balanced meals, such as homemade pizza and wholemeal wraps, around 90% of the time, but isn't scared of the occasional sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I want to have chocolate, I'll just have some chocolate. I don't restrict myself too much," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roma Jayne's approach echoes what's known as the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-lost-weight-by-following-ratio-diet-rule-principle-2023-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;, or eating healthily 80% of the time and being more flexible the remaining 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians have told BI that this is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-nutrition-reporters-love-8020-rule-for-healthy-diet-2021-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sustainable way to eat &lt;/a&gt;and maintain your weight, because restrictive diets often lead to cravings, which make it harder to eat high calorie foods in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

"Just any way to get out and about," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

She focuses more on sustaining the healthy habits she has established than worrying about the exact number on the scale, as she knows they count for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My weight fluctuates so much, and I think it's just I know that I'm exercising well, I'm eating well, I'm healthy. So as long as I know that I'm doing my best, what is on the scales just doesn't really matter," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bmi-is-bogus-best-way-to-tell-if-youre-a-healthy-weight-2016-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Obesity experts&lt;/a&gt; agree that weight alone is not an accurate measure of a person's health. Other factors, such as how much muscle mass a person has and water retention, can increase the number on the scale. Plus, research suggests that where on the body the fat is located might have more bearing on a person's health than how much of it they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the biggest thing that's really helped me maintain these habits and maintain my weight loss is really just doing what's best for myself. And that's in every aspect of my life," Roma Jayne said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The passage of time may be linear, but the course of human aging is not. Rather than a gradual transition, your life staggers and lurches through the rapid growth of childhood, the plateau of early adulthood, to an acceleration in aging as the decades progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has identified a turning point at which that acceleration typically takes place: at around age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this time, the trajectory at which your tissues and organs age is steeper than the decades preceding, according to a study of proteins in human bodies across a wide range of adult ages – and your veins are among the fastest to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on aging-associated protein changes, we developed tissue-specific proteomic age clocks and characterized organ-level aging trajectories. Temporal analysis revealed an aging inflection around age 50, with blood vessels being a tissue that ages early and is markedly susceptible to aging,"&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt; writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, our findings lay the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of human aging through the lens of proteins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Humans Age Faster at 2 Sharp Peaks – Here's When&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-long-could-the-human-lifespan-get-the-answer-may-surprise-you"&gt;remarkably long lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-animals-lifespan-hints-at-how-well-it-copes-with-climate-change-says-study"&gt;most other mammals&lt;/a&gt;, but it comes at some costs. One is a decline in organ function, leading to a rise in risk of chronic disease as the years mount up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have a very good understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-major-feature-of-aging-might-not-be-universal-after-all"&gt;patterns of aging&lt;/a&gt; in individual organs, so the researchers investigated how proteins in different tissues change over time. They collected tissue samples from a total of 76 organ donors between the ages of 14 and 68 who had died of accidental traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These samples covered seven of the body's systems: cardiovascular (heart and aorta), digestive (liver, pancreas, and intestine), immune (spleen and lymph node), endocrine (adrenal gland and white adipose), respiratory (lung), integumentary (skin), and musculoskeletal (muscle). They also took blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team constructed a catalogue of the proteins found in these systems, taking careful note of how their levels changed as the ages of the donors increased. The researchers compared their findings to a database of diseases and their associated genes, and found that expressions of 48 disease-related proteins increased with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-could-be-putting-us-at-greater-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;, tissue fibrosis, fatty liver disease, and liver-related tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most stark changes occurred between the ages of 45 and 55, the researchers found. It's at this point that many tissues undergo substantial proteomic remodeling, with the most marked changes occurring in the aorta – demonstrating a strong susceptibility to aging. The pancreas and spleen also showed sustained change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169242" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169242" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642.jpg" alt="Study Reveals Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Suddenly Accelerates" class="wp-image-169242 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642-600x581.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169242" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Your body's organs according to ages they're most sensitive to aging. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their findings, the researchers isolated a protein associated with aging in the aortas of mice, and injected it into young mice to observe the results. Test animals treated with the protein had reduced physical performance, decreased grip strength, lower endurance, and lower balance and coordination compared to non-treated mice. They also had prominent markers of vascular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when"&gt;Previous work by other researchers&lt;/a&gt; showed another two peaks in aging, at around 44, and again at around 60.

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-habits-lower-belly-fat-women-over-50/" target="_blank"&gt;Belly fat&lt;/a&gt;—particularly &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-proteins-to-reduce-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;—is a major concern after the age of 50 that many choose to address at the gym. It’s caused by hormonal and metabolic changes and places you at a greater &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4127581/" target="_blank"&gt;risk of developing type-2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic conditions. To help get your midsection in top shape, we spoke with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.portiapage.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portia Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CPT, NCPT, PMA, ACE, and AFAA certified, a Pilates guru and Balanced Body Educator, who shares her #1 standing workout to melt belly fat after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of belly fat after 50 is a “big trifecta” of the following: hormonal shifts, the loss of lean muscle (sarcopenia), and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“Hormonal changes combined with sarcopenia are often the biggest drivers,” Portia tells us. “Estrogen helps regulate fat distribution; and when it drops, fat starts accumulating around the midsection. Add a gradual loss of muscle and you’re burning fewer calories at rest, which worsens fat accumulation—especially visceral (belly) fat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portia says muscle is a “metabolically active tissue,” meaning it torches calories even at rest. Once you hit your 30s, you begin to lose muscle mass at a rate of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/" target="_blank"&gt;3% to 8% every decade&lt;/a&gt;—and that rate accelerates after 50. Less muscle equates to a lower resting metabolic rate, and a lower metabolism means fewer calories burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sarcopenia also reduces insulin sensitivity, increasing the risk of insulin resistance—which further encourages abdominal fat storage,” Portia explains. “It’s a vicious (but reversible!) cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, she breaks down an effective standing workout that helps melt stubborn belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Standing Routine Reverses the #1 Cause of Belly Fat After 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-to-burn-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing workouts&lt;/a&gt; engage more muscle groups simultaneously (legs, core, postural muscles); demand balance and stability, activating deeper core muscles; elevate heart rate without high impact, supporting cardiovascular and metabolic health; [and] improve functional strength—which translates better into real-life movement and injury prevention,” Portia points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 15-minute standing workout burns fat and blends strength, cardio, and core stability. The best part? You don’t need equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform each exercise for 45 seconds, resting for 15 seconds in between. Rest for 60 seconds between rounds, completing three rounds in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see real results, Portia recommends doing this flow three to five times a week. Combine it with two to three days of resistance training and daily walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lift both arms overhead and interlace your fingers.&lt;/li&gt;

Some people can't start their day without a big breakfast first thing while others prefer to eat the most food at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb39e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, most people split their daily calorie intake up between three meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner (plus some snacks). Does it matter which &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/largest-meal-of-the-day-rcna219174" target="_blank"&gt;meal is the most caloric?&lt;/a&gt; Should you eat most of your calories for the day during a certain time window?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf328f" class="body-graf"&gt;In TODAY's expert tip, Collin Popp, Ph.D., dietitian and assistant professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, reveals how to time your daily calorie intake for the most health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ec8f9e" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Eat Majority of Your Calories Before Sunset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f12a27" class="body-graf"&gt;Most healthy adults should aim to get the majority of their calories earlier in the day, between the morning and early evening, about 5–7 p.m., Popp tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ed13a" class="body-graf"&gt;If you eat three main meals a day, that would mean breakfast and lunch are your largest or most caloric meals, compared to dinner and late-night snacks, Popp explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f341c" class="body-graf"&gt;If you tend to eat many smaller meals throughout the day, then try to shift these earlier so you only eat a minority of calories past the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-749330" class="body-graf"&gt;This timing of calorie intake, which Popp calls “front-loading," can be beneficial for your metabolic health, energy, blood sugar, and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b3b45d" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8441a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating most of your calories earlier in the day is optimal because it better aligns with the body’s 24-hour internal clock,  aka circadian rhythm, which regulates our sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8d1f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Our circadian rhythm also regulates our metabolism, hunger and energy levels. The goal is to eat the majority of calories between the morning and early evening because our metabolic response is greater, so we're able to utilize more energy from food, says Popp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-989e99" class="body-graf"&gt;In healthy people, their insulin sensitivity — how well the body responds to the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar — is also higher in the morning, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e7af" class="body-graf"&gt;Front-loading calories can also help fuel our body and brain to get through the day and curb hunger, which may prevent overeating at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fbea66" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701389" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; people who eat the majority of their calories at breakfast or lunch are more likely to lose weight than those who eat the most at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af7003" class="body-graf"&gt;Consuming the majority of calories later in the day or during the night is not optimal for health for several reasons, says Popp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3513af" class="body-graf"&gt;First, back-loading calories at night can interfere with sleep and disrupt digestion. By not aligning with our circadian rhythm, the body may not metabolize food and use energy as efficiently. Eating the majority of calories at night is associated with weight gain and unstable blood sugar levels, especially for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-0b83e4" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d5c5" class="body-graf"&gt;If you want to get a sense of how many calories you should be eating each day to maintain your current weight, you can use &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp" target="_blank"&gt;this calculator from the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ba68f" class="body-graf"&gt;Counting calories isn’t for everyone — fortunately, this tip only requires timing the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;majority (more than 50%) of your calories, says Popp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fedddf" class="body-graf"&gt;Here's an easy way to break down your daily calories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-7663ad" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast is 25-40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-lunch-to-lose-weight-rcna171471" target="_blank"&gt;Lunch&lt;/a&gt; is 30-40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dinner is 15–20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacks make up the remaining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf277e" class="body-graf"&gt;During each meal — but especially breakfast and lunch — aim to get enough protein, healthy fats and fiber, says Popp. Try to eat &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/protein-grams-per-meal-rcna197039" target="_blank"&gt;20–30 grams of protein per meal&lt;/a&gt; and 8-10 grams of fiber per meal (based on a recommendation of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/longevity-expert-tip-fiber-chronic-disease-rcna208086" target="_blank"&gt;25-30 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-370567" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

It was June 2021, and after months of virtual kindergarten, they sent their then-almost-6-year-old daughter to a summer program at a local school. The camp would be a brief reprieve before Amelia, an only child, started first grade, and Laura was sure she would love it. She was outgoing, the kind of kid who didn’t hesitate to approach someone new on the playground and start a game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizur1000q3b7877axe2h5@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;So Laura was surprised when, after the first day, Amelia told her she didn’t want to go back. At pickup a few days later, she pleaded again not to return. She said the woman who ran the camp often yelled and, at lunchtime, wouldn’t let Amelia leave the table until she finished all her food. Laura spoke to the woman — Amelia didn’t need to eat every morsel, she told her — and assumed the problem was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizuug000r3b78squ06w6x@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Camp ended, but over the next 12 months, Amelia would sometimes stuff her mouth with food, panic that it was too much to swallow, and spit it out. Laura told Amelia she needed to chew her food properly or she could choke. Amelia asked what would happen next. Two close family members had fallen severely ill with COVID, and one of them had died. Amelia became fixated on death. She wanted to know: What happens when you choke? You can’t breathe? Well, what happens if you can’t breathe? Then you die?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizuy2000s3b78q31jebpw@published" data-word-count="181"&gt;Amelia hadn’t been an anxious child, but she became increasingly sensitive to the world around her. She tensed up when people talked sternly; once, when a substitute instructor shouted in gymnastics class, Amelia rushed over to Laura and, through tears, begged to leave immediately. Her clothes started to bother her. At first, she didn’t want to wear dresses. Then she would wear only certain pants and a select few shirts. By the start of 2023, she was down to one outfit that Laura and Mark washed daily: a pair of fuzzy blue Cat &amp;amp; Jack pajamas with stars and planets and the cotton underwear she insisted felt more comfortable than all the others. When she tried to put on school clothes, “she’d work herself into a panic attack,” said Mark. “She’d say, ‘It’s too itchy. It’s too scratchy. It’s too tight. I can’t wear it. It hurts.’” At night, Amelia resisted falling asleep, convinced that if she closed her eyes, she might not wake up. Mark and Laura took turns in her room until she drifted off, which left everyone drained.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv1i000t3b78fs3ofxoz@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Her parents had her evaluated for autism, but doctors determined that while Amelia was hypersensitive, her behavior was rooted in anxiety. This made sense to Mark and Laura: Studies suggest that generalized anxiety disorder may run in families, and Laura had been diagnosed years earlier. As a child, she had an outsize fear of death; in adulthood, she tended to operate as though “everything is a fire drill,” she told me. If it took Amelia too long to get her shoes on or eat breakfast, Laura would grow frantic, worried that her daughter would be late for school and get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv4q000u3b78gr5lctu9@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;One day in January 2023, Amelia overheard Mark and Laura discussing the sign-up deadlines for different summer camps and began to fret. That evening, while eating a chicken nugget, she yelled out to Laura that she was choking. She had recently watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Baby-Sitters Club&lt;/em&gt; in which a character chokes on her dinner. That part of the scene lasts only ten seconds, but the camera focuses on the girl’s terrified face while she struggles to breathe. Amelia wasn’t actually choking — she could speak — but her whole body had clenched and made her feel as though she couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv8z000v3b78t19j76t4@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;Previously, Amelia ate a wide-ranging diet, but after the chicken-nugget incident, she began to refuse solid foods. Within a week, she would consume only yogurt and liquids. “We would buy every drink that she could possibly want — chocolate milk, juice. We were desperate,” said Laura. “And it got worse every single day.” Amelia cut out the yogurt, convinced she would choke on it. A couple of weeks later, she rejected liquids, too. She began spitting into a napkin, unable to swallow her own saliva. It felt like something was stuck in her throat, Amelia said. She believed if she did try to swallow, she would choke, suffocate, and die.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvc7000w3b786clevvhe@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;Dinner turned into a nightly standoff: Amelia on one side of the table, growing thinner and frailer, Mark and Laura on the other, their panic mounting. Sometimes, they tried coaxing her. Other times, they couldn’t help but yell. “We didn’t know how to deal with it. Like, ‘Why can’t you eat?’” said Laura. It felt like a failure. They tried to quiet their terror by leaning on what one may believe to be a biological fact — that humans are wired for survival and, eventually, a child will get hungry and want food. “I kept thinking, &lt;em&gt;Mother Nature’s going to kick in here,&lt;/em&gt;” said Mark, who asked that his family’s names be changed owing to the detailed account of his daughter’s medical history being shared. (Some other names have also been changed.) Instead, Amelia’s hunger response seemed to have shut off. If they tried to feed her, she would spit out the food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvf9000x3b78wz9fk4xj@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Doctors looked for a physical explanation for Amelia’s sudden inability to swallow. At urgent care, providers said they didn’t see any obstruction and told Mark and Laura to contact Amelia’s pediatrician, though when they called to set up an appointment, the pediatrician had no immediate availability. An ear-nose-and-throat specialist suggested Amelia might have eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that can be triggered by allergies or acid reflux. That doctor sent them home with nasal spray and antacids and suggested they see an allergist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvoc000y3b78uugeipcs@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;By the end of that February, roughly a month after she had stopped eating normally, Amelia weighed 37 pounds. Mark and Laura called doctor after doctor, including multiple psychologists, but those listed under their insurance no longer accepted their plan, didn’t treat patients that young, or couldn’t see them for six months. Amelia, increasingly malnourished, began screaming, cursing, and throwing things. “She was just turning into an animal,” said Mark. “We did not recognize our own daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvrs000z3b788fmjf2sa@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;The morning of February 22, Mark and Laura took Amelia to the emergency room. Doctors were alarmed — a blood test showed Amelia was in danger of heart failure. They transferred her to a hospital with a pediatric department, where a gastroenterologist inserted a feeding tube up her nose and into her stomach, allowing her to consume a nutrient-rich formula without swallowing. An endoscopy again confirmed the absence of a physical obstruction or abnormality. Finally, a doctor sat down with Mark and Laura and gave them a name for what their daughter was experiencing. They suspected that Amelia had &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/arfid-childrens-eating-disorder-vs-picky-eating.html"&gt;ARFID&lt;/a&gt;, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, a psychiatric diagnosis, often emerging in childhood, that can range from eating a very limited number of foods to refusing food altogether. Like many other parents, Mark and Laura hadn’t heard of ARFID. It seemed the numerous doctors who had seen Amelia over the past month hadn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvvh00103b78pa36oqi3@published" data-word-count="156"&gt;ARFID is a fairly new addition to the modern parenting lexicon: A behavior far more severe than pickiness, it’s an eating disorder provoked not by the desire to change one’s body but by the fear of food itself. Only in the past few years has the acronym begun circulating on playgrounds and in school nurses’ offices, and it’s not uncommon for parents to first stumble upon it on their own — on Reddit threads, in Facebook groups, on Instagram or TikTok. (This month, &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives of Orange County&lt;/em&gt; star Emily Simpson shared that her 10-year-old son has the disorder.) One mother told me she’d learned about ARFID after searching online, “Why is my 5-year-old eating absolutely nothing?” “&lt;em&gt;Bulimia&lt;/em&gt; came up. He doesn’t have bulimia,” she said. “Then I saw &lt;em&gt;anorexia,&lt;/em&gt; and I was like, &lt;em&gt;He doesn’t have anorexia.&lt;/em&gt; And then I scrolled more and it said, ‘Does your child have ARFID?’ And he had every symptom.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvyp00113b783u8i4nop@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;Doctors who specialize in eating disorders say they have seen an increase in diagnoses over the past several years, and a recent study found that, among children, the number of inpatient hospital discharges in which ARFID was the chief diagnosis doubled from 2017 to 2022. “There was this explosion almost six years ago, when we had a bunch of cases coming into the hospital,” said Heather Kertesz-Briest, a clinical psychologist who used to work at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Equip, a telehealth company specializing in eating disorders, treated more than 1,000 ARFID patients in 2024 — a 144 percent bump from the previous year. And Beat, a U.K.-based charity that runs eating-disorder hotlines, reports that there were nearly seven times as many calls about ARFID in 2023 than in 2018. There is limited data available, but one review estimates that up to 5 percent of the population has it, and a 2023 screen of 50,000 adults suggests it may be as common as anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizw7q00123b78f0nsw6ni@published" data-word-count="130"&gt;While classified as an eating disorder, ARFID may be more easily understood in many children as an anxiety disorder that centers on food. Its rise coincides with a pediatric diagnostic boom in mental-health conditions as more and more children are treated for generalized anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and ADHD — raising the question of whether they are a generation maladapted to the world around them or the first generation to be thoroughly understood. ARFID often orbits these diagnoses, a disorder that can become the most physical manifestation of what’s happening in a child’s mind. “That primal instinct to feed your kid, that is millions of years of evolution,” Mark said. “It’s scary for your kid to not eat and not drink and to not understand, &lt;em&gt;What’s going on here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

For decades, health professionals working in hospitals and eating-disorder clinics encountered patients who were severely underweight from not eating but who didn’t qualify for an anorexia diagnosis because they weren’t trying to lose weight or grappling with body dysmorphia — instead, they were disinterested in food, felt disgusted by it, or feared it. Twenty years ago, “the way we thought about some cases was that maybe the patient has anorexia secretly but they have a lack of insight into it,” said Jennifer Thomas, a psychologist and co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwhm00153b784h3w8l2g@published" data-word-count="179"&gt;Until 2013, the year ARFID entered the fifth edition of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&lt;/em&gt; the closest label was “feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood,” a code for children under 6. But the age cap made the label inapplicable to many patients, and it wasn’t widely used or researched. Unable to find meaningful literature on the condition, authors of the &lt;em&gt;DSM-5 &lt;/em&gt;spoke with psychologists and doctors who worked with eating-disorder patients and identified a specific patient profile: a person with sufficient access to food who wasn’t concerned with altering their body shape, and who restricted or avoided eating to a point where they lost significant weight, didn’t get enough nutrients, and/or experienced mental and social distress. These patients were, on average, younger and more likely to be male than those with anorexia. They lived not just in North America and Europe but also in Oceania, Southeast Asia, and Japan. When Thomas and her colleague eventually published a treatment manual for ARFID, they quickly got requests for editions in other languages, including Turkish, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwkv00163b783dzfcu73@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt; authors identified three presentations of ARFID, which themselves can feel like different diagnoses, though some patients fall into more than one category. One subgroup is made up of those who are simply uninterested in food, often from birth. Many were, as newborns, admitted into neonatal-intensive-care units, where they were put on feeding tubes. The tubes are lifesaving, but they bypass the tactile experience of eating, which can lead to an oral aversion. Some tube-fed babies struggle to develop hunger cues or learn the mechanics of swallowing. Years later, they may still lack the two major motivators to eat: They don’t feel hunger, and they don’t enjoy food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwo100173b78geng0sur@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;A second category is made up of people who have a sensory aversion: They tolerate certain tastes, smells, temperatures, and textures and feel disgusted by most everything else. Many of these patients are neurodiverse, and while it’s common for people with autism to have sensory sensitivity to food, “where ARFID rears its head is when the sensory experience is so discordant, so displeasurable, that it creates a full-body anxiety response,” said Matt Zakreski, a clinical psychologist who specializes in neuropsychological developmental disorders. “It’s analogous to the difference between having seasonal allergies and having anaphylactic shock.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwy200183b7850acp2vk@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;The most sudden ARFID cases fall into a third group: children like Amelia who develop a fear around eating, often after experiencing a traumatic event. Kellee Lanza-Bolen, a mother in Virginia, said her 8-year-old daughter stopped eating after choking on gummy candy she got in her Christmas stocking. The next month, her daughter was admitted to the hospital, where she was eventually diagnosed with ARFID and put on a feeding tube. Lanza-Bolen was confused; she had seen videos of Hannah Lea, a 9-year-old girl who chronicles her life with ARFID on Instagram and TikTok. But Hannah has sensory-processing issues. “When I heard ARFID, I said, ‘Well, no, because my kid doesn’t have sensory issues,’” Lanza-Bolen said. Her understanding of the disorder shifted once she learned it can be a response to a harrowing experience, similar to a person who becomes terrified of driving after a car accident. She now compares her daughter’s anxiety around swallowing to “the same fear that keeps you from getting too close to the edge of a balcony or the top of a building.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizx1o00193b78ekjy0eyx@published" data-word-count="213"&gt;As the disorder gained recognition, diagnoses naturally increased. The way Zakreski sees it, the embrace of the label stems from clinicians developing a more holistic understanding of the brain. “For a long time, we treated mental health through the medical model: You have a broken ankle, that’s it. You have pneumonia, that’s it,” he said. “Now, we know that any change to the brain predicts a lot of other changes, that one neurodivergence predicts other neurodivergences at a significantly higher rate.” One study, for example, suggests more than half of ARFID patients have autism, a disorder with a strong hereditary link and rising diagnostic rates. In Kertesz-Briest’s practice, nearly every single child with ARFID she sees also has an anxiety disorder, the most common mental-health diagnosis in adolescents. Meanwhile, food allergies, which can make eating feel like a fearsome game of roulette, are increasingly common among children, and William Sharp, the director of the Multidisciplinary Feeding Program at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said it’s no coincidence that more than 30 percent of his patients with a food allergy likely also have ARFID. Premature birth is also a known risk factor for feeding problems that can develop into ARFID, and as of 2023, nearly 10 percent of newborns are admitted into a neonatal-intensive-care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizx4r001a3b788wp8nj7n@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;ARFID, in other words, is poised at the juncture between the physical and the psychological, the genetic and the environmental — both something that’s existed under parents’ noses all along as well as a consequence of our contemporary age. And at a time when parenting culture is more attentive and anxiety-ridden than ever, the mystery ARFID presents mirrors the larger questions at the top of every parent’s mind today: How much control do we have over our children, or how much control should we exert? When does our vigilance contribute to our children’s anxieties, and when is it the only thing keeping them alive?&lt;/p&gt;

The clinic was disorienting. Amelia was the only 7-year-old there, and in the waiting room, her family found themselves sitting between toddlers with feeding issues and tween and teen girls. Mark gazed at the other parents, all of whom looked “like a bomb had gone off,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxgd001d3b78pt6sld9p@published" data-word-count="176"&gt;For the next few weeks, he and Laura split their time between the clinic and their home, three hours away with traffic. Their marriage, bruised by the past few months, began to buckle. “We had a ton of angst about, &lt;em&gt;How did we mess up our daughter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;” said Mark. “When your kid gets cancer, you can’t blame your spouse. When your kid has something more psychological, you start asking, &lt;em&gt;Did I cause this? Was this something I did or said? Was it something my spouse did or said?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;” Laura worried that Mark’s frustration with Amelia — he had gone from being the calm, steady parent to raising his voice — had unnerved her. Mark worried that it was Laura’s anxiety that had rubbed off. “Why did you tell her she’s going to die from choking?” he asked. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Amelia was in constant agitation. She tried to rip out her feeding tube. She screamed and spit, asking why the doctors weren’t helping her. Her mind was still making her body believe she couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxjp001e3b78xf97x1dy@published" data-word-count="180"&gt;ARFID, like the diagnoses it often accompanies, exists along a wide spectrum, with cases like Amelia’s at the most severe end. Many children with the disorder will eat but only from a very short list of foods. Those with a sensory aversion in particular tend to have rigid preferences, almost always gravitating toward carbohydrates. Jennifer Thomas, the psychologist who published the ARFID treatment manual, said this is true across cultures: In Boston, where she is based, the food of choice is Annie’s macaroni and cheese, while colleagues in Mexico see a preference for tortillas, and in Asia and the Middle East, rice. Processed and packaged foods — consistent in shape, size, and taste — are also deemed “safe” by children with ARFID, and doctors in the U.S. see a strong proclivity for McDonald’s chicken nuggets and frozen dinosaur-shaped nuggets. The difference between “safe” and “unsafe” can be minute — at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, kids getting treated for ARFID stopped eating the puréed chicken nuggets they had been consuming for weeks when the brand the hospital used tweaked its recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxmt001f3b78nn4rgp6a@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;In many ways, these cases can prove the most challenging to navigate. A child who won’t eat at all presents a clear crisis, while a child who eats a few specific foods and isn’t in imminent danger of starvation leaves more room to question what’s pathological and what’s not, what may just be a child asserting their independence and what warrants medical attention. Plenty of general practitioners still aren’t aware of ARFID, and one study found it can take almost three years to get a diagnosis after the onset of symptoms, more than double the average time for someone with anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxq4001g3b78oyb13tpi@published" data-word-count="189"&gt;Sarah, a mother in New York, was alarmed to learn from a teacher that her daughter, then in preschool, had been eating only apples for lunch and refusing everything else. The pediatrician assured her and her husband it would pass — in the doctor’s office, “the philosophy was ‘Well, she’ll eventually get hungry and eat the food that’s on the table,’” Sarah said. Maybe, they thought, their daughter was simply strong-willed. They agreed that accommodating her increasingly specific food requests would reinforce the behavior. Her diet moderately expanded. But when she was 8, she was being bullied at school, the family’s nanny left, and suddenly she wanted only applesauce for two weeks, saying anything else “hurts my body.” One night, when getting her daughter dressed for bed, Sarah was startled to see how thin she had gotten. At an eating-disorder clinic, Sarah’s daughter was diagnosed with ARFID. Later, after a full psychological evaluation, she was also diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder and flagged for possible autism. Now, Sarah stays alert to when her daughter wants more applesauce than usual, mindful that it could be a warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;

When Tania of Perth, Australia, got pregnant at 38, she decided motherhood “would be my next career.” She took courses on sleep training, read parenting books, learned how to blend her own purées. But after a traumatic birth that broke her son’s collarbone, followed by a series of respiratory infections and a tonsillectomy, her son, now 5, didn’t take to food, accepting only milk and bread. When she put blueberries on his plate, he would pretend to eat them before throwing them on the floor. Instead of bonding with her son at mealtimes as she had envisioned, Tania began to anticipate his resistance. Once, she said, “I put the food on the table and burst into tears.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxx9001i3b78uf58xq9h@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;Tania and her son’s world grew smaller. Mommy-and-me classes were stressful; he tired out easily from not eating enough, and she felt embarrassed when other parents pulled out lunch boxes with fresh fruit while her child ate only puffed snacks. Finally, a dietitian recommended a book called &lt;em&gt;Helping Your Child With Extreme Picky Eating,&lt;/em&gt; which described ARFID and included a chapter on parents blaming themselves for their child’s difficulty with food. Upon reading it, Tania said, “weights were lifted from my shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;

They worry that fellow parents think they’re lazy and don’t want to cook or that their whole family must subsist on Goldfish and chicken nuggets. (Some patients who eat a rigid diet of high-fat or high-carb foods may even be overweight. In a private ARFID Facebook group, a few parents post about their children being diagnosed with diabetes.) “Parents say to me, ‘Well, you just need to make sure they eat variety,’” said Sarah. While her daughter has ARFID, her other child eats almost anything. “I’m like, &lt;em&gt;We have all the fresh fruits and vegetables. My kids were raised exactly the same.&lt;/em&gt; In terms of nature versus nurture, their nature is completely different.” One Christmas Eve after being pressured to eat, her daughter with ARFID began hyperventilating at the table in front of their extended family. A relative pulled Sarah aside and told her such a disturbance can never happen again. “They think it’s misbehavior, that we aren’t disciplining her,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

As a newborn, her son had been put on a feeding tube; at 5, he suddenly stopped eating the short list of foods he had once tolerated. Mealtimes became “a fight to get every calorie into him. It was begging, pleading,” she said. Even after undergoing treatment, her son, now 7, still negotiates every bite. “He argues with us, like, ‘Well, if I eat this, how long will that give me to live?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizy7v001l3b780zh1mx7j@published" data-word-count="173"&gt;To an outsider, these cases may look like choosiness or defiance, but “ ‘picky eating’ undermines how severe this is,” said Sharp, the director at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. “We’re seeing kids with autism who only eat two foods. These kids develop rickets; they develop scurvy.” In extremely rare instances, the malnutrition can become fatal. Lucy Morrison, a mother in the U.K., told me about her son, Alfie, who had nonspeaking autism and restricted his eating for his entire life, primarily consuming baby crackers and porridge. In 2021, Alfie fell off a small bench at school and began limping, then grew increasingly lethargic. A week later, he had stopped eating anything, but the pediatrician told her, “He’s acting like that because of his autism.” A few days later, Alfie, 7, went into cardiac arrest and died. Only two years later was it determined that the malnutrition brought about by ARFID had caused his heart to stop. Lucy said the first person to tell her the diagnosis was the coroner tasked with investigating his death.&lt;/p&gt;

Grace ordered soup and a coffee, but her son, then 10, had already eaten his standard morning meal of glazed doughnuts from the Dunkin’ near their home; he says he can tell when a doughnut is made at other locations. The boy, who has been diagnosed with ARFID, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder, was polite and matter-of-fact. He described how he lives with an almost constant, vague stomach discomfort that makes it hard to tell when he’s hungry. It’s exacerbated by the appetite-suppressing effects of the Ritalin he takes for ADHD and the constipation from his diet of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizylh001o3b78orxfah3c@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;Until he was 3, Grace told me, her son ate everything from mashed vegetables to pea soup to sausages. But when he started day care, he refused to eat the provided lunches, holding out even as the teachers encouraged him with increasing desperation. Grace, who was working full time, started giving him packaged snacks on the drive home. Her son developed a strong affinity for them and began rejecting most other food — a behavior that worsened over time. Now, while the rest of the family has dinner, he eats his own meal of McDonald’s chicken nuggets and French fries with Sprite. At school, the smells in the lunchroom are sensory overload, so his safe foods are kept in the nurse’s office: gummy bears and sour gummy worms, Cheez-Its, Oreos, and Pirate’s Booty. He takes multivitamins to supplement nutrients. Grace has two degrees, one in psychology, and she knows how this sounds. Still, she said, what else can she do? Her son doesn’t have hunger cues, and without his preferred foods, he simply won’t eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizype001p3b78kl9oj7mc@published" data-word-count="223"&gt;ARFID’s emergence as a diagnosis coincided with a seismic shift in parenting culture. “We know so much more about the brain now than we did 30 to 40 years ago, and we’re raising our kids with a better understanding of how their brain develops, including their emotional-regulation skills and sensory processing,” said Kertesz-Briest, the clinical psychologist. Behaviors that past generations of parents might have viewed as “bad” and warranting punishment are today apprehended through a more compassionate lens. One woman I spoke with, who has a son with ARFID and generalized anxiety disorder, often thinks of the way her parents got her sister to eat when they were young. Her sister was picky, and their parents did “the same thing any parent in the ’80s did, which was to say, ‘Sit here and finish your food, and you can’t leave the table until you do.’” It would be a disaster with her son, she said. Studies show that parents’ forcing children to eat at mealtime can make them want to eat even less, and, for her son, “it would turn into a panic attack,” the mother said. “He would cry, he would vomit. It wouldn’t be about food anymore. It would be about torturing someone who isn’t trying to perpetrate a power struggle. He’s just refusing the food because he’s terrified of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizysl001q3b784lii0w44@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;When a child won’t eat, it’s a natural reflex to find something — anything — that might give them sustenance. Many parents dealing with ARFID learn to anticipate their child’s reactions before a meal, trying to solve for every outcome: What can I serve that my child won’t refuse? What if she eats nothing? Will it turn into a fight? Parents of children with a sensory aversion to food describe going to great lengths to remove, say, a brown spot from a French fry or to mix pancake batter in just the right ratio and pour it into the only acceptable shape, all to provide the consistency that might make their child want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizyzy001r3b789gl3yufr@published" data-word-count="154"&gt;But while applying pressure can be counterproductive, specialists say that accommodating a child’s preferences entirely can lead to more rigidity, too. When ARFID appears with anxiety, the cycle, Kertesz-Briest said, goes like this: “We experience the fear stimulus, we avoid it, we feel better. We face it again, we avoid it, we feel better. The more we avoid, the scarier something becomes. In the case of ARFID, even avoiding one bite of one food one time can be what knocks it off the safe-food list.” She continues, “For parents who have kids with anxiety disorders, sometimes unknowingly we collude with the anxiety or we collude with the ARFID. The parent thinks, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; know my kid will eat this one food, so I’m giving only this food to them,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I don’t want my kid to feel scared or uncomfortable, so I remove the discomfort right away.&lt;/em&gt; It’s a hard cycle to break out of.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizz4r001s3b784emuxshg@published" data-word-count="180"&gt;Parents don’t cause ARFID, but in their hypervigilance, their pursuit to help or protect their children, they can sometimes entrench it. “This is a very anxious parenting generation,” Zakreski, the clinical psychologist, told me. “You could make the argument that we are too attuned to our kids, that we are not really willing to challenge them in ways previous generations were.” (He’s not immune to this either, he admits — sometimes, he makes pasta three different ways for the same meal to appease his two children.) The modern food landscape doesn’t help. Restaurants, no matter the cuisine, attract parents with kids’ menus: a reliable list of mac ’n’ cheese, pizza, hot dogs, and chicken fingers. At the grocery store, entire shelves are dedicated to packaged snacks created specifically for children. “If you were somebody who had a tough time with milk and you were growing up in the ’80s, you were on your own,” said Zakreski. “Now, it’s like, ‘Do you want the oat milk? The almond milk?’” For some children, he said, more options increases the risk of ARFID.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzax001t3b785nfku3q3@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Meanwhile, doctors are increasingly aware of how other family dynamics — especially parents’ stress about their child not eating — can reinforce the disorder. During mealtimes, “the kids feel the parent’s anxiety, even if the parent is trying to contain it,” said Wendy Nash Moyal, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism, OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and learning disorders. “So the child with ARFID experiences whole-body tension — the feeling that their throat is going to close up more. The child’s anxiety and the parent’s anxiety, both things are going to exacerbate the ARFID symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizze8001u3b78jqbso40a@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Sharp of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta has also observed how a parent’s trepidation around their child’s eating can “spill over” onto that child. Two years ago, he saw a young patient with a severe food allergy. The boy had long restricted his diet, but after getting a stomach bug, he stopped eating his safe foods altogether. “The dad said, ‘I think I created this,’” Sharp recalled. Long before the stomach bug, his son had gone into anaphylaxis, and the father, terrified, became extremely vigilant about the foods his son ate. Now, he worried his vigilance might have contributed to his son’s anxiety. “And I said, ‘It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what to do, and this is scary.’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzhf001v3b78vnofpz13@published" data-word-count="145"&gt;At the restaurant, Grace acknowledged that she and her husband “do accommodate. We bend more than I guess a regular parent would.” Still, her pediatric endocrinologist is more concerned with her son’s growth than with his nutrition; blood tests show the boy has started puberty and, already short for his age, has grown only an inch in the past year — half of the minimum expected. “She’s panicking,” Grace said. For the better part of seven years, she has been taking her son from specialist to specialist without much improvement. She suspects there are people who blame her, but she also knows that while her son may not be eating a healthy, balanced diet, he’s not in a hospital, not on a feeding tube, and not relying on shakes for sustenance. “So if it’s just me feeding him lots of junk food, I don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;

She still wouldn’t swallow anything, including water, so nurses met with Mark and Laura and trained them in how to use the feeding-tube equipment. Amelia’s psychiatrist prescribed an antipsychotic medication that balances dopamine and serotonin in the brain, along with an anti-anxiety medication. Drugs are not always used with ARFID patients, but in some cases, they can address a separate issue, like severe anxiety, that may be adding to the patient’s restrictive eating. Laura is a former pharmacist who is “very anti-drug” — the idea of putting their already small and weak daughter on psychiatric medication with potential side effects was scary, but ultimately she and Mark decided it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzr6001y3b78ee21jtvq@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;Amelia was 40 pounds when she walked into school for the first time in a month. She was allowed to keep a small trash can next to her desk to spit in, and Mark would come in at lunchtime to give her food, fluids, and medication. At home, she continued the treatments she had begun in the hospital. With Kertesz-Briest, who is her psychologist, Amelia underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, a common treatment for other eating disorders that is currently one of the most promising interventions for ARFID. In CBT, a patient identifies their fears around eating, is exposed to different foods and tested on their negative predictions, and learns coping skills for periods of distress. She also attended regular feeding-therapy sessions, which, depending on the patient, can focus on the mechanics of chewing and swallowing or the sensory experience of eating — the way different foods smell or feel. In one session, Amelia cut pictures of food from magazines and organized them from easiest to swallow to most difficult to swallow, then made them into a game board.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzue001z3b78p6sss2ss@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Laura and Mark participated in the family- and feeding-therapy sessions too. They learned to serve small portions so as not to overwhelm her, to tell her she was safe when she struggled to eat rather than to pressure her, and to allow some distractions, including an iPad, which can be a helpful diversion for ARFID patients even if it goes against today’s no-screens mantra. They learned to adjust their language around eating, like coming up with a code word for dinner to alleviate some of the negative associations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzxk00203b78b1nmd6dc@published" data-word-count="97"&gt;Separately, Laura and Mark worked on their own reactivity to avoid the familiar spiral of Amelia refusing to eat, her parents getting frustrated, and everyone becoming upset. Laura had been devastated to learn that, several months earlier, Amelia hadn’t wanted to leave the hospital — she felt scared at home with all the yelling. Laura, for her part, had begun to feel as though she and Mark had lost their ability to communicate; she had been thinking about divorce. At Mark’s suggestion, they started couples counseling. For the first time, Laura took medication for her own anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj003000213b78abxdtz82@published" data-word-count="133"&gt;Most families turn to some combination of CBT and feeding therapy to help a child with ARFID, but because the diagnosis is relatively new, researchers are still exploring ways to treat it. In a recent trial for ARFID patients ages 5 to 9, Nancy Zucker, a clinical psychologist and director of the Duke Center for Eating Disorders, focused on acknowledging and repairing the trauma experienced by both the child &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the parent as a result of the child not eating in order to ease their anxiety around mealtimes. For one of the activities, she had them cook together but not with the aim of taking a bite. With each positive experience, the child was instructed to put a marble in a jar. “It’s like the kid’s giving the parent a sticker,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj006g00223b78erf75a65@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;Some weeks, Amelia showed improvement, taking the smallest sip of water. Then she would regress and refuse even that. In therapy, she was learning coping mechanisms, breathing exercises, and new vocabulary to articulate how she was feeling. But she wasn’t putting them into practice in a way that resulted in the ultimate goal of eating or drinking. Mark and Laura, increasingly desperate and exhausted, started to make plans to readmit Amelia into an inpatient facility, and in August, a spot opened up at a highly regarded eating-disorder clinic. By then, Amelia’s psychiatrist had recommended weaning her off her existing medications and putting her on an SSRI. After more weeks of no improvement, he gradually increased the dosage until it was double.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj009p00233b78sl5ivzcp@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Before they broke the news to Amelia that she would be going back to the hospital instead of to school, they decided to go on a hike with friends. It was hot, and the adults carried water bottles as they made their way up the trail. Amelia’s hydration still came from her feeding tube, taped to the small patch of skin below her nose. As they walked, Mark heard a small voice: “Dad, I’m thirsty.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00d200243b78ckf7gwnv@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;He looked around, checking that it hadn’t been one of their friends’ children. It was Amelia. “Oh, do you want some water?” he responded, trying to sound nonchalant. He handed her the bottle and watched in disbelief as she took one sip, then another, then another. The next day, they went to a noodle shop. Laura gave her a half-bowl. As Amelia slurped down her food, Mark and Laura squeezed each other’s hands beneath the table.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00g400253b78lqicf98z@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Doctors warned them not to get too excited. ARFID can follow young people into adulthood, and regressions are common. Something as simple as a change in packaging can cause a child with ARFID to suddenly distrust a food they’ve been eating. Parents worry about their kid catching a stomach bug or having strep throat, which may set them back. But it was hard for Mark and Laura not to give in to optimism. They called the hospital and canceled Amelia’s upcoming stay and contacted the school to let them know she would be starting third grade. One week later, after Amelia kept asking when she could remove the feeding tube, Mark took it out. When they looked at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, they both cried.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00j300263b7803rssnr5@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;In his view, the SSRI calmed Amelia’s anxiety to the point where she was finally able to use the skills she had been learning for months in therapy. Nearly two years later, she’s still taking the medication, but her doctor has lowered the dosage. Mark is determined to get her off it altogether; one side effect of the higher SSRI dose was that Amelia started wetting her bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00m500273b78fotdl409@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Amelia eats more now — pasta, fruits, and even beef, pork, and fish — but she still has anxiety. They have stopped the feeding therapy, wanting to let her go back to just being a kid. The family is still uncovering the full extent of what they’ve been through; last year, Amelia stiffened when the Kylie Minogue track “Padam Padam” came on — it was one of the songs on the radio during her months in treatment. The word &lt;em&gt;choking&lt;/em&gt; is banned from their household. Amelia is happy at a new camp this summer. She loves anime and playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and dancing to K-pop. But Mark hasn’t shaken the fear that this isn’t the end. “Even talking about this now,” he said hesitantly, “I don’t want to jinx it.”&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquitoes actually feed on nectar and plant juices, just like butterflies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that of the mosquitoes who do feed on blood, only females bite humans and other animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you get bitten or stung by any insect, it’s almost always a female,” said &lt;a href="https://entomology.umd.edu/st-leger-raymond-j.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Raymond J.

Factors like pregnancy, exercise and even whether you recently had an alcoholic drink play a much bigger role in whether a mosquito is attracted to you or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Mosquitoes won’t bite you through your clothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can bite through thin or tight-fitting clothing,” Haines said. “Scientific &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/12/7/636" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687d751de4b06691ec24b461" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/12/7/636" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that mosquitoes can penetrate lightweight fabrics, with bite resistance depending on fabric thickness, pore size, and weave density rather than simply the presence of clothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added loose-fitting, tightly woven fabrics, or clothing that has been treated with insecticide are more effective at reducing mosquito bite risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Mosquitoes only bite at night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;many mosquitoes are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;most &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;active at those times, several species are daytime biters that can cause &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;problems all day (and night) long,” Fredericks said. “Female mosquitoes feed on blood, which means they’re looking for meals whenever they prepare to reproduce.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian tiger mosquitoes, for example, are active during the day, while Aedes aegypti have biting peaks in the morning and late afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different mosquitoes are active at different times of day, although most are active at dusk and dawn,” DeVries said. “Also, your environment can influence your exposure risk. Shady areas can lead to bites from mosquitoes outside of the times they are normally active.

However, it is important to note that oftentimes the source can be introduced, leading to localized disease outbreaks as we often see in the U.S. with things like Zika and West Nile viruses.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: You’re safe from mosquitoes if you aren’t near swamps or wetlands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The myth that mosquitoes only breed in dirty water is dangerous since it gives people a false sense of security,” Fredericks said. “The truth is mosquitoes can breed in any &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pestworld.org/news-hub/pest-articles/6-tips-to-keep-your-home-safe-from-pests-during-storms/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="standing water" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687d751de4b06691ec24b461" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pestworld.org/news-hub/pest-articles/6-tips-to-keep-your-home-safe-from-pests-during-storms/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;standing water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, clean or dirty. All they need is half an inch of standing water to lay their eggs. That’s the size of a water bottle cap. Our team has found mosquito eggs in birdbaths, flowerpot saucers, children’s toys, old tires ― anything that can gather and collect water.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that a good way to prevent mosquito breeding grounds is to ensure standing water is removed, especially after rainstorms.

If you’re being bitten by mosquitoes after yard treatment, it’s likely from new arrivals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many sources of mosquitoes in an area, and just because an area was treated, does not mean that mosquitoes in a wide area will be eliminated,” Ashbrook said. “In optimal conditions, a mosquito larva can develop to adulthood in about a week. Additionally, some mosquitoes can travel long distances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of why insecticides alone cannot eliminate mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to use integrated pest management, which combines a variety of approaches, including proper identification of mosquitoes, monitoring mosquito populations, using different management techniques to achieve optimal mosquito management outcomes and reducing environmental impacts,” Ashbrook added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Bats and birds can significantly reduce mosquito populations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we should support our bats and birds by providing habitat, and they do consume lots of insects, mosquitoes are not the primary target and will not be significantly reduced by them,” Ashbrook said. “Bats are often consuming moth and beetle pests of agricultural concern. The little brown bat is the bat species primarily responsible for consuming mosquitoes, and their populations are in decline due to the pathogenic fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white nose fungus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that bats and birds are not effective replacements for mosquito control districts or pest management services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Cold winters kill all mosquitoes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

            If you needed another reason to get your daily steps in, science just handed you one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00023j6oy5rjmspn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new study shows that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/health/walking-full-body-exercise-wellness"&gt;walking daily&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of cognitive decline — especially among those with a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00033j6o56wbk3gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Almost 3,000 participants between the ages of 70 and 79 reported their daily walking habits over the course of 10 years, according to research that will be presented Tuesday at the annual &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/overview.asp" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association International Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Those who reported maintaining or increasing their walking habits over the years showed greater improvements in processing speed and executive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00043j6o8jzswg20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of walking were especially noticeable among those with a genetic predisposition for developing Alzheimer’s disease, according to the preprint, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00053j6oqnxkfta1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know sedentary behavior increases as you get older, and physical activity decreases,” said senior study author Dr. Cindy Barha, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Calgary in Alberta. “So we recommend reducing your sedentary behavior by introducing small bouts of walking in between those times you have to be sitting down.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00073j6oj0qrlo8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is a severe form of dementia thought to be caused by a buildup of harmful plaques in the brain that interfere with how the nerve cells communicate, eventually leading to their death, Barha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00083j6o19b74beb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As more nerve cells die, people with Alzheimer’s can develop progressive memory loss, confusion, personality changes and physical decline. Eventually, the disease can be fatal, and there is no known cure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00093j6oe2xvz34b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Genetics are thought to play a major role in the disease. Specifically, genotypes called APOE affect the metabolism of plaque and other fats throughout the bloodstream. One specific kind, APOE4, is known to make it harder for the brain to clear the plaques and is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji000a3j6oi5yu2y8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 15% to 25% of people have this version of the APOE gene, and the only way to find out is from a genetic test, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet#:~:text=APOE%20%CE%B54%20increases%20risk%20for,to%205%25%20carry%20two%20copies." target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdm8okjn000v3j6owd9vzwd1@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-mind-body-connection" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The mind-body connection
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Although the new study did not test a uniform walking regimen, Barha suggests walking multiple times daily to break up sedentary behavior and maintaining consistent walking habits year to year to prevent cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000d3j6o7y7cgthn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More research is really needed to determine how many steps that really takes, but more is definitely going to be better,” she said. “The next steps would be to actually try to figure out the minimum amount of walking for different subgroups, (such as) females versus males, APOE4 carriers versus non-carriers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000e3j6obiw601kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; found that even people who walked about 3,800 steps per day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000f3j6oapy6jy8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might be going on between the brain and the rest of the body? Experts have several theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000g3j6od0n57aq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, regular exercise has been shown to help the body produce more of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is like fertilizer for your brain, helping it grow more cells and form new connections, Barha explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000h3j6o9fam138e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re thinking there’s proteins released from the muscle that travel to the brain and, either across the blood-brain barrier or at the blood-brain barrier, start a reaction that eventually leads to increases in BDNF within the brain,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000i3j6o3mqudc22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another theory is that exercise reduces neuroinflammation, a common symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000j3j6ot4wu7eot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The brain sends immune cells called microglia to attack plaque buildup, but this can backfire, explained Dr. Christiane Wrann, an associate professor of medicine at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Chronic inflammation can lead microglia to begin attacking healthy brain cells as well, damaging the brain’s connections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000k3j6oig1ocd7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you exercise, you actually strengthen the gene expression program that microglia need to function properly,” Wrann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000m3j6og7pczdpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers were surprised to find that walking provided the greatest benefit to those with the APOE4 gene compared to those without it. To understand why this is, more research will be needed — but Barha has a theory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000n3j6ou7c2ehtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before the study started, we think APOE4 carriers had more room to grow in terms of cognition, since they may already have been experiencing some cognitive decline,” she said. “They also have more room to show improvement.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000o3j6o3ohj2zz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s possible that the study itself also motivated participants with APOE4 genes to walk more than they had been beforehand, slowing their rate of decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000p3j6ogfdj711b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a very strong example (that) it’s never too late to start exercising,” Wrann said. “Every step counts, and it’s much better to do an exercise regimen that you actually like, that you can actually stick to.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For two decades, Washington, D.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/olanrewaju-omolayo-falusi/2359516" target="_blank"&gt;Lanre Falusi&lt;/a&gt; has counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects, and timing. But this year, she said, the conversations have changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002d3b6nltjw1v2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time, I’m having parents of newborns ask me if their baby will still be able to get vaccines,” Falusi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002e3b6nhxgzdj6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Throughout the country, pediatricians say anxious parents are concerned about access to routine childhood immunizations, especially those with children on Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families and people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4 in 10 children in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002f3b6nzxtnuic0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really became an issue when RFK Jr. stepped into the role of HHS secretary,” said &lt;a href="https://palmettopediatric.com/downtown-office.php" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002g3b6nlkzbre0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concern accelerated after the shake-up of a key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory body&lt;/a&gt; in June, raising fears that millions of American families could soon have to pay out-of-pocket for shots now covered by their health insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002h3b6ny9cwgp35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the panel responsible for recommending which shots are included in the nation’s adult and childhood immunization schedules.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002i3b6nv24fxm96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy replaced the panelists with new members aligned with his views, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/" target="_blank"&gt;prompting alarm&lt;/a&gt; among medical professionals and public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002j3b6ni13kizyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People should be worried about what’s going to happen to the availability of vaccines for children,” said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002n3b6n2qhz7rz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;are required&lt;/a&gt; to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccines. States and other jurisdictions use the childhood vaccine schedule to set immunization requirements for schoolchildren. ACIP’s recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, a CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations to low-income and uninsured children. Half of children in the U.S. are eligible for the VFC program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002o3b6nur26x8sd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the new ACIP members withdraw support for a particular vaccine and the CDC director agrees, Tolbert said, the consequences would be immediate. “It would automatically affect what is covered and therefore which vaccines are available to children on Medicaid,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002p3b6necu9jqrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health insurance companies have not yet said how they would alter coverage, but Tolbert said such a move would open the door for private insurers to refuse to cover the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002q3b6ngymy1ga1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians worry about a future where parents might have to choose — pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket for shots or leave their kids unprotected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002r3b6neeu37hbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/" target="_blank"&gt;health insurance industry group AHIP&lt;/a&gt; said that health plans “continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002s3b6nunlid0fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians say news about President Donald Trump’s new budget law, which is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over the next decade, also prompted questions from parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002t3b6nivdzf180@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While parents may be worried about losing their Medicaid, the law doesn’t mention vaccines or change eligibility or benefits for children’s Medicaid, Tolbert said. But less federal funding means states will have to make decisions about who is covered and which services are offered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002u3b6ngtfjmwi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked for other spending, such as education or corrections; or, more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002v3b6ne7p3s8jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And they may do that by cutting eligibility for optional populations or by cutting services that are optional, or by reducing payments to providers in the form of provider rates,” Tolbert said. “It’s unclear how this will play out, and it will likely look different across all states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002w3b6n26yaf9tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, Kennedy announced in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC is no longer recommending the covid-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The move &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prompted a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician groups that seeks to freeze Kennedy’s directive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002x3b6n7q5c7k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In June, the new ACIP members appointed by Kennedy voted to recommend that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines with thimerosal, a preservative rarely used in some flu vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-is-thimerosal-what-the-research-says-about-the-vaccine-preservative-under-fire-by-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;rallied against thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; for decades, alleging links to autism despite no evidence of any association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002y3b6n5koy05t4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is no cause for concern,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement. “As Secretary Kennedy has stated, no one will be denied access to a licensed vaccine if they choose to receive one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002z3b6nrb50i5v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When the ACIP committee met last month, they reaffirmed that flu vaccines will remain accessible and covered, and they emphasized safety by ensuring these vaccines are mercury-free,” Hilliard wrote. “The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program continues to provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost for eligible children when the parent, provider, and patient decide vaccination is appropriate. Medicaid will continue to reimburse the administration fee.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00303b6nt5158eyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the possibility that a vaccine could be restricted or no longer covered by insurance is already changing how parents approach immunization. In Falusi’s practice, parents are scheduling appointments to coincide precisely with their child’s eligibility, sometimes making appointments the same week as their birthdays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00313b6nxuwdnsmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Melissa Mason&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has evaluated some patients who contracted measles during the multistate outbreak that started in neighboring Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00323b6npss52qdr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s concerned that any new limitations on access or reimbursement for childhood vaccines could lead to even more preventable illnesses and deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00333b6ntskcj6b8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nationally, there have been more than 1,300 measles cases since January, including three deaths, according to the CDC. “We’re seeing this outbreak because vaccination rates are too low and it allows measles to spread in the community,” Mason said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00343b6ng0svx4wa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children and teens account for 66% of national measles cases. Mason has begun offering the measles vaccine to infants as young as 6 months old, a full six months earlier than standard practice, though still within federal guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00353b6nv8bcsbi1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, overall kindergarten&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates fell&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. At the same time, the number of children with a school vaccination exemption continued to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00363b6nljubxu00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pertussis, or whooping cough — another disease that can be deadly to young children — is spreading. &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182774" target="_blank"&gt;As of July 5&lt;/a&gt;, more than 15,100 cases had been identified in U.S. residents this year, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00373b6nbf8ncohz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mason said pertussis is especially dangerous to babies too young to receive the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00383b6nw0xbvs1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For now, pediatricians are trying to maintain a sense of urgency without inciting panic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00393b6nrhuzytyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Columbia, South Carolina, Greenhouse used to offer families a flexible age range for routine vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003a3b6nsn3y5lbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not saying that anymore,” the pediatrician said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003b3b6n2v1zwybg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She now urges parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003c3b6neie8f6yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She described anxious parents asking whether the HPV vaccine, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/what-i-tell-every-patient-about-the-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;prevent cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, can be administered to children younger than the recommended age of 9.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003d3b6nz6esnh2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I actually had two parents today ask if their 7- or 8-year-olds could get the HPV shot,” Greenhouse said. “I had to tell them it’s not allowed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003e3b6nttavj3ru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the vaccine requiring multiple doses months apart, Greenhouse fears time may run out for families to get the series covered by insurance. If they have to pay out-of-pocket, she’s afraid some families may choose not to get the second dose. A second dose could cost &lt;a href="https://www.gardasil9.com/patient-a/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;about $300&lt;/a&gt; if no longer covered by insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003f3b6nmt8xu05o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I cannot be 100% sure what the future looks like for some of these vaccines,” Greenhouse said. “I can tell you it’s a very scary place to be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003g3b6ndc59iljn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s newly appointed vaccine advisory committee is expected to hold its next &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meeting&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August.

Physical activity lowers inflammation in the body. Evidence has shown that both aerobic and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training forms of exercise&lt;/a&gt; are important. But only 1 in 4 Americans meet the two activity guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;: aerobic exercise of 150 minutes per week of at least moderate physical activity, such as walking, bicycling on level ground, dancing or gardening, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; for at least &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/strength-and-resistance-training-exercise#:~:text=The%20American%20Heart%20Association%20recommends,protect%20your%20body%20from%20injury." target="_blank"&gt;two sessions&lt;/a&gt; per week, which typically translates to 60 minutes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCWIVNQFG5GBPLYBKMWS2NBPPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The protective benefit of exercise is seen with even relatively low levels of activity, such as around &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309" target="_blank"&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; (via sustained physical activity, not starting and stopping), and generally increases proportionately with more activity. It used to be thought that people who exercise only on the weekend — known as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/15/weekend-warriors-exercise-heart-health/" target="_blank"&gt;“weekend warriors”&lt;/a&gt; — put themselves in danger, but recent data shows the benefits of exercise &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.039225" target="_blank"&gt;can be derived&lt;/a&gt; from weekend-only workouts, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="476HUNGHJJDDFHWRH66P7JQR4M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="476HUNGHJJDDFHWRH66P7JQR4M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;2.

Two out of three people with obesity have this syndrome, which is defined as having three out of five features: high fasting blood glucose, high fasting triglycerides, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and central adiposity (waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men, 35 inches in women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPQOFUC3PFHVRPHICZJ5J6EUMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Metabolic syndrome is also present in a high proportion of people without obesity, about 50 million Americans. Prediabetes often overlaps with it. Prediabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1c (a measure of how much glucose is stuck to your red blood cells) between 5.7 and 6.4 percent, or a fasting glucose between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2GDROICPCZGQXN6YE3CSKRX3SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes carry an increased risk of heart disease and can be prevented — and countered — by weight loss, exercise and an optimal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AKK4Z26XZEDZAYB2Y45LCD4HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the glucagon-like peptide drug family moves to pills and less expense in the future, these medications may prove helpful for reducing risk in people with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes.

The optimal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower. But with aging, there is often an elevation of systolic blood pressure to about 130 mm Hg, related to stiffening of arteries. While common, it is still considered elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBS4Z3NB4RB7ZOEMFQOP6VF7UE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ideally, everyone should monitor their blood pressure with a home device to make sure they haven’t developed hypertension.

The term polygenic refers to hundreds of DNA variants in the genome that are linked to risk of heart disease. This is very different from a family history, because we’re a product of both our mother’s and father’s genomes, and the way the DNA variants come together in each of us can vary considerably for combinations of variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YLR4N7RSHZBSRNDZI2RFUHE4NY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That means you could have high or low risk for heart disease that is different from your familial pattern. People with a high polygenic risk score benefit the most from medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins. A polygenic risk score can be obtained from a number of commercial companies, though it isn’t typically covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N55MTVM6UNGAHJ5NHUBIC3OWK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I don’t recommend getting a calcium score of your coronary arteries via a computed tomography (CT) scan. This test is overused and often induces overwhelming anxiety in patients with a high calcium score but without symptoms or bona fide risk. If you have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, such as chest discomfort with exercise, then a CT angiogram may be helpful to map the coronary arteries. It is much more informative than a calcium score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;7.

While lifestyle improvements can help, significant elevation typically requires medications such as a statin; ezetimibe; bempedoic acid; or injectables such as evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent) or inclisiran (Leqvio). The higher the risk, the more aggressive LDL lowering may be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="34SN3RVQYVDJTG2MN6I7B2FTBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It should be noted that the use of potent statins, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, especially at high doses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00040-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;is linked&lt;/a&gt; to inducing glucose intolerance and risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Regularity means adhering to a routine schedule as much as possible, and its benefit may be due to our body’s preference for maintaining its circadian rhythm.

					&lt;p&gt;After entering your 40s, you begin to lose &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-moves-lean-muscle-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;—anywhere from &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/" target="_blank"&gt;3% to 8% per decade&lt;/a&gt;, in fact. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3661116/" target="_blank"&gt;Less muscle can lead to a slower metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you torch fewer calories during workouts and when resting, says &lt;b&gt;Ian Groves&lt;/b&gt;, certified personal trainer and managing director of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://trainingstation.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Training Station&lt;/a&gt;. This metabolic decline also makes it easier for stubborn fat to accumulate in your midsection—especially during and after menopause. While sarcopenia and hormonal changes are natural processes your body endures, you can combat their lasting effects with regular exercise and a healthy diet. So, we spoke with a trainer who breaks down six classic exercises that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/belly-exercises-burn-fat-faster-than-cardio-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;burn more belly fat than cardio&lt;/a&gt; after 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-habits-lower-belly-fat-women-over-50/" target="_blank"&gt;burn unwanted belly fat &lt;/a&gt;after 40, chances are, you’ve been cranking up your cardio routine in hopes of making progress. It’s a stubborn area of the body to work on and requires a solid game plan beyond cardio to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“While cardio can help burn calories, relying on it alone (without incorporating strength training) can backfire,” Groves stresses. “Too much cardio without resistance exercises can accelerate muscle loss, further slowing metabolism. That’s why combining cardio with strength training is essential for sustainable fat loss after 40.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength-based compound exercises are packed with benefits. They help maintain and build muscle, boost fat-burning hormones like growth hormone and testosterone, and promote the “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-harness-afterburn-effect-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;afterburn effect&lt;/a&gt;,” where your body keeps torching calories even after your workout is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a benefit you typically don’t get from steady-state cardio,” Groves says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;6 Classic Exercises That Burn More Belly Fat Than Cardio After 40&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;Incorporating these [exercises] into a well-structured strength training program can be significantly more effective than cardio alone—especially after 40,” Groves points out.&lt;/p&gt;

Recent small studies have provided evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2475306-drugs-like-ozempic-and-wegovy-could-significantly-cut-dementia-risk/#:~:text=Although%20the%20exact%20mechanism%20is,in%20the%20brain%2C%20says%20Reddin."&gt;GLP-1s may stave off dementia&lt;/a&gt; and Alzheimer’s disease, reduce &lt;a href="https://umcgresearch.org/w/diabetes-drug-ozempic-also-has-positive-effect-in-chronic-kidney-damage"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/how-do-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-affect-liver"&gt;liver problems&lt;/a&gt;, and may even be able to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811"&gt;treat alcohol and drug dependence&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other compulsive behaviors like &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/14/glp1-drugs-addiction-treatment-rehab-center-uses-weight-loss-drugs-to-reduce-cravings/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Fl7S0GEjfoKOAY89a_sDZYKQ3yJQEKMIGTSdpEu1XvNdJfES7d9t3Sehz3HXzigjyy0IXy-0YFCyIgZTlP_5TWXHajg&amp;amp;_hsmi=371103413&amp;amp;utm_content=371103413&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;sex, gambling and shopping addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With each additional study finding yet another application for these drugs, you might find yourself asking: Should &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; be taking Ozempic? Should &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; take it? Is there anything these drugs can’t do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And indeed, right now it can seem like everyone will be taking GLP-1, sooner or later. These drugs currently require regular injections and can cost more than $1,000 out of pocket, but cheaper and more easily used versions are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Eli Lilly will soon bring a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-lilly-glp-1-pill-trial-fda-approval/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Co.%2C%20the,3%20trial%2C%20the%20company%20said."&gt;pill version to the market&lt;/a&gt;, with a version expected to debut at a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/health/weight-loss-pill-eli-lilly.html#:~:text=How%20much%20will%20the%20drug,instead%20of%20going%20through%20insurance."&gt;lower price than injectable Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; or Wegovy did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/novo-nordisk-s-canadian-mistake"&gt;generic GLP-1 agonist&lt;/a&gt; is on track to arrive at Canadian pharmacies in 2026 and a US version will likely follow within the next decade. Some of the newer versions in development &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/21/well/new-weight-loss-drugs.html"&gt;may prove to be even more effective&lt;/a&gt; than the first generation, which will only create more demand among doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Put it all together, and we can expect many, many more people taking them. GLP-1 drug prescriptions for adults with &lt;a href="https://www.fairhealth.org/article/white-paper-on-obesity-and-glp-1-drugs-released-by-fair-health"&gt;commercial insurance increased&lt;/a&gt; by a staggering 364 percent from 2019 to 2024, but they were still only prescribed to 4 percent of insured US adults; more than 100 million US adults — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/glp-1-drugs-health-benefits-4014d7d5"&gt;40 percent of the population — are obese&lt;/a&gt;, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year, and as more insurers cover these drugs for weight loss, more patients will be able to access them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These drugs’ power comes from their mysterious ability to control people’s compulsions. Patients who take an GLP-1 agonist say that the fatty ultraprocessed foods they used to find irresistible are no longer so tempting, though sometimes those &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1e7rgru/return_of_the_cravings/"&gt;old cravings for unhealthy junk&lt;/a&gt; come rushing back after taking the drugs for a while. Substances as habit-forming as coffee no longer hold the same sway. Others notice decreased desires that have nothing to do with their diet — to bite their nails, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;We are entering the Ozempic era, and even as excitement grows about the possibilities for these medications, now is the time to take seriously the possible risks from this new class of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A lot of people experience brand-new cravings, sometimes for healthier foods. “Beans — I get cravings for beans. I never really ate them before, now I crave homemade baked beans in a tomato sauce,” Sarah, a charity development worker from Scotland who has been taking a GLP-1 compound for a few months, told me by email. “It used to bother me if a cafe served beans on a cooked breakfast; now beans is the main part of my breakfast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Swapping salad greens for carbs sound like a clear win — in fact, it sounds almost too good to be true. In the long term, what does it mean to modulate our desire? Are we sure we can suppress the harmful compulsion to eat too much without compromising the productive ones — such as the desire to succeed or the pleasure we find in personal relationships? How might these drugs impact our experience of joy and pain? What might that do to impact the messy human experience of…simply living?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“What are the very long-term effects of these drugs? The literature will say, ‘Well, there isn’t really bad long-term effects because some people have been taking it for diabetes for 10 years, and they don’t have bad effects,’” &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/berridge.html"&gt;Kent Berridge&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan, told me. “And I think that’s a fair argument. But then 10 years is not 20 years or 30 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We are entering the Ozempic era, and even as excitement grows about the possibilities for these medications, now is the time to take seriously the possible risks from this new class of drugs. In my conversations with some of the top experts on the science of cravings, they offered a cautious outlook in regard to messing with our brain’s desire pathways. But they were also optimistic that these drugs could deliver benefits to many Americans without turning us into emotionless robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-glp-1s-work-for-so-many-different-medical-conditions" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why GLP-1s work for so many different medical conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the 1980s, scientists had identified the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1 and its importance in regulating people’s digestion. By the end of the decade, investigators had confirmed that the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01931-z"&gt;encouraged insulin production&lt;/a&gt; — offering the potential to treat people with diabetes, who struggle to produce insulin that regulates their blood sugar. Then just a few years later, a scientist identified a peptide &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-literally-came-from-a-monster-and-its-not-alone"&gt;from the Gila monster&lt;/a&gt; that was similar to the human hormone GLP-1 but came in a more stable form, offering therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the mid-2000s, the first GLP-1 agonist drugs were approved for diabetes, but the daily injections required and the narrow focus kept the market small. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved Ozempic — a weekly injection, rather than a daily shot. &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/47/11/1873/156807/Efficacy-and-Safety-of-GLP-1-Medicines-for-Type-2"&gt;By that point&lt;/a&gt;, doctors had already begun to notice that some patients who took the GLP-1 agonists experienced a reduced appetite with resulting weight loss. Researchers began to study the weight-loss effects and they were stunned: One of the first studies found users &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183"&gt;lost 15 percent of their body weight&lt;/a&gt;, on average, in little more than a year, a wildly larger percentage than from any other weight loss drug or tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Ozempic &lt;a href="/culture/24001338/ozempic-bodies-barbie-botox-corporate-feminism"&gt;fervor&lt;/a&gt; had begun. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/compounded-and-counterfeit-semaglutide"&gt;Specialty pharmacies started to sell off-brand&lt;/a&gt; compounded versions of the drugs. The FDA then approved Wegovy, an Ozempic successor, for weight loss in 2021, and in 2023, Zepbound got the green light for weight-loss prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As their astonishing weight-loss effects became clear, research into GLP-1 agonists and their health benefits exploded. Today, the list of possible benefits is genuinely astounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But how, exactly, do they work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, a drug like Ozempic mimics the natural GLP-1 hormone in your gut, which slows down digestion in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Those who take it feel fuller earlier and longer, and it’s easier for them to eat less. The better regulation of blood sugar also prevents massive swings in glucose, which can induce hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a result of its effect on digestion, the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-ozempic-constipation#causes"&gt;most common clinical side effects reported with Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and its peers are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. In clinical trials for GLP-1 treatment for diabetes or obesity, between 4 and 12 percent of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9821052/"&gt;patients experienced constipation&lt;/a&gt;; a similar share of patients endured vomiting and diarrhea. There have been reports of other rare but serious physical side effects: The drugs have been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/05/glp-1-drugs-low-but-elevated-risk-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/"&gt;linked to an elevated risk of eye disease&lt;/a&gt; among older patients, for example. Some people who lose weight quickly &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ozempic/does-ozempic-cause-hair-loss?srsltid=AfmBOoo4EALBX7q2Bf4FtWyTzsEm-HGntr3whxiWCeHrbKESV-MC55tq"&gt;experience temporary hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, a symptom that a small number of patients on GLP-1 medications have anecdotally reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But scientists have also discovered these drugs can affect your brain directly, with sometimes surprising and unpredictable effects on people’s cravings — for food and for other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Naturally occurring GLP-1 secretes from in a person’s intestines into their blood and it disappears within a matter of minutes, destroyed by enzymes in the blood, Berridge said. As a result, it does not cross into people’s brains very easily. The drug form, GLP-1 agonists, on the other hand, &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;cross this barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When a person takes Ozempic or Wegovey or whichever GLP-1 they’ve been prescribed, the semaglutide endures for a long time, giving it more time to cross into the brain. Once the chemical is in that person’s brain, it can turbocharge neurons in your brainstem that naturally produce some very small amounts of GLP-1. Those neurons then release the hormone into many other parts of the brain and disrupt the release of dopamine, which produces that little surge of pleasure that makes eating a sweet sugary piece of cake so damn good or finishing a half marathon after months of training so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The drugs are getting into these structures and it turns out that they suppress cravings in all of these places, including the reward-system ones,” Berridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists began to make this connection when observational studies reported that people who took a GLP-1 agonist for its diabetes or weight-loss effects also reported &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827069"&gt;consuming less alcohol or fewer illicit drugs&lt;/a&gt; than they did before. Researchers started to probe further, experimenting with injecting microdoses of a semaglutide directly into the brains of animals in lab studies, and they have found a decrease in all kinds of cravings, including powerful compulsions for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X25001300"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923022002210"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These findings have introduced the startling possibility that, beyond food, we could control some of the most uncontrollable urges that people struggle with, often to the detriment of their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But they also bring us to the big question: If we can turn down the volume of our desire, how might that change the very emotions that make us human, the experience of our deepest joys and pleasures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-the-science-on-desire-can-tell-us-about-glp-1s" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What the science on desire can tell us about GLP-1s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ve started to think of the dilemma these drugs present this way: Can I cut off the part of my brain that compels me to reach for a bag of potato chips at night, without compromising the desire to sit down and read books with my children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unfortunately, we simply don’t know yet. Scientists aren’t exactly sure how these complex human desires interact. The desire to eat, for example, is one of our oldest evolutionary impulses, Berridge, the Michigan neuroscientist, told me. Can we really mess with that ancient part of our brain without unintended consequences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are at least two ways of thinking about what the answer might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, the (maybe) good news: Berridge’s research has focused on the distinction between &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; something and &lt;em&gt;liking&lt;/em&gt; it. He told me if Ozempic can eliminate our unchecked wanting of something that’s bad for us — such as fatty, processed foods or alcohol, for example — but still maintain our enjoyment of it, that would suggest people who take it are not suddenly at risk of losing &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of the pleasure in their lives, including other things that also cause a surge of dopamine in our brains, like finishing a creative writing project after months of work or cherishing conversations with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is a concept that my former colleague &lt;a href="/science/24086968/glp-1-ozempic-semaglutide-craving-desire-science-wanting-liking-opioids-alcohol"&gt;Brian Resnick explored&lt;/a&gt; last year: GLP-1s have the ability to manipulate a figurative “dial of desire” in our brains, which could be leveraged for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the 1980s, Berridge worked on a series of experiments with a colleague, Terry Robinson, in which they &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-21685-001"&gt;eliminated dopamine in rats&lt;/a&gt;. What they observed was the rats stopped voluntarily eating, drinking, and seeking other rewards set up by the investigators. However, when they were given something sweet to eat, their faces would react positively to the taste, just as they normally would. That reactivity, the researchers postured, was a proxy for their joy. The rats could also still become averse to new sensations, which again affirmed a capacity for strong emotions, even if their compulsiveness had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Berridge told me he actually doubted their findings at first — how could you like something but not want it? — but it continued to be replicated in experiments by other investigators over the years. In one particularly revealing experiment from 2005, participants were &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0735-7044.119.6.1619"&gt;given cocaine and a dopamine-blocking drug&lt;/a&gt;. They still liked the cocaine when they were given it, but their desire for additional cocaine was dampened when the dopamine was blocked. The study was small, but it affirmed Berridge and Robinson’s initial insight: Dopamine appears to influence the wanting of things, rather than the liking of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-ozempic-and-wegovy-might-change-your-favorite-food/"&gt;Early studies of Ozempic patients&lt;/a&gt; indicate most participants still enjoy their food despite their compulsion to eat being reduced. Some of them, including some of the patients I spoke with, also found themselves desiring healthier foods. “That’s encouraging,” Berridge told me. “I would say that’s a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, another way of understanding desire would raise more cause for concern. &lt;a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/jackie-andrade"&gt;Jackie Andrade&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor at the University of Plymouth, has worked with colleagues on the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25306214/#:~:text=Abstract,;%20Craving;%20Desire;%20Imagery."&gt;Elaborated Intrusion Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which proposes that all our cravings are not unique brain processes but part of our general motivation. According to this theory, when we encounter certain “triggers” — such as a physical sensation or some environmental cue — the trigger leads to a burst of spontaneous thoughts about an object of our desires. And when we begin mentally picturing our desire, our craving for it only increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here is the key finding, Andrade told me: The object of desire — whether it be alcohol, chocolate, or cigarettes — is less important than the underlying mental processes involved in craving. The brain mechanisms are the same regardless of the craving, based on their observations of people’s brain patterns when being presented with different triggers. We crave something because the image of it in our minds is briefly pleasurable and thinking about whatever it is boosts our mood, which in turn strengthens the craving and our awareness that we don’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This explains one of the conundrums about desire: Our desires are thoughts and thoughts require mental effort. So why aren’t they easier to shake? This cycle of environmental triggers — seeing a billboard advertising fast food or attending a cookout with chips and dip on display — leads to our imagining the craving, which leads to both pleasure if we satisfy it and frustration if we don’t, which is why we feel such strong impulses to resolve the cravings. But, at least according to the Plymouth researchers’ work, there is not a clear distinction between a craving for a piece of pizza and a craving for something more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“From our research, the cognitive processes are the same for both,” Andrade said. “Could we have less driven entrepreneurs or marathon runners because they’re on these drugs and they’re too chilled out to want to do anything? Right now, we don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-we-still-need-to-figure-out-about-these-drugs" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What we still need to figure out about these drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even as their usage explodes, the reality behind these drugs and how they affect our desires is still a mystery. Pills are likely to have the same effect as injections on cravings, Berridge told me, so long as the GLP-1 agonist is still crossing into people’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“In what sense is it reducing wanting? Because there’s a couple of possible ways. One way would be to subtract a degree of intensity from every want,” Berridge said. “So addictive wants go down, but then so do the everyday desires in life and even eagerness to go out into the world and face it and do things. That would be bad if it was a general subtraction in intensity of wanting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“On the other hand, it is possible that that’s not what it’s doing, but rather it’s lowering the ceiling,” he continued. “So really intense peaks of wanting can’t go so high, but things below that ceiling can still remain normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, GLP-1 agonists can only decrease the intense peaks of our cravings, which could allow us to, for example, not binge-eat or overdrink — without eliminating a more normal intensity of wanting for other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem is, Berridge said: “I don’t know of any actual studies that have asked this question.” He said he would like to see a study that measures people’s motivation to pursue a wide range of incentives, both mild and intense ones, when on and off one of these drugs. Researchers at the University of Plymouth are setting up studies that would evaluate behavioral changes in people who take the GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We need more evidence, because what we have right now is circumstantial and inconclusive anecdotes. Peruse the many Reddit communities devoted to these weight-loss drugs and you’ll see the subject of cravings come up a lot. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1kiygzq/food_cravings_are_back_even_when_i_am_not_hungry/"&gt;describe food cravings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1e7rgru/return_of_the_cravings/"&gt;come back&lt;/a&gt; after a few months of taking Ozempic or Wegovy. Others report strange new cravings they never experienced before, such as a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1f955gu/weird_craving_on_ozempic/"&gt;sudden taste for milk&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the changes are expected — decreased desire for nicotine or alcohol — but some are puzzling: One user, a true crime aficionado, described a reduced desire to look at dark or gory materials online &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/weird_elimination_of_cravingsurges/"&gt;after being on a GLP-1 agonist&lt;/a&gt;. Others responded by sharing that they were &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9v0yah/"&gt;less compelled to shop online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9vijrh/"&gt;stopped biting&lt;/a&gt; their nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Sarah, the charity development worker from Scotland, told me she started taking a GLP-1 drug three months ago after she gained weight during perimenopause and was struggling to lose it. She’s since lost 18 pounds. There have been some physical side effects — fatigue and acid reflux — and she’s noticed a significant shift in her cravings. Whereas she used to mix salads with pasta, she finds she no longer craves the carbs. Mashed potatoes used to be one of her favorite foods, but she hasn’t eaten that once since going on the medication. At the same time, she has new hankerings for beans and green apples — which she told me she found puzzling because she says she used to hate the sound of teeth crunching into an apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I don’t get the same emotions from food,” she told me over email. “It’s nice, I enjoy it, but I don’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; food in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;She, like many other patients, also says she no longer experiences the same desire to drink alcohol. She told me she drinks at most one night on the weekend and no longer attends happy hours with her colleagues like she used to, when she would have a few drinks midweek. “I don’t go and not drink, I just don’t go,” she told me. “Drunk people are tedious when you’re sober!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;GLP-1s are genuinely promising, but they also reveal our insatiable desire to find a wonder drug that takes care of all of our problems in one pill. Andrade said we should resist that temptation, even if Ozempic and its peers could play a role in helping to address important health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Research has consistently found that &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa050156#:~:text=At%20one%20year%2C%20subjects%20who,in%20lieu%20of%2C%20lifestyle%20modification."&gt;weight loss tends to be more sustainable&lt;/a&gt; when it includes behavioral changes in addition to pharmaceutical interventions. Ideally, you would do both: work on modifying your behavior, while medication assists. Losing weight isn’t just about eating less, but eating healthier and exercising more in order to enjoy the health benefits that those positive activities produce. If Ozempic affects all kinds of motivation, patients may not be as driven to adopt those other desirable behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If people are taking these drugs, are they more motivated to, say, become more physically active or to eat more healthily? Or are they less motivated because the drugs are doing it for them?” Andrade said. “There’s the risk that people might not want to make changes. If you’ve still got a bad diet and a sedentary lifestyle, you’re building up other problems that are maybe a little bit more hidden because the obesity is not there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is already an ongoing subject of concern: Some studies have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ozempic-rebound"&gt;people who stop taking Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; gain back much of the weight they lost; that may be because they are not adopting desirable new behaviors — better eating, more activity — alongside their taking the drug. On the flip side, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/glp-1-drugs-health-benefits-4014d7d5"&gt;some doctors say they also worry&lt;/a&gt; about people who take the drugs for reasons other than weight loss but end up undereating and increasing the related health risks of undernourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Are these findings a canary in the coal mine for other unexpected and undesirable side effects related to the drug’s effects on cravings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s a genuinely vexing question. After all, many people take these drugs because they do have a problematic compulsive behavior — they eat too much. Getting those cravings under control is the point of getting a prescription. But are people also losing other less obvious desires? Are they losing, in a sense, a part of themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The evidence for now is mixed. One Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9xo5uw/"&gt;joked&lt;/a&gt; they felt like they were getting mental health care they didn’t know they needed. Two Reddit users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9vlg0b/"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; that they had cut down from multiple cups of coffee in the morning to one (or less). “I’m kind of bummed about it,” one said. “I love my coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Same. I love coffee,” the other poster replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But Sarah in Scotland told me that while she is grateful to have a less emotional relationship with food, she’s aware of something else lurking below the surface. “I sort of miss the feeling I got from a big carb binge. It was sort of — anaesthetising maybe?” she said. “I’ve had some really powerful emotions recently and I wonder if they’re exacerbated (by) not being able to use food to push them down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOXzF3c1FXcUFLNFh4OFZEYUZzTW81ZmFCRGt3Wk1HQktrRkNDMHpMV3BQQlVZWDc2RkttMlNFbTFBaGc5azd5bUJqWWt6bWdaTnNEYnU4U2d1aDBVSnR6bEplaWFtakhBd081SVJvZjY2Z1oxeUUzT1NlM1JrZWJON1RjYVJnQQ</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情在加利福尼亚州今年夏天会有多糟糕？ -《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQLTBiN0VCX19JdzE3WWNaSVNtSnpBWTg1clcyWWVaZDVyYkdfMk1pcWt5R09xSmFVLVo0dkwzVWUzYTZUM01VU0FGZ3lrUW16TnBobERkekhzdEM4b2h1LWtTbHlTX1FyR3VGU1Z5THRjekExMTU0N0R0bW9Ha0FzMHdxQWJjLVB1d192SEJ1UDctanMwa3haUHFhNVl3dDhhLXJBSW5WOWZZdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is once again on the rise in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether this latest uptick foreshadows the sort of misery seen last year — when the state was walloped by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-05/californias-covid-surge-is-robust-and-long-lasting-surpassing-peak-from-summer-of-2022"&gt;its worst summertime surge&lt;/a&gt; since 2022 — or proves fleeting. But officials and experts say it’s nevertheless a reminder of the seasonal potency of the still-circulating virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely are seeing an uptick in the summer,” Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health and the state health officer, said during a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/FzZPYPRh7CE?si=LqeH9PciU6f4c-Nm&amp;amp;t=117" target="_blank"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has often been the case with COVID, the latest increase in infections is not playing out uniformly across the state. The uptick was first registered in Northern California and only started being seen in Southern California more recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she expects an uptick in cases in the Southland over the next two to three weeks, based on the level of coronavirus being detected in wastewater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My colleagues at Northern California Kaiser Permanente have already noticed this trend, so I suspect it will be coming to Los Angeles soon,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, COVID activity remains well below the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;level seen last summer&lt;/a&gt; at this point — and it’s too soon to say how bad this season will be. While last summer saw a particularly potent spike in infections, this past winter was the mildest of the COVID era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll know over the next couple of weeks which direction things are going,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains possible that COVID could end up being as active as last year, if not worse, according to Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UC San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a longer time since a lot of people got infected,” Chin-Hong said, noting California’s last busy COVID season was about a year ago, and immunity has waned since then. “And just like last year, there are new variants afoot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said he’s been hearing more people ask for advice about COVID recently. Doctors suggest taking common-sense steps to avoid getting sick, such as avoiding people who are ill, and getting up-to-date vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you had an easy case the last time doesn’t mean that you’ll have an easy case this time,” Chin-Hong said. “A lot of people I’ve talked to who’ve gotten COVID this year, it was a pretty vicious case that lasted a long time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the part of the country with the highest coronavirus wastewater activity level at the moment is the West. On the state level, the CDC says California has “moderate” coronavirus activity level in its sewage, as does Nevada, Texas, Mississippi, Kentucky and South Carolina. Florida has “high” activity and Louisiana, “very high” activity, federal data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral levels in wastewater have still been rising in many parts of the country, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possible silver lining is that Chin-Hong expects the rate of infected people who need hospitalization will continue to drop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of early July, the rate at which lab tests were coming back positive for coronavirus infection in California was 5.5%. That’s higher than at any point since last winter, but still relatively low, Pan said. On Thursday, the California Department of Public Health said viral levels in wastewater are 66% lower than they were at this time last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point last year, the COVID test positivity rate was 8.2%, and peaked at around 12% in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels are considered high in the sewershed of San Jose and Palo Alto, according to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing an increase in COVID transmission in some parts of the county over the past several weeks,” the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, coronavirus wastewater levels have also been rising — but remain lower than last summer’s surge, according to the local Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, the rate at which coronavirus tests are coming back positive is rising. For the week ending July 12, the most recent for which complete data are available, 6.4% of specimens tested by labs were positive, up from 4.8% the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in L.A. County wastewater have been roughly flat in recent weeks, and are lower than the levels seen the past few summers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the data suggest a slight increase in COVID-19 activity in L.A. County, but nothing yet consistent with a significant summer ‘surge,’” the local Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is much the same in Orange County, where the COVID test positivity rate is at 6.3% and increasing, but “still below recent years for this time of the year,” according to Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, deputy medical director of the Orange County Health Care Agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-related visits to the emergency room in Orange County remain stable, accounting for 1.1% of all ER visits, compared  with around 4% in August 2024, Zimmerman said. COVID-related admissions remain flat, comprising only 0.6% of hospitalized patients in the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That metric hasn’t exceeded 1% since the winter, and is down from the 1.8% recorded at this time last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health’s medium-term forecast predicts a minor summer COVID wave that is expected to peak in late August, Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State scientists do expect that California will see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave. They do not expect the state will see the one-two punch of seasonal surges that were typical during &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-31/l-a-county-ends-covid-19-emergency"&gt;the COVID emergency era&lt;/a&gt;, Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most dominant circulating subvariant now is NB.1.8.1, which has been dubbed “Nimbus.” But the fastest-growing strain nationwide is XFG, nicknamed after another type of cloud, “Stratus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are highly contagious, officials say — and Nimbus has been particularly associated with what patients describe as “razor blade throat,” feeling like their throats are studded with razor blades. However, current available vaccines are expected to cover these subvariants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Covid19Vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends that &lt;/a&gt;everyone age 6 months and up “should have access and the choice to receive currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines, with an emphasis on protecting higher-risk individuals, such as infants and toddlers, pregnant individuals and others with risks for serious disease,” Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s stronger than the latest federal guidance, which reflects recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-31/cdc-radically-changes-its-covid-vaccine-recommendations-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration dropped the recommendation that healthy children and healthy pregnant women be vaccinated for COVID-19. In formal documents, health officials offer “no guidance” as to whether pregnant women should get the vaccine, and ask that parents talk with a healthcare provider before getting the vaccine for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children,”  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;social media video&lt;/a&gt; announcing the changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has denigrated vaccines over the years, did not elaborate on the rationale for altering the recommendation for pregnant women in the 58-second video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pan said there were some contradictions in the latest federal guidance, given that the Trump administration was recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for people at serious risk of severe illness — a group that includes pregnant women — “but then it was stated the COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Public Health Assn., have &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32580/AAP-suing-HHS-over-vaccine-policy-because-we?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy in federal court, &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuit-vaccines-kennedy-95a1aa23c3f015f7a35a570f5ef8da36" target="_blank"&gt;alleging&lt;/a&gt; he violated federal law by changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, an estimated 37% of seniors have received at least one dose of the latest version of the COVID-19 vaccine, which was released in September. The rate is around 50% for much of the San Francisco Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior vaccine coverage is roughly 40% in San Diego, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Sacramento counties, and around 30% in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines is still in place,” Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of medical professional and scientific organizations are aligning to support scientific-based vaccine recommendations, Pan said, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Assn. and AHIP, an association of health insurance plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmed at the Trump administration’s changes around vaccine policy, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota has launched a “vaccine integrity project,” which aims “to make recommendations for how vaccine use can remain grounded in the best available science, free from external influence,” according to a university &lt;a class="link" href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California health officials are also warning that the proposed federal budget threatens to cut deep into public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government is proposing to halve the budget for the CDC, Pan said  this month, from $9.2 billion to $4.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80% of the CDC’s funding goes to state and local health agencies, Pan said. Nearly half of the budget for the California Department of Public Health comes from the federal government, and about two-thirds of the state’s public health department budget is given to local health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed federal budget would eliminate key centers and programs, such as the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, as well as grants for hospital preparedness and preventive health and health services, Pan said. The proposal also suggests reducing by more than half funding for public health emergency preparedness, from $735 million to $350 million, Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a COVID-19 immunization grant was not extended to California and expired, according to the state Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These federal funding cuts mean everyone in Los Angeles County will be at increased risk for transmitting and contracting infectious diseases,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it not only works to prevent and control infectious diseases, but also inspects more than 57,000 food facilities and restaurants, tests and issues alerts about beach water quality, looks over safety issues at healthcare facilities and responds to public health emergencies, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-10/six-months-after-the-palisades-and-eaton-fires"&gt;region’s recent wildfires&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The President’s proposed budget ... would continue a dismantling of core public health activities and severely reduce funding for federal public health grant programs, including a 55% cut to the CDC, our main source of federal grant funds,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.A. County could lose more than $200 million in annual public health funding under the budget proposal, the agency added, which would eliminate or significantly cut funding for public health emergency preparedness, chronic disease prevention, vaccination efforts and worker safety programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the concerns is the sudden termination of more than $45 million in previously awarded federal grant funds that support infectious disease control efforts and lab capacity, vaccination campaigns and substance use prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal court has temporarily paused the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back those federal funds, the county said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if we do not win this case, that funding will be abruptly terminated, leading to layoffs of dozens of contract employees, terminated purchase orders, and reductions in funding for [community-based organizations] supported by these funds,” the county said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQLTBiN0VCX19JdzE3WWNaSVNtSnpBWTg1clcyWWVaZDVyYkdfMk1pcWt5R09xSmFVLVo0dkwzVWUzYTZUM01VU0FGZ3lrUW16TnBobERkekhzdEM4b2h1LWtTbHlTX1FyR3VGU1Z5THRjekExMTU0N0R0bW9Ha0FzMHdxQWJjLVB1d192SEJ1UDctanMwa3haUHFhNVl3dDhhLXJBSW5WOWZZdw</guid></item><item><title>加州奶农获得2.3亿美元用于弥补禽流感损失--《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPbEhySFRBcVBIbzFLNEhTbGRsN2FtOEE1OVZNZWk2TE10TWF2WWV1d3pnakdIb1ZoMGQzYUJIUjg4eUVUaEVJc09XWm5OYzItbG9od29GWm1saTdvMzNrRUtwZWlnZFEyRVdLdHBKU3R0OHNBcGFSOXBnTGpqN3AxTEtNT3I3Zmh0SkZPLUI2Rm1WOEZnSjdFNnVHMXJFZ1lvNmZwOUphV0pGNVc4Y2NGc3VyZ1c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix max-w-170 mt-7.5 mb-10 mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;The federal government has paid California dairy farms more than $230 million to subsidize losses in milk production resulting from bird flu, records show, an amount that the dairy industry expects to climb higher as more claims for damages are processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 bird flu has swept through more than 75% of California’s 1,000 dairy farms since August 2024, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-13/cdc-study-h5n1-bird-flu-in-dairy-cows-more-widespread-than-thought"&gt;sickening cattle &lt;/a&gt;and leading to steep dropoffs in milk production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers were able to get relief under a U.S. Department of Agriculture program known as the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program, or ELAP. The program usually provides assistance for farmers impacted by wildfires, drought and flooding but was opened up for dairy farmers last year as bird flu began &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-11-26/bird-flu-warnings-are-going-unheeded-at-many-dairy-farms"&gt;ravaging their cows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture records show that 644 payments were made to 359 California dairy farms between November 2024 and June 2025 totaling $231 million. The average per farm payment was about $645,000, and ranged from $2,058 to the Pereira Dairy Farm, in Visalia, to $4.4 million to Channel Islands Dairy Farm, in Corcoran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those payments are expected to go much higher, however, as more claims are submitted and processed. Many of the payments issued in May and June were for outbreaks in 2024, suggesting there are more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relief payments were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by Farm Forward, a nonprofit group that advocates against factory farming. The group asserts that the subsidies help prop up industrial-scale dairy operations that perpetuate the spread of bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are mega industrial operations that are fueling an outbreak,” said Andrew deCoriolis, Farm Forward’s executive director. “Bird flu spreads in exactly the kinds of environments that we’re paying to preserve.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anja Raudabaugh, the chief executive of the industry’s largest state trade group, Western United Dairies, said the payments have “ensured our dairy communities and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-07-18/has-h5n1-bird-flu-truly-waned-or-has-info-been-stifled-under-rfk-jr"&gt;their workers&lt;/a&gt; stay employed and healthy. Until we get approval of a dairy cow vaccine, weathering this storm has only been possible with the assistance of the milk loss payments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Cockroft, managing partner of Channel Islands Dairy Farms, said while the payments helped with the roughly 30% drop in milk production his farm experienced, his losses exceed the $4 million he received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the virus caused cows to abort their pregnancies, and often prevented them from getting pregnant again. A dairy cow that doesn’t give birth doesn’t produce milk. In other cases, he said the udders were so scarred by the disease that the cows were unable to produce milk at levels prior to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a whole other version I’m not sure the public understands, which is the huge impact on reproduction,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted many animals died — especially when the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-10-22/how-did-h5n1-bird-flu-get-into-california-dairy-farms"&gt;outbreak first hit last fall&lt;/a&gt;, and the newness of it combined with the blazing heat of the Central Valley felled 10% to 15% of many California herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joey Airoso, a dairy farmer in Tipton, received a $1.45-million subsidy for an outbreak at his farm last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the outbreak has cost him more than $2 million “just on milk income and that does not include the over $250,000 of extra care costs” required to treat cows with medicines, extra staffing and veterinary consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it doesn’t cover the cost of the cows that died — which can’t produce milk or be sold for meat. The average dairy cow costs about $3,500, Cockroft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Van Rein, a spokesperson for California’s Department of Food and Agriculture, said the loss payments are “the most realistic way for producers to recover and to avoid huge disruptions in the food supply of these products.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but a former top USDA official who left the agency in January said it was important to provide dairy farmers relief once the agency identified H5N1 bird flu in a handful of Texas herds in March 2024. By then the disease had been spreading for weeks, if not months, making containment to one state impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we knew that we were going to need to support producers, and we knew that the quicker we could get some assistance out to them to help them test, the better off we were going to be, and the faster we’d be able to bring the infection under control,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farm Forward’s DeCoriolis and others, however, say these programs perpetuate an agricultural industry designed around containing hundreds, if not thousands, of genetically similar animals into confined lots — &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-04-14/nobody-saw-this-coming-california-dairies-scramble-to-guard-herds-against-bird-flu"&gt;veritable playgrounds for a novel virus. &lt;/a&gt; He also noted the federal relief programs don’t come with any strings attached, such as incentives for disease mitigation and/or biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Canada, said handing out subsidies to farms without trying to understand or investigate the practices they are using to quash the disease is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What are they doing on the farms to prevent reinfection?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA payments were based on a per cow milk production losses over a four-week period. According to Farm Forward’s data, several farms received more than one subsidy. While roughly half received just one payment, 100 farms received two payments, 58 received three, 19 received four and two received six separate payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one farm in Tulare County, four USDA payments were submitted once a month between November 2024 and February 2025. At another, payments stretched from December 2024 to May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said the multiple payments most likely stemmed depending on specific circumstances at the dairies involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cockroft of the Channel Islands Dairy said he and other farmers have seen waves of reinfection and milk tests that remain positive for months on end. He said he knew of a farm that was in quarantine for nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When herds are quarantined, animals are not allowed to be transferred on or off site. In California, a farm is under quarantine for 60 days after initial virus detection. It can’t move out of quarantine until tests show its milk is virus-free — for three weeks in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Rein, the state agriculture spokesperson, said the average time under quarantine is 103 days. He said that of the 1,000 herds in California, 940 are not under quarantine; 715 of those had previously been infected and released from quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarantined farm can still sell milk, however, even if the milk tests positive. Pasteurization has been shown to kill the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relief payments are another sign of how the U.S. government supports the agricultural industry, which is considered by some to be vital to the national interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve decided politically that this is an industry that we want to support, that was hit by something that obviously wasn’t their fault, and we’re going to help them, because it was a disastrous thing that hit the industry,” said Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. “If we thought about these payments as we’re using our tax money to help somebody who’s in need, because their family is poor, that’s not the case.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPbEhySFRBcVBIbzFLNEhTbGRsN2FtOEE1OVZNZWk2TE10TWF2WWV1d3pnakdIb1ZoMGQzYUJIUjg4eUVUaEVJc09XWm5OYzItbG9od29GWm1saTdvMzNrRUtwZWlnZFEyRVdLdHBKU3R0OHNBcGFSOXBnTGpqN3AxTEtNT3I3Zmh0SkZPLUI2Rm1WOEZnSjdFNnVHMXJFZ1lvNmZwOUphV0pGNVc4Y2NGc3VyZ1c</guid></item><item><title>今天的70岁老年人患痴呆症的可能性低于前几代人–这就是原因吗？ -英国赫芬顿邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in their seventies are less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/dementia/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688739ace4b0d2f59325db51" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/dementia/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; compared to someone of the same age decades ago, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834750?guestAccessKey=bacb167c-2948-4d8a-a4b4-4f6200aa35d6" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a study has found.

   &lt;p&gt;Back when &lt;a href="https://ph.ucsd.edu/phd/jdp/directory/faculty/boutelle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kerri Boutelle&lt;/a&gt;'s children were younger, she remembers watching how kids would eat ice cream cones. She noticed a big difference between some siblings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One child would eat half of the ice cream cone and put it down," says Boutelle, who's a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego. Another child would eat their cone extremely fast, grab the leftover cone from the first child, and eat that one, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, Boutelle has helped children with eating disorders and obesity. This informal experiment, she says, illustrates something Boutelle and other scientists are starting to realize: not all children respond to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some children are born with what scientists call a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4076308/" target="_blank"&gt;strong food reward drive&lt;/a&gt;, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/agearhar.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ashley Gearhardt&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan. They feel extra strong motivation to eat. They're hungry often, may eat quickly, and they don't easily feel full or satiated. Kids with a strong food reward drive can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;regulate their eating &lt;/a&gt;with whole or minimally processed foods, she says. But with ultra-processed food, they struggle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Popular advice around ultra-processed foods probably isn't going to work well when a kid has a strong food reward drive, Gearhardt adds. They need different help and guidance to feel good and stay healthy in our society, where these foods are ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A strong reward drive served people in times of famine, but it's a nightmare in an ultra-processed food environment," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Does your child have a strong food reward drive?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today children in the U.S. obtain nearly 70% of their calories — on average — from ultra-processed foods, which contain ingredients rarely found in your kitchen, such as preservatives, natural flavors and emulsifiers. Too many of these foods are tied to a whole &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/18/1238939706/ultra-processed-food-junk-food-disease-cancer-anxiety-depression-diet" target="_blank"&gt;host of health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904160/" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322004628" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5787353/" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;growing consensus&lt;/a&gt; among scientists that many ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;trigger people to overeat.&lt;/a&gt; "Ultra-processed foods are engineered for people to over-consume them," says psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/events/2022-events/faculties/eating-disorders/dr-agnes-ayton.pdf?sfvrsn=43588ce3_2" target="_blank"&gt;Agnes Ayton&lt;/a&gt; at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These foods derail two critical aspects of our eating behaviors, Ayton says. They can prompt people to start eating even when they're not hungry, and they can keep us eating even when we're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In our lab, we see that people are pretty good at understanding their hunger and satiety signals when they're eating real food," Gearhardt says. But once you start putting ultra-processed foods on their plates, she says, many people are really bad at eating what their body needs to maintain their weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And when you have a strong food reward drive, regulating eating around ultra-processed foods becomes even harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's go back to Kerri Boutelle's experiment with ice cream and look more closely at each child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first kid, who ate only half the cone, has a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; food reward drive. With kids like this, ultra-processed foods don't alter their behavior all that much, Boutelle says. They typically eat when they're hungry and listen to their satiety signals. "They just eat to get full, and then they move on," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The second child, who ate quickly and grabbed the leftovers, has a strong food reward drive. "They want to eat all the time, and it doesn't matter if they're full," Boutelle says. "Those kids are going to gain weight in today's environment" — unless parents help to protect them from the tricks of ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I always tell parents, 'the environment today tricks kids into overeating,' " she says. "What you can do as a parent is make your home as safe as it can be for your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How to help kids with a strong food reward drive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;   1. Don't keep a bunch of ultra-processed foods around and then try to regulate how much children eat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some families store ultra-processed foods in their home, such as boxes of crackers, granola bars, pretzels and cookies. Then they try to teach children how to eat only a small amount of them at a time, Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's really difficult for children," she says. "And it's setting them up for failure." In fact, that strategy is really difficult for many adults, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    2. Try to keep ultra-processed foods out of your home, but allow them elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A more effective strategy is not to buy these foods in the first place. And we know this is hard because the grocery stores are full of them. "But for some kids, it will really be beneficial," Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then you can help children learn to make healthy choices around ultra-processed foods when they're outside the home. Our society provides many opportunities to eat these foods, including parties, sporting events and even school, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/providers/katherine-e-schaumberg-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Katherine Schaumberg&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You don't want to forbid these foods entirely, she says. That strategy could backfire. "In our culture, food is connection. Having these foods in social settings can facilitate emotional health," she says. "That can outweigh the physical cost of them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    3. If you can't keep them all out, keep no more than three ultra-processed items in your house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;show that variety &lt;/a&gt;increases eating. So, Boutelle says, limit the options in your home to only a few ultra-processed foods. For example, keep one bag of pretzels and one package of granola bars in the pantry, and that's it. "If you have ice cream, have only one kind," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;     4. Bring ultra-processed foods into your home only on special occasions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help her two boys learn healthy eating habits, Ashley Gearhardt at the University of Michigan keeps her home basically free of ultra-processed foods. "We have minimally processed foods available to them anytime, except bedtime," she says. "If they're hungry, I tell them, 'Grab a banana, an apple, or some cashews. Go grab the minimally processed popcorn that we've got going on.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she buys ultra-processed foods infrequently and only for special events. "Like, 'Oh, we're having a bunch of friends over. Sure, we'll order a bunch of crappy pizza.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We do not forbid ultra-processed foods, but our baseline is foundationally real food."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This approach works even with her son who has a strong food reward drive, she says. Because he can regulate easily with real food, and he doesn't have to keep resisting the urge for one more cracker, one more pretzel or one more bite of ice cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to explain a scene from “The Lion King” to my mom. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Missing my mom when she went back to Ohio after a long visit with me and my baby in New York. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Describing to a friend how many New Yorkers volunteer to help me carry the baby’s stroller up and down the subway stairs, and how diverse the range of people who help me is, and how it makes me appreciate the no-nonsense communal spirit of this city, where people take care of each other without even breaking their stride.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Thinking about what an emotional movie “Inside Out” is — I wasn’t thinking about what actually happens in the movie, I was thinking about how the movie made me cry, and I cried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From these incidents, you might conclude, rightly, that children’s movies are my Achilles’ heel. What might be less obvious is that I’m crying more these days because I recently tapered off antidepressants after nearly 10 years. Escitalopram (the generic version of Lexapro) had long helped improve my mental health with minimal side effects — apart from &lt;a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-145671239?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stopping up my tear ducts&lt;/a&gt;. Now I’m in the process of discovering what my mind is like without the assistance of medication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My decision to go off escitalopram, under supervision from my doctor, happened to coincide with a surge in public scrutiny of antidepressants, fueled in part by the Make America Healthy Again movement. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration convened a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/25/ssri-drugs-fda-review-panel-antidepressants-pregnancy/"&gt;panel of experts&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the potential risks of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy. (A number of mental and reproductive health experts &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/fda-panel-promotes-misinformation-antidepressants-pregnancy-psychiatri-rcna220047" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the panel, saying that members known to oppose the use of antidepressants during pregnancy, or at all, shared misinformation. These experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/health/antidepressants-ssri-pregnancy-fda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the medications are safe.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his Senate confirmation hearing that he’s known people who have “a much worse time getting off SSRIs than people have getting off heroin,” and President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February instructing the MAHA Commission to investigate whether &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-ssri-antidepressants-children-doctors-risks-studies-rcna192722" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;antidepressants are being overprescribed&lt;/a&gt; to children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the effects of antidepressants, and the difficulty some people encounter in attempting to go off them, are also in the broader zeitgeist. The New York Times this spring &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/health/laura-delano-psychiatric-meds.html?searchResultPosition=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;profiled&lt;/a&gt; Laura Delano, who runs a nonprofit dedicated to helping people reduce or quit psychiatric medications, as an example of how “an online DIY subculture focused on quitting psychiatric medications has expanded and begun to mature into a service industry.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And researchers are working to better understand the withdrawal symptoms that some people encounter when they try to give up antidepressants, with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/antidepressant-withdrawal-new-jama-psychiatry-study-dispels-risk-of-quitting/"&gt;one recent systematic review&lt;/a&gt; suggesting they’re not as prevalent or severe as is often thought. (An important distinction: Some symptoms may be related to drug withdrawal, while others may indicate the recurrence of the anxiety or depression that people were taking medications to treat in the first place.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From my perspective — both as someone who’s taken antidepressants, and as a reporter at STAT — the conversation about the drugs demands nuance. The right medications can be life-changing, even life-saving, for people with mental health conditions, as the American Psychiatric Association and five other mental health groups noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/joint-statement-on-federal-concerns-about-psychotr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; after Trump’s executive order. It’s also true that some people may experience side effects that they decide outweigh the potential benefits, and that tapering off medication can be tricky. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are health professionals far better equipped to parse the research on these issues than I am. But I can say that in my own experience, taking antidepressants was the right decision — and while going off them wasn’t exactly easy, it’s also proved possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I started taking escitalopram when I was living in New York in my early 30s, feeling alone and unmoored, like George Clooney drifting away into space in “Gravity.” Clooney faces his fate with square-jawed resignation, but my despair and dread as I made scrambled eggs or squeezed onto a packed subway car was much less cinematic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’d worried that antidepressants might make me feel numb. But I could still feel the full range of human emotions just fine; as my therapist put it, medication just took the edge off. With the volume on my harsh inner voice turned down, I could focus on making changes. I moved out of an apartment I’d found on Craigslist, which I shared with two roommates who were already friends with each other when I moved in. They weren’t mean; it was just as if I wasn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I found a new apartment in a brownstone on a leafy block, a studio with an alcove and a bay window and a bathroom I shared with an artist from Estonia who filled it with plants and left a little welcome bundle of homemade gingerbread cookies in a plastic bag hanging from my doorknob. I went jogging with her, made new friends at a new job, felt my career taking shape. Relief: I existed after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d go back and take Lexapro again in a heartbeat. But while I’d never imagined staying on it forever, it turned out to be hard, once I’d been feeling better for a long time, to figure out how and when to try going off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I attempted it once, back in 2018, without proper supervision, mostly because I was abroad for a few months and hadn’t figured out a plan for getting the medication overseas. (Definitely do not do this.) I’d wake up every morning with a weight on my chest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in the states, I went right back on medication. I &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1771127/what-rescue-dogs-can-teach-us-about-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;got a dog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1777383/the-joy-of-giving-up-alcohol-for-dry-january" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;drank less&lt;/a&gt;, took an improv class, ate pie with friends straight from the box in the gold glow of the &lt;a href="https://www.diaart.org/visit/visit-our-locations-sites/walter-de-maria-the-lightning-field" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lightning Field&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico. But after about a year, as I started to think about going off of it again, the pandemic hit: Not an ideal time to start experimenting with what else your brain can handle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon I was also doing IVF, which meant I needed all the mental health help I could get. And when, at long last, I got pregnant, my doctors didn’t think it wise to go off medication during such a vulnerable time. (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that SSRIs are safe during pregnancy and that the risks of untreated depression are far greater for both parent and child.) The same logic applied to my first year postpartum, a period when so many women struggle with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;So it was only this spring that the timing to taper off medication finally seemed right — this time with a clear plan to lower the dose little by little and under my doctor’s watch. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had withdrawal symptoms for a few weeks; my brain was both slower to construct a sentence on the page and quicker with self-criticism. But the symptoms lifted. And here I am on the other side: a lot like myself on antidepressants, though maybe with sadness taking up a little more space on my emotional palette. And somehow even more of a softie, thanks to my newly unclogged tear ducts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how this story ends. I may go back on antidepressants at some point, whether because my mental health has dipped or because life has gotten hard again, which I’m sure it will. Perhaps we as a society should give up on the language around quarter-life and midlife crises, which implies we’re enjoying long periods of stability in between, and talk instead about life as one big series of crises and losses, hurts and upheavals, though with love and lightning fields and strangers helping you up the subway stairs mixed in, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, what I feel is gratitude to the medication that helped me through the last decade of my life. The truth is that I was never George Clooney, floating out into the dark without a tether. But it was antidepressants that let me see what I could reach out and grasp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this essay first appeared in Sarah Todd’s newsletter, “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://fororagainst.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For or Against&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

However, because fruit contains natural sugars such as fructose, some people worry that eating too much fruit might raise blood sugar levels and increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This concern is common, especially for those managing or trying to prevent diabetes. Understanding how fruit affects blood sugar and overall health is important. While fruit offers many benefits, moderation and choosing whole fruits over juices or dried options can help maintain balanced blood sugar levels and support diabetes prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the impact of fruit consumption on blood sugar and &lt;keyword id="27315060" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="type-2-diabetes-risk" source="keywords"&gt;type 2 diabetes risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body either becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t produce enough of it to effectively regulate blood sugar levels. This results in elevated glucose in the bloodstream, which over time can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney problems, and vision loss. Lifestyle factors, including diet play a critical role in both the development and management of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fruits naturally contain sugars, mainly fructose, many people worry that eating too much fruit could cause blood sugar spikes and increase the risk of diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research shows that consuming whole fruits in reasonable amounts is generally safe and even beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits provide important nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, which can help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. Consuming very large quantities of fruit especially in forms like fruit juices or dried fruits, where sugars are concentrated and fiber is reduced, may contribute to blood sugar spikes and excessive calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;keyword id="28031176" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="natural-sugars-in-fruit" source="keywords"&gt;Natural sugars in fruit&lt;/keyword&gt; vs. added sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to distinguish between natural sugars found in whole fruits and added sugars found in processed foods and sugary drinks. Natural sugars come packaged with fiber and nutrients that slow down sugar absorption, helping maintain stable blood sugar levels. In contrast, added sugars cause rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes risk over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing whole fruits over fruit juices or sugary snacks is the healthier option for blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of eating fruit for diabetes prevention and management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber&lt;/strong&gt; in fruit slows digestion and glucose absorption, helping keep blood sugar levels steady.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits contain &lt;strong&gt;antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt; that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, factors linked to diabetes development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole fruits are &lt;strong&gt;nutrient-dense&lt;/strong&gt; but low in calories, making them ideal for maintaining a healthy weight, a critical factor in diabetes prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some studies suggest certain fruits, like berries and apples, may improve &lt;strong&gt;how the body uses insulin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations for fruit consumption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for 2-3 servings of whole fruit per day, incorporating a variety of types and colours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid fruit juices and dried fruits that are high in concentrated sugars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair fruit with protein or healthy fats (like nuts or yogurt) to minimise blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor portion sizes, especially if you have existing blood sugar issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;When to be cautious&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes or prediabetes should work with healthcare providers or dietitians to tailor fruit intake according to their blood sugar responses. Some fruits have a higher glycemic index and may raise blood sugar more quickly. Monitoring blood glucose after eating different fruits can help identify which ones are best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/shifting-to-a-vegan-diet-can-help-in-managing-diabetes-and-weight-loss-study/articleshow/122763848.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Shifting to a vegan diet can help in managing diabetes and weight loss, study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 08:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgJBVV95cUxOa21lNFJxVnI2V0F6WldxRlZWaFFQYk5sSGVodm5uWmtVMl9jX2hOMHZ1WE5fTHFKZzRicW9PcUVWazkzMUxJVUJjYUZ4YjZ3Sl94RGVOODhPYUZVMDdQS0NObHhfZWlGczJlaFYyS0UxRVY3QmVRa2ZqRGNDZ3pnalo5d1hNRjY2U1l1M0ZvMUE1ZHpDWTNNamdabVlFakM5QnpvRkRVUUFFcHNQM3lya0tyTHQzZFZMUWFUN1Yxdi1rd2kyZ3NRaVFta1ZhZm84Szlvalo1ZlhOaURLaFBVZ05VdnFPT0ZiQnBWdEZROG5xWUc3Ym1DcFFCdXY1SWdLSlJhQ3ZMN2hYdGs2ZjhfNjZpNlY2YzN5SE5Xa29kVlBzbTZOaThlY2l1NnM4ODF4VWc</guid></item><item><title>8种最糟糕的炎症食物- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9Ja2dhNTByUXphMkpVdTlHN0FRS01IRWtUVEFGczh2d295VTg1bFBqSEtxZmxXalNralJSR1duaWRPdTdXUFhDVXE1OWo1OFhjeHVlYjZOUHN6cWxURGRjSFIxYTlFYWNCZzVqUll1c0xIbnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Christa Brown, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added sugar, sugary drinks and refined carbs may contribute to inflammation in the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats and ultra-processed foods are linked to increased inflammation risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol and certain artificial sweeteners may also promote inflammation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a hot topic—and for good reason. Research has linked cardiometabolic diseases—like heart disease and diabetes—with dementia-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The connecting link? Chronic inflammation. Other studies have also tied inflammation to autoimmune diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding how to knock down inflammation in the body, most advice seems to focus on the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:top anti-inflammatory foods to eat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;top anti-inflammatory foods to eat&lt;/a&gt;. However, increasing these foods is only one part of the equation. When it comes to reducing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chronic inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, it's just as important to reduce food components that may trigger and aggravate existing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some top inflammation-promoting foods—and how to limit them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Added Sugars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans' consumption of excess added sugars is considered a major contributor to inflammation, which in turn increases one's potential for chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. And it's become invasive. Added sugar can be snuck into foods you might not expect—like salad dressings, condiments and savory snack foods. What's even sneakier is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/284643/other-names-for-sugar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sugar can be listed under numerous names;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sugar can be listed under numerous names&lt;/a&gt;—like dextran, high-fructose corn syrup and maltose, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that added sugars are different from sugars naturally found in whole foods, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sugar-in-fruit-and-inflammation-8646343" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8046452/best-anti-inflammatory-dairy-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dairy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt;, which also contain vital nutrients for overall good health and tend to be anti-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; The American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams or 100 calories) per day for women and no more than 9 teaspoons (36 grams or 150 calories) for men. Tracking this can be easy since the Food and Drug Administration requires all food labels to include added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Processed Meats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most processed meats—like bacon, hot dogs, pepperoni, and deli slices—are cured with salt and synthetic nitrates and tend to be high in saturated fat. In the body, nitrates and nitrites can react with other compounds to form potentially harmful substances that may damage cells over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; The science isn't clear about exactly what the primary threat in processed meat stems from—nitrates, saturated fat or &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meats-and-cancer-11728821" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:processed meats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt; as a whole—so the best advice is to limit your overall consumption. When you do eat processed meats, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290503/are-cold-cuts-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:opt for "uncured" meats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;opt for "uncured" meats&lt;/a&gt;, which should mean that they were treated with only salt rather than cured with nitrates. Nitrate-free meats may use ingredients like celery juice, which is a natural source of nitrates. However, it's yet to be determined if these are better for you than meats processed with synthetic nitrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers want quick, convenient food options, and manufacturers have responded by offering more ready-to-eat meals and grab-and-go foods than ever. But this convenience comes at a price since chemicals and compounds not naturally found in food, like artificial colors, flavorings and preservatives, are often added to make these products shelf-stable or to improve taste and appearance. In addition, many &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292148/10-foods-you-should-avoid-according-to-registered-dietitians/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; are high in some combination of fat, sugar and sodium. Any of these can irritate the body, triggering inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy can still mean quick if you select &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15846/packaged-foods-you-can-feel-good-about-eating/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:minimally processed convenience products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;minimally processed convenience products&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, make the ingredient list the first thing you look at. Typically, the shorter the list, the better. Then, see if you recognize the ingredients. A trick to use when looking at the ingredients list is to ask, "If I were making this at home from a recipe, would most of these ingredients be in it?" If not, keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Refined Carbs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating white pasta, rice, bread and other carb-rich foods that are primarily composed of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" class="link rapid-noclick-resp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:refined flour;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;refined flour&lt;/a&gt; or grains elicits a quicker and often greater effect on blood sugar. And just as quickly as the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; rises, it can crash, leaving you feeling lethargic and anxious—and can be dangerous if you have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's more to it. Research suggests that individuals with a higher intake of refined carbs and low fiber were at higher risk of inflammation-related heart disease compared to those with a higher intake of fiber-rich carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have also found that low-fiber diets may throw off the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:balance of beneficial and bad bacteria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;balance of beneficial and bad bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in our guts, which can increase inflammation and influence numerous conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, allergies, asthma, and mood disorders, including depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose whole grains and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:100% whole-grain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;100% whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; products whenever possible, and don't forget that grains aren't the only place to get complex carbs. You can get them from beans, peas, sweet potatoes and other starchy vegetables that are also high in fiber and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Too Many Omega-6s (and Not Enough Omega-3s)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mono- and polyunsaturated fats are what most of us know as the "healthy" fats. These fats are made up of different proportions of fatty acids—two key ones are omega-6s and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that most Americans are overconsuming omega-6 fatty acids, largely due to the heavy use of vegetable oils like corn, soybean and sunflower in ultra-processed and convenience foods. And it seems that we are underconsuming omega-3 fatty acids, which are anti-inflammatory powerhouses. The overall effect is an imbalance that may contribute to low-grade systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; Limit ultra-processed foods that likely contain omega-6 fats, which can put you over the recommended amount. Instead, choose more whole foods and make a point to get in good sources of omega-3s each week by eating fatty fish like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8040993/is-salmon-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:salmon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, canned tuna or mackerel, as well as &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walnuts, flaxseeds and chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;walnuts, flaxseeds and chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth paying attention to the oils you use for cooking or adding to food. Most oils contain a mix of different fats, so the key is choosing ones that have more heart-healthy fats—especially omega-3s. Better options to use more often include avocado, walnut, flaxseed, peanut, corn and canola oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Trans Fats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trans fats are created by chemically altering the structure of unsaturated fats to give processed foods a longer shelf life. Unfortunately, trans fats are even more harmful to the body than the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15803/is-saturated-fat-truly-bad-for-your-heart/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:saturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; found in red meat, cheese and butter. This is largely due to the inflammatory reaction they create in the body that's linked to chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; Steer clear of trans fats by avoiding foods that have "hydrogenated" or "partially hydrogenated" oils listed in the ingredient list. The FDA banned the addition of hydrogenated oils to packaged foods in 2018 so you shouldn't find them in packaged foods anymore, but trans fats are also found naturally in some cooking oils used to make fried foods and fast foods. Aim to choose those foods less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's well-known that a glass of red wine contains compounds that can fend off inflammation and oxidative stress, which can help prevent cardiovascular diseases. One of these compounds, resveratrol, is a polyphenol that's credited with the anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that more is not better—and can be harmful. When you ingest too much alcohol, not only are the anti-inflammatory perks lost, research shows that alcohol then triggers further inflammation in the body. In fact, drinking more alcohol than average is associated with a higher risk of death from all causes. Excessive alcohol use also raises the risk of liver disease and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit:&lt;/strong&gt; Health and nutrition experts recommend no more than one standard drink per day for women and no more than two standard drinks per day for men. The &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8019266/drink-recommendations-for-low-alcohol-beverages/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:size of a standard drink;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;size of a standard drink&lt;/a&gt; varies, depending on the type of alcohol. Also, be aware of the calories in the cocktail you choose. Minimize calories and added sugars from alcohol by choosing a glass of wine, a light beer or a serving of liquor mixed with a low- or no-calorie mixer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Artificial sweeteners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; are deemed relatively safe by the FDA. Most of the non-nutritive sweeteners you see on restaurant tables and in food products are sweet-tasting synthetic chemical compounds like aspartame and saccharin. Some animal research suggests artificial sweeteners may affect the gut microbiome, potentially leading to inflammation. However, more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Limit: &lt;/strong&gt;Minimize the use of artificial sweeteners in general, and when you do need to use one, opt for a plant-based sweetener like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290579/is-stevia-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stevia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stevia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7967131/what-is-alluolse-is-it-healthy-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:allulose;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;allulose&lt;/a&gt;. The research surrounding stevia is primarily positive, suggesting that stevia may have antihyperglycemic effects—meaning, it doesn't appear to raise blood sugar. And a small study suggested that allulose is safe and does not increase blood glucose or C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use regular sugar or another sweetener like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-honey-8707139" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:honey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; or pure maple syrup, but less of it than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is linked with many diseases and health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, autoimmune diseases, depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease. This is why it's imperative to try to reduce the level of inflammation in your body. This can be done by including anti-inflammatory foods and limiting or avoiding foods that tend to cause or increase inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-inflammatory-foods-to-limit-11779534" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 07:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9Ja2dhNTByUXphMkpVdTlHN0FRS01IRWtUVEFGczh2d295VTg1bFBqSEtxZmxXalNralJSR1duaWRPdTdXUFhDVXE1OWo1OFhjeHVlYjZOUHN6cWxURGRjSFIxYTlFYWNCZzVqUll1c0xIbnM</guid></item><item><title>您是否有“高质量”的家庭？ -调度</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9yaF96bWVCV3p0aU5SZ1lYbnRYbUYwMWlEVlh1THlIU2dyT3ctczdvcEhwTFJXamU5cC1rZG9DN3lVUVU3d2UwY05mZXpxLW9CUnVGUlNoUkFPUUlZMi1PRGpvdEdUSXZQZF8wbTg3TllVdjkxRzRueUJ5UUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;
                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 2021. No human being has been born since 1995. The United Kingdom is ruled by a dictator, the elderly are being forcibly euthanized, and priests, in the absence of newborns, are baptizing kittens instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the premise of P.D. James’ 1992 novel &lt;em&gt;The Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;. James imagines a society that has seemingly become completely infertile, in which the government has fallen and where Xan Lyppiatt, the tyrant who styles himself “Warden of England,” has instituted a program of mandatory fertility testing. The clock is ticking: In a few years, there will be no humans of childbearing age left to reproduce; in a few decades, there will be no humans left at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this urgency, the Warden’s search for fertile men and women extends only to physically and mentally healthy individuals. This is a world, James tells us, that has become “increasingly intolerant of physical defects”: “no one who was in any way physically deformed, or physically or mentally unhealthy, was on the list of women from whom the new race would be bred.” This doesn’t apply only to people with fatal, incurable, or untreatable medical conditions; a young woman named Julian is exempt simply because two of her fingers are fused together. When Theo Faron, the novel’s protagonist, asks his cousin Xan why such exemptions exist in the first place, the Warden replies, “Why breed from the stupid, the feckless, the violent?” No, if the world is to be repopulated, it must be done with the best genetic material possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In real-life 2025, our society is dissimilar in degree, but not in kind, to the England of &lt;em&gt;The Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;. Across the West, fertility rates have significantly dropped, though this is likely caused by a &lt;a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/how-to-think-about-birthrates-a-multi-factored-approach"&gt;combination of socioeconomic factors&lt;/a&gt; rather than by an unknown medical condition as in James’ novel. Perhaps most disturbingly, some of us have adopted Xan Lyppiatt’s attitude towards procreation: We &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;want to have kids, but only optimal children are desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/01/opinion/ivf-gene-selection-fertility.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; by Anna Louie Sussman profiling Noor Siddiqui, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/"&gt;Orchid&lt;/a&gt;, a company using gene technology to screen embryos for a plethora of conditions, from rare heart diseases to schizophrenia. Siddiqui’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1907178921315250630?t=NjnlpoqRriklORE9XOencQ&amp;amp;s=03"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; about the article went viral—it has over 6 million views to date—and generated a heated debate online about the moral legitimacy of parents carefully selecting the healthiest embryo to use in an IVF pregnancy. Siddiqui’s X thread makes it clear that she’s aware of people’s concerns that she’s “playing God.” She simply doesn’t see a problem with playing God in the first place. Yet, as Sussman puts it in her article, “By giving parents the illusion of so much control, these technologies could lead to viewing embryos as a consumer product while overemphasizing the role of genetics in life outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This desire to “optimize” human life reeks of eugenics, yet many fiercely defend it as morally responsible. &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/find-an-expert/professor-julian-savulescu"&gt;Julian Savulescu&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the University of Oxford, has advocated for “procreative beneficence”—that is, the idea that potential parents using IVF have a moral duty to choose to implant the embryos that are most likely to have the greatest quality of life. Siddiqui’s justification of her company on X follows similar lines: If you want to have children, you should ensure that you’re not passing down any of your health conditions. Everyone’s baby, Siddiqui writes, now “gets to win the genetic lottery” (everyone, at least, who can afford Orchid’s services). And there’s a moving human story to go with this idea: Siddiqui’s mother went blind while Siddiqui was still in elementary school due to an undiagnosed condition. Siddiqui “got lucky” and didn’t inherit the disease. Now, she’s screening her own embryos to make sure that her own children don’t go blind. She calls this “preventing suffering,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1907178921315250630?t=NjnlpoqRriklORE9XOencQ&amp;amp;s=03"&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt;: “If you could prevent your child from going blind—would you?” But the belief that one &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;is taken as a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality that embryo testing isn’t actually preventing illness, but simply allowing adults to destroy their own “faulty” embryos, seems to escape Siddiqui’s notice. And the fact that if her own genetically suboptimal mother hadn’t chosen to have a child Siddiqui herself wouldn’t exist is entirely ignored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues around children are often cloaked in the veneer of choice—supporters of access to abortion, of course, have long adopted the label “pro-choice.” You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;have a healthy child, or you &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;have an unhealthy one, or you can have no child at all. You’re the adult. You’re in charge. But choice is often an illusion. On Orchid’s homepage, you’re greeted with a moral imperative: “Have healthy babies.” What is really meant here is closer to “Have genetically optimal babies.” For the last several decades, people have been feeling the pressure to do just that. In my country, the U.K., up to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51658631"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. Notoriously, in Iceland the figure has steadily been closer to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37500189"&gt;100 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But conditions like Down syndrome are not hereditary. On the other hand, adults suffering from hereditary conditions might experience judgment if they wish to become parents. Data around how many adults dealing with mental or physical illness choose to have a family is not as readily available, but major outlets routinely run pieces about the childfree by choice movement. An &lt;em&gt;Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/12/staying-child-free-for-mental-health-reasons/622667/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from 2016, for instance, collected the stories of mentally ill individuals who remained without children—not only to protect their own mental health, but out of a concern about the potential child’s quality of life. Many reported that the desire to have children was ultimately outweighed by the fear that illnesses like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia would be too great a burden for the potential child to bear. A bipolar woman, Liz, mentioned that she would need a much stronger network of support to consider raising a child who would have to grow up with a bipolar mother and with the potential to develop the same disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding who should be encouraged to reproduce is a task riddled with ethical conundrums. A person struggling with schizophrenia may feel morally compelled to abstain from having children. What about someone with Type 1 diabetes? Or real-life counterparts of P.D. James’ Julian, people born with non-life-threatening deformities? When we start prizing optimal health above all else, where do we draw the line? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I have nothing but sympathy for those who are hesitant to expose their children to hardships, I would also urge them—and all those of us who count as “healthy”—to remember that life &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;hardship. While advancements in medicine and technology allow us to live longer, more comfortable lives, we are a long way away from achieving painlessness, and even longer from being able to predict when suffering will strike. Many parents, mothers especially, begin to struggle with their mental health only &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;having children, for a variety of reasons including postpartum psychosis, birth PTSD, and depression. Such conditions can’t be always prevented, and yet those children will inevitably be affected, to varying degrees, by their mother’s psychological issues. More generally, people get cancer. People die in car accidents. Life is unpredictable and paved with suffering; we are deluding ourselves if we believe we can ever have complete control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, one may argue, when it comes to childbearing and childrearing we should try to do everything in our power to prevent pain, even if we can’t entirely eradicate it. On the one hand, we may be concerned about preventing further suffering for the adults involved, as it’s undeniable that embarking on parenthood with preexisting health concerns comes with a unique set of challenges. On the other hand, we may also worry that children born to mentally or physically unwell parents will have harder lives from the outset—in addition to the risk of being born with or developing the same infirmities as those unwell parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which I respond: What if we are paying for the absence of pain with the absence of joy? What if, by shielding ourselves from suffering, we are closing ourselves off from becoming more hard-working, compassionate, resilient people? We’re refusing to accept the shared responsibility of the care of the sick, the distressed, the vulnerable, both parents and children alike. By doing so, we’re also unintentionally precluding the possibility of strengthening our social bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When preparing to write this essay, I spoke to several women in my local community as well as abroad who are raising children while battling physical and mental disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One woman, a 35-year-old European immigrant to the U.K., has been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, with which she has struggled for years. This was aggravated by undiagnosed postpartum depression after her first child was born (the child is now 5 years old). In 2021, she contracted an autoimmune lung condition, spent two weeks in the hospital, and almost died of pneumonia. Friends, concerned for her wellbeing, told her not to have any more children. A relative openly judged her for trying to get pregnant again. She has since had a second child, one year ago, and she tells me she’d love to have a third. She knows that her issues will inevitably affect her children, but she also believes that what kids need most is to know that they are wanted and loved, and she can provide that: “I’m a good mum. My kids are happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.juliemachado.pt/"&gt;Julie Machado&lt;/a&gt; is a 39-year-old mother of six, originally from California and now living in Lisbon, Portugal. She always wanted a big family. Everything seemed to be going well until the delivery of her sixth child, during which she suffered an epidural injury. She underwent surgery, but remained in a wheelchair for eight months. Three years on, she can now walk, and her muscle strength is improving, but she still suffers from constant neuropathic pain and still takes opioids—albeit at lower doses—to manage it. In February of this year, Julie discovered she was pregnant with her seventh child. She was initially scared, but seeing her children’s joy at the news of a new sibling, as well as hearing her friends’ promises of help when the baby comes, has helped to assuage her fears. Still, after announcing her seventh pregnancy, she’s dealt with “patronizing” doctors and has received “insulting” criticism from her own sister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories these women have told me serve as a reminder that we’re very happy to encourage people to have more children—as long as the children in question are born in optimal circumstances, and as long as we don’t have to help raise them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like these are also found all over the internet. Lizzie Reezay, a popular Christian content creator on YouTube, has made a number of videos over the years on her struggles with bipolar disorder. She used to be decidedly against having her own biological children for fear of passing down the disorder. In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSw4Zz5jsa8"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; about why she later changed her mind, she explains that her own negative experience with her disorder was largely due to the fact that it went undiagnosed until later in her life. “I’ll be the absolute perfect mom in helping them process that, and work through it and heal,” she says about the possibility of her future children struggling with the disorder. “I’ll know every single emotion that they’re feeling and going through.” Lizzie had her first child in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, novelist Victor LaValle wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/09/dont-have-children-mental-health-lavalle"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;about his decision to have a child despite the crippling fear that he would pass down either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, both of which ran in his family. After years of agonizing over the decision, his wife Emily got pregnant. “I realise I might pass down an incurable illness to my son,” LaValle wrote, “but living based on what might go wrong seems like less and less of a life as I get older. The one thing I can try to control is whether I teach my child to be ruled by anxiety, by fear.” LaValle’s openness to life is admirable. And yet, there’s something incredibly striking about one of his additional remarks: “The thing I worry about can’t yet be discovered in any test available to medical science.” That statement is already outdated just over a decade later: Orchid now &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;screen for schizophrenia risk. It’s impossible not to wonder what LaValle would have done if this technology had then been available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2019, then-college student Julian Assele wrote an &lt;a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/04/25/assele-abortion-isnt-mercy/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the platitude that abortion is a mercy for unwanted children. He recounts the horrific stories of his fellow foster kids, yet claims that “aborting children is [not] an act of mercy. … It is society’s justification for the erasure of the most vulnerable.” Assele believes that each person’s life is valuable because “each of them has an innate worth. Life is a gift in and of itself, regardless of the circumstances.” His perspective is in stark contrast to public intellectuals like psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, who, despite claiming to be pro-family, warned lawmakers in a 2022 &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-human-cost-of-restricting-abortion-mental-health-depression-anxiety-neglect-dobbs-substance-abuse-unwanted-pregnancy-11659018533"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that restricting abortion access might result in unwanted children “prone to depression, anxiety, addiction and other social and emotional disorders,” especially if the mother in question was “young and immature.” A sinister message is echoing: A life that begins with a higher probability of certain types of pain is not worth living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all these theoretical discussions about who should be encouraged to reproduce, we are ignoring the real stories of men and women bravely raising families in adverse circumstances. We’re ignoring the unpredictability of life, and we’re blinding ourselves to the incomparable joy that children bring. When I asked the 35-year-old woman what she would say to people considering having children despite health concerns, she told me that “parents are never perfect” and trauma inevitably gets passed down to children. But, she also said, “every new life is a chance … for redemption. … We are not put here to be happy and comfortable all the time … but to try to be good, to try to be better.” She is confident that focusing on nurturing a child can do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a full-fledged philosophical war taking place in our society. For every Julian Assele, who sees life as inherently precious, there is a selective pronatalist like Komisar, Savulescu, Siddiqui. We are encouraging vulnerable people to deny themselves the joy and responsibility of having a family because figuring out how to help them collectively as a society is harder than just telling them to remain childless. With the right medication, resources, and support at hand, many people whom these selective pronatalists would deem unfit for reproduction—the poor, the young, the disabled, the broken, the despairing—might make excellent parents. Many of them already are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are asking the question of whether individual people, as self-contained, autonomous units, are fit enough to reproduce. That’s the wrong question. We should ask instead: Do we believe that to exist is in itself a good thing? If we don’t, then we’re not much different from the society of P.D. James’ dystopian imagination. If we do, we must be prepared to share the joys as well as the burdens of existence with the vulnerable and the imperfect—that is, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

But it wasn't designed for sitting still,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is designed to move. It doesn't matter how ergonomic your office chair is, the height of your screen or even having a standing desk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not the answer to keeping your spine healthy. Movement is.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst he acknowledged that these alterations may help improve posture, the best thing to do is take regular breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I set a chime on my [computer] desktop every hour signalling that it is time to get up and move,' he suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the back expert, movement is absolutely crucial to spine health, as this exercises the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Natalia sedentary lifestyles spent looking at screens will cause havoc for your back as you age &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tissue loading, which occurs when the muscles contract, is optimal for skeletal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this followed up by a period of rest—for example returning to your desk—the tissue becomes more resistant, building up back strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said this is particularly crucial for under 35-year-olds, who are still building bone mass, making it a critical time to implement practices that promote bone density and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peak bone mass, which typically occurs between 25 and 35-years-old is the highest amount of bone tissue an individual can attain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Failure to build strong bones during this phase of life can increase the risk of osteoporosis—a health condition that weakens bones—and fractures in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's all about forming habits when you're young,' Dr Natalia warned. 'If you don't use it, you'll lose it.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, it's not too late for people who have surpassed the building block years, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My main message to everyone is to stay active, don't be afraid and push through the pain.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whilst he said building bone density and strength is crucial for young people it is never too late to incorporate movement into your daily routine to protect your spine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst this might seem counter-intuitive, Dr Natalia said the best thing for people who have experienced back pain is to stay active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People become really inactive when they are suffering from back pain, partly because they are scared of it becoming something more serious and partly because they have been told that rest is the best thing for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This couldn't be further from the truth,' he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst he acknowledged that some pain is more severe than others, he said it is a common misconception that when something hurts it is causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People too often confuse hurt and harm', he explained. 'Whilst pushing through may be painful, it is often the best thing you can do for your spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Remember modification is always better than stopping altogether.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who are more prone to back pain, Dr Natalia suggested swapping out high impact workouts like running for something more gentle, like pilates or swimming when the pain is worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Norwegian and Danish researchers have recently revealed that being on your feet for over an hour-and-a-half every day could slash the risk of chronic lower back pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However if the pain is persistent and does not improve after six weeks of rest, taking over-the-counter painkillers such as Ibuprofen and physical therapy, this could be a red-flag warning sign of something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, Dr Natalia advises contacting your GP who may refer you to a specialist for MRI imaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said that 90 per cent of cases do no progress to this stage and that most people should get better with a combination of physical therapy and painkillers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best piece of advice I can give is don't be scared of your back and stay active.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as exercising regularly, making sure to stand up every hour, Dr Natalia said he also focuses on his diet, taking probiotics every day—which promote healthy bacteria in the gut—avoiding processed foods and refined sugar and eating a largely anti-inflammatory diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeons top tips come as new research has suggested that only one in ten treatments for back pain actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-south-wales/index.html" id="mol-204ffd90-67da-11f0-a800-1fad4830ed3e" class=""&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; found that just one treatment for acute lower back pain and five treatments for chronic—or long-term—back pain were 'efficacious'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, for short-term back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For long-term back pain, the treatments found to be effective were exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants and drugs that target the pain receptors transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings will come as a blow to the millions of Americans and Brits who suffer from back pain, which can often be debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the most common form of pain experienced by adults, with lower back pain affecting six in ten people in the UK, and eight in ten in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there is usually no immediately identifiable cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if entry-level jobs haven’t vanished? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if we’re just not equipping young people with the skills those roles now call for? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, we told a generation that their future would be secured if they just mastered coding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We restructured high schools around tech labs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/the-bard-and-the-boardroom-why-todays-best-leaders-read-more-than-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diminished humanities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; departments. Smirked at philosophy degrees. We insisted that fluency in logic, math, and engineering would lead to stable, well-compensated careers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But now, artificial intelligence is doing the coding. And the jobs we built our education systems around? They’re the first being automated away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tough truth: we spent years preparing students to behave like machines, just as machines learned to do their jobs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue isn’t that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/07/talent-development-in-the-future-of-work-starts-with-a-career-climbing-wall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first step on the career ladder is gone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s that it shifted, and we’re still looking for it in the old place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Change We Didn’t Anticipate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The early-career jobs that once served as stepping stones into roles like analyst, marketer, developer, or support staff are no longer the go-to entry. Employers are now leaning on AI to complete those tasks more efficiently and at lower cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The people still succeeding? They aren’t necessarily those with the newest diplomas or technical badges. They’re the ones with insight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/working-smarter-with-ai-why-critical-thinking-is-still-your-superpower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judgment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Human nuance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/04/01/february-2025-jolts-report-scared-of-our-own-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;JOLTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; numbers, U.S. hiring has dropped to a level not seen in over seven years. And the hit to early-career roles is even steeper — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/macro/white-collar-workers-are-getting-the-blues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revelio Labs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that white-collar entry-level postings dropped 12.7% in the past year. Jobs like software development and business analysis saw declines near 25%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this downturn is gaining speed. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2025/05/31/ceos-jensen-huang-and-dario-amodei-on-ai-adapt-or-be-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;cautioned &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that we’re “sleepwalking into mass unemployment,” warning that half of today’s entry-level knowledge jobs could be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/anthropic-ceo-warns-ai-will-swiftly-decimate-entry-level-white-collar-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;gone in five years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These aren’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/u-s-secretary-of-commerce-says-factory-jobs-for-life-is-the-future-of-work-for-you-your-kids-and-your-grandkids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;manufacturing roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They’re junior-level positions in finance, media, tech, and law — the exact tracks young professionals were steered toward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn’t signal the collapse of opportunity; it marks a necessary correction. One that exposes what we’ve been missing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Focused on the Wrong Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can’t replicate lived experience. It doesn’t read social signals in a client pitch, weigh complex trade-offs, or assess team dynamics mid-crisis. It doesn’t know when to push, when to pause, or how to build trust across functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those capabilities used to be built gradually — on the job, through exposure, mentorship, and real-world trial and error. But if AI is stepping into roles that once served as that training ground, we now face a new challenge: how to teach the human elements earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While tech skills are being automated at lightning speed, AI still lacks imagination, empathy, moral reasoning, and contextual awareness. In a world powered by machines, it’s no longer about having the right answer. It’s about knowing the right questions, reading the full picture, and leading people through uncertainty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We haven’t been preparing students for that. In the U.S., the percentage of degrees in the humanities has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators/higher-education/bachelors-degrees-humanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;dropped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from over 17% in the late 1960s to under 9% in 2022. Since the early 2000s, degrees in fields like English, history, and languages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/01/16/demographic-trends-in-the-us-philosophy-major-2001-2022-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;have nearly halved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Philosophy majors are now just 0.4% of all college graduates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We treated this as evolution. As practicality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re realizing it was a mistake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Skills Are the Real Competitive Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most crucial skills in this AI era aren’t “soft” — they’re essential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Empathy. Persuasion. Ethical reasoning. Cultural literacy. Systems thinking. Creativity in uncertain terrain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These skills are honed through literature, political science, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/four-commitments-of-successful-anthropological-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anthropology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ethics, philosophy, which are disciplines we’ve steadily pushed to the margins. Not because of nostalgia, but because they’re strategic assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when AI can produce answers instantly, the advantage goes to those who know what matters, how to frame problems, and how to communicate meaning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we want to prepare future workers for a world where machines handle the tasks, we must reinvest in what makes us human. That means restoring the humanities — not as electives, but as core professional competencies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means broadening how we evaluate talent to include clarity, curiosity, and adaptability, not just credentials. And it means recalibrating STEM education to include ethics, systems awareness, and human-centered thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t about going back in time. It’s about catching up with the world we’ve already stepped into. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We trained a generation for technical precision, just as that became commoditized by machines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now it’s time to invest in something AI can’t do: being deeply, powerfully human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when the bots deliver the output, the real value lies with the person who sees the bigger story, and knows why it matters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
